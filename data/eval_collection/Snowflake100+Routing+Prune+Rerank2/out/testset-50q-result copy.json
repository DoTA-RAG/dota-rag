    "question": "What makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item and how is it different from regular pieces?",
    "gold": "A Polish pottery Unikat (Signature) piece is special because it is hand painted using both sponges and brushes, and it is signed by the artist who painted it. These pieces are considered the most involving works of art, with larger Unikat items requiring several hours of very careful work to complete.",
    "answer": "A Polish pottery piece labeled as Unikat (Signature) is distinguished by being hand-painted with both sponges and brushes by an artist, and it is signed by the artist who painted it. This means that each Unikat piece is unique, with its own artistic touch, making it the most intricate and valuable work of art within the Polish pottery collection. The process of creating these items involves hours of careful work, especially for larger pieces, resulting in a piece that stands out due to its individual artistic expression. In contrast, regular Polish pottery pieces may be decorated using molds and stencils, resulting in a more uniform and mass-produced appearance. Unikat pieces are cherished by collectors for their uniqueness and the artistic skill involved in their creation.",

While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nWhat is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces. Same day shipping in many cases, reward points and friendly customer service are just a few reasons to visit their store.\n\nSo what is Polish Pottery anyway? Polish pottery has been popping up all over the United States in recent years. It’s been featured in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens. You can find pieces in stores and online. But if you’ve never seen it before, you might be wondering just what exactly is so great about it. So here are 5 great reasons to check out polish pottery for yourself. 1) Polish Pottery is handmade. Polish Pottery is made by hand out of white clay found in Boleslawiec, Poland. The patterns are all hand stamped and\/or hand designed by local artists. This means that each piece is slightly different, which adds to the charm of the pottery. 2) There’s something for everyone. There are hundreds of patterns available in Polish Pottery. Everything from the traditional peacock eye pattern, to beautiful flower patterns. There are seasonal patterns too! Snowmen for Christmas, stars and stripes for 4th of July…you name it and they make it. 3) Durability. I use my Polish Pottery every day and it still looks beautiful. It’s microwave safe, oven safe, and dishwasher safe. It doesn’t chip easily, and it evenly distributes heat to your food. 4) The endless ability to mix and match. Remember those hundreds of patterns we talked about earlier, well you can mix and match them to your heart’s content. Many of the pieces feature similar colors, so they look great together on your table. Decide that you’re bored with stars and peacock eyes, you can always buy a few Blue Tulip or Blue Poppy patterns to mix in. Endless possibilities means endless fun! 5) It’s simply beautiful.

You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black\/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black\/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.\n\nQuestion:What makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item and how is it different from regular pieces?",

            "passage": "Paula Shalan 18hx20'wx8'D \"Birches of acadia\" slab built, hand polished slip, sgraffito, smoke fired white earthenware\nA seed pod has a smooth exterior, and within, a richly complex structure. You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black\/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black\/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.",

    "gold": "No, the use of drones\/mini-copters is strictly prohibited at Crazy Horse Memorial.",
    "answer": "While using a drone to capture aerial views of popular landmarks like the Crazy Horse Memorial can be tempting, it's important to note that regulations regarding drone usage can vary by location. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees drone operations and generally requires a Remote Pilot Certificate for commercial drone use, which involves getting paid for photography or videography.\n\nHowever, for recreational use, the FAA has certain rules:\n\n1. You must keep your drone within visual line-of-sight.\n2. You cannot fly above 400 feet.\n3. You cannot fly near emergency response efforts.\n4. You must not fly over groups of people, stadiums, or crowded areas.\n5. You must not fly near moving vehicles on a highway, including the highway itself.\n6. You must not fly over non-public lands without permission.\n\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial is located in South Dakota, which is subject to these federal regulations. Additionally, specific locations, especially those that are tourist attractions, may have their own rules. The memorial itself may prohibit drone usage due to the sensitive nature of the site and to protect the integrity of the monument and the experience for visitors.\n\nBefore flying a drone over the Crazy Horse Memorial, it's highly recommended to check the latest regulations and guidelines, both from the FAA and from the site's management. You might want to contact the memorial directly or visit their official website to see if they allow drone photography and what their specific requirements are. This approach ensures that you respect both the law and the wishes of the site's management, while also helping to preserve the experience for all visitors.",

I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor.

We drove the short distance from Mount Rushmore to Crazy Horse Memorial, which is a bit different as it’s a memorial not yet completed. The Crazy Horse Memorial, is a tribute to the Lakota leader, Crazy Horse. He was a warrior and an instrumental part in the battle of Little Bighorn. He was killed in 1877 in Nebraska. He was only in his thirties. On September 6th every year, a night last at the memorial is held to honour Crazy Horse’s short but legendary life as well as the birth of the sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski. Ziolkowski was invited by Lakota Chief Henry Standing Beat to carve the sculpture of Crazy Horse. It stands to honour the culture and heritage of all North American Indians. Ziolkowski was unsure to begin with as he didn’t think Crazy Horse had necessarily done anything to perhaps warrant a memoria but it turns out it was to be more of a memorial to his spirit. His left hand would be pointed forward because he was asked by a white man once, “Where are your lands now?” Crazy Horse replied, “My lands are where my dead lie buried.” The Native Indians, had their own customs and way of living which was taken away from them after the battle of Little Bighorn. Ziolkowski maintened the idea that the memorial and foundation should be solely privately funded and nothing taken from the government. To this day it remains privately funded from tourists flocking to the visitors centre and surrounding areas. It also remained a family affair with Ziolkowski’s wife Ruth and ten children either working in the mountain , serving in the board or running the gift shop and visitors centre. They showed a video about this which was really quite moving! Ruth passed in 2014 but the children continue to work there!From here it was on to Jewel Cave National Monument.

Jewel Cave isn’t as long as Mammoth Cave and comes in at 189 miles and still exploring! Everywhere we have visited so far today sits in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Jewel cave was established as a national monument in 1908. Ranger Gregory asked “who by?” To which I replied Roosevelt, citing that it was the President, Theodore Roosevelt who designated it. I then got called a brown nose for the trip because I answered the “rhetorical question.” Or I have just paid attention to everywhere we have been…😂\nWe descended an elevator (yes an elevator in an old cave) to 240ft below the surface.The cave only had a mile explored when it became a national monument in 1908 and it wasn’t until the 1960s when Herb and Jan Conn spent 21 years leading caving trips and mapping 65 miles of the cave. Since then it has been explored to 189 miles with no sign of stopping! The map of the cave shows different levels depending on colour and each room and place that has been uncovered has been named. It’s a first come first name basis so whoever finds it, names it. There are some interesting names such as, the ‘big duh’ for the biggest room in the cave so far, ‘the good the bad and the ugly,’ ‘no way through,’ amongst others.

Rushmore, and I recall being non-plussed. Mountains are beautiful just as nature has sculpted them. It struck me as presumptuous in the midst of such scenery to carve faces of four dead presidents on the side of one. I declined to stop and pay to see Mt. Rushmore this trip, but was very glad I visited Crazy Horse. Eventually the grounds are to be home to a medical center and a university for Native Americans from throughout North America. Although the family and the memorial’s foundation could have raised funds by selling stone blasted from the mountain to be turned into gravel, they are keeping it all on site, where it will eventually be used in building those facilities. The visitor center is still a fair distance from the mountain itself. But you can hop on a school bus that takes you to the base of the mountain, and well worth the $4. These bus tours run about every 15 minutes during the summer and last about 25 minutes. You get to see the mountain from the far side of the visitor complex, then can disembark at the midpoint of the mountain. I thought I’d learned a lot from the orientation film, but our bus driver shared many more fascinating details. He’d clearly worked there a long time, knew the family, and cared about the mission of the place. The size of this thing is hard to grasp (all four presidents on Mt. Rushmore collectively are smaller than the face of Crazy Horse, if I recall what my bus guide said correctly). Here are photos from the base of the mountain I shot thanks to that bus ride. I had one more \"must-see\" on my list before heading to Rapid City for dinner: Iron Mountain Road. The 17-mile drive from Crazy Horse to Mt. Rushmore is so scenic and lush with trees, I didn’t mind the several stops I encountered for road construction and one-way traffic. I was surprised at what a close view I had of the dead presidents from Hwy. 244 as I drove past the entrance to Mt. Rushmore. But I would see them again – several times – after I turned south on 16A, that portion of which is known as Iron Mountain Road, part of the Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway. Norbeck was a South Dakota governor, U.S. senator, and conservationist whose name I’d seen repeatedly. Among the projects he championed for his native state of South Dakota were Mt. Rushmore and Iron Mountain Road, which features several more of those one-lane tunnels – these designed to perfectly frame views of Mt. Rushmore. At the top of Iron Mountain Road is a scenic pull-off where you can see Mt. Rushmore like this. It was disjarring to go from that kind of landscape to my motel in Rapid City on I-90. But I had a dinner reservation at The Corn Exchange, which I'd read somewhere was the best restaurant in South Dakota. This Western-casual-meets-fine-dining storefront in downtown Rapid City did not disappoint. My appetizer was this corn and scallion buttermilk pancake topped with house-smoked Black Hills trout, a cucumber-horseradish raita made with Cowgirl Creamery creme fraiche, and these spectacular eggs. For my entree, I went with a house specialty, the Corn Exchange steak, made that night with bison from local source 777 Buffalo Ranch. After such a great meal, I couldn't resist dessert, this lovely chocolate pot de creme with raspberries. A satisfying conclusion to a very memorable day. xoxo to all, and especially to my dad,\n\nQuestion:Can I use a drone to take pictures of Crazy Horse Memorial?",

            "passage": "Rushmore, to undertake the memorial “so the White Man would know the Red Man has great heroes also.”\nDuring that family trip 41 years ago, we stopped at Mt. Rushmore, and I recall being non-plussed. Mountains are beautiful just as nature has sculpted them. It struck me as presumptuous in the midst of such scenery to carve faces of four dead presidents on the side of one. I declined to stop and pay to see Mt. Rushmore this trip, but was very glad I visited Crazy Horse. Eventually the grounds are to be home to a medical center and a university for Native Americans from throughout North America. Although the family and the memorial’s foundation could have raised funds by selling stone blasted from the mountain to be turned into gravel, they are keeping it all on site, where it will eventually be used in building those facilities. The visitor center is still a fair distance from the mountain itself. But you can hop on a school bus that takes you to the base of the mountain, and well worth the $4. These bus tours run about every 15 minutes during the summer and last about 25 minutes. You get to see the mountain from the far side of the visitor complex, then can disembark at the midpoint of the mountain. I thought I’d learned a lot from the orientation film, but our bus driver shared many more fascinating details. He’d clearly worked there a long time, knew the family, and cared about the mission of the place. The size of this thing is hard to grasp (all four presidents on Mt. Rushmore collectively are smaller than the face of Crazy Horse, if I recall what my bus guide said correctly). Here are photos from the base of the mountain I shot thanks to that bus ride. I had one more \"must-see\" on my list before heading to Rapid City for dinner: Iron Mountain Road. The 17-mile drive from Crazy Horse to Mt. Rushmore is so scenic and lush with trees, I didn’t mind the several stops I encountered for road construction and one-way traffic. I was surprised at what a close view I had of the dead presidents from Hwy. 244 as I drove past the entrance to Mt. Rushmore. But I would see them again – several times – after I turned south on 16A, that portion of which is known as Iron Mountain Road, part of the Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway. Norbeck was a South Dakota governor, U.S. senator, and conservationist whose name I’d seen repeatedly. Among the projects he championed for his native state of South Dakota were Mt. Rushmore and Iron Mountain Road, which features several more of those one-lane tunnels – these designed to perfectly frame views of Mt. Rushmore. At the top of Iron Mountain Road is a scenic pull-off where you can see Mt. Rushmore like this. It was disjarring to go from that kind of landscape to my motel in Rapid City on I-90. But I had a dinner reservation at The Corn Exchange, which I'd read somewhere was the best restaurant in South Dakota. This Western-casual-meets-fine-dining storefront in downtown Rapid City did not disappoint. My appetizer was this corn and scallion buttermilk pancake topped with house-smoked Black Hills trout, a cucumber-horseradish raita made with Cowgirl Creamery creme fraiche, and these spectacular eggs. For my entree, I went with a house specialty, the Corn Exchange steak, made that night with bison from local source 777 Buffalo Ranch. After such a great meal, I couldn't resist dessert, this lovely chocolate pot de creme with raspberries. A satisfying conclusion to a very memorable day. xoxo to all, and especially to my dad,",

    "gold": "Service businesses can manage inventory using several methods, including the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) model for basic inventory control and its extensions. For businesses dealing with uncertain demand and lead times, there are specific models available. The newsvendor problem approach is particularly useful when dealing with perishable items or services with time-sensitive demand.",
    "answer": "Managing inventory for a service business can be a bit different than for a retail or manufacturing business. The focus is more on managing the resources needed to deliver the services, rather than physical products. Here are some best practices for inventory management in a service business:\n\n1. **Identify Essential Resources:** Begin by identifying the resources that are essential for delivering your services. This could include tools, equipment, materials, software, and even personnel. Understand the specific needs of each service to determine which resources are critical.\n\n2. **Implement Asset Management Systems:** Utilize inventory management software that can track not only physical items but also services and intangible assets. This software should be able to monitor usage, maintenance needs, and lifecycle costs of resources.\n\n3. **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Ensure that resources are allocated efficiently to meet service demands. This might involve scheduling technicians, planning maintenance, or ensuring that the necessary equipment is available when needed.\n\n4. **Regular Maintenance and Inventory Checks:** Regularly inspect equipment and supplies to ensure they are in good working order and replenish as necessary. Implement a preventive maintenance schedule to reduce the likelihood of breakdowns.\n\n5. **Demand Forecasting:** Use historical data and market trends to forecast the demand for your services. This will help in planning for resource requirements and avoiding over- or under-allocation.\n\n6. **Vendor Management:** Establish strong relationships with suppliers and vendors to ensure a steady supply of necessary materials and equipment. Consider diversifying your supply chain to mitigate risks.\n\n7. **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review your inventory management processes and outcomes. Look for ways to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance the quality of your services.\n\n8. **Compliance and Safety:** Ensure that all resources comply with relevant regulations and safety standards. This includes proper storage, handling, and usage of materials, as well as ensuring all personnel are adequately trained.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, a service business can effectively manage its inventory to provide high-quality services, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency.",

If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).\n\nPlus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories.

In today’s digital world, there is no excuse not to use technology to help manage a business. Discover the ways you can encourage your field service clients to increase their profitability and improve their business operations. As an accountant working with field service businesses, how do you help your clients manage, or increase, their profitability? If you want to add value to your field service partnerships, providing tools for your clients to run operations more efficiently, avoid losing profits and make smart decisions is something you might want to add to the top of your list. Here are three ways you can help your field service clients increase their profitability. Tip 1: Use workflow automation to streamline operations\nAlthough technology is widely used by businesses large and small, many businesses in the field service industry continue to run operations on paper. Field service management software, job management software, and other cloud-based software platforms provide workflow automation - the automatic execution of manual processes based on workflow rules. When businesses automate their processes, they can increase efficiency by working smarter rather than harder. How does workflow automation increase efficiency? Let’s say field staff are manually recording job details on paper and then bringing those slips of paper into a physical office. In this scenario, important information could go missing, office staff might spend unnecessary time deciphering messy handwriting, and data is recorded twice (once by their field staff and then again by the person handling billing and invoicing). Software with workflow automation capabilities as well as desktop and mobile features will help decrease the amount of errors created in transferring job details, remove the time spent on double data entry, and minimize the chance the information goes missing as it would now be automatically entered into your system. Overall, workflow automation helps businesses save time thus increasing billable hours, and increased billable hours leads to increased profits. Tip 2: Manage inventory from the cloud to avoid losing profits\nHow do your field service clients manage their inventory? Without a central location to track inventory and keep up with material costs, it is easy for field service businesses to lose track of what is in their warehouse or in the vans of their field staff. Encourage your clients to use inventory tracking software to gain full visibility of the materials on hand. This directly ties back into increasing profits as a clear picture into inventory levels will help these businesses make better purchasing decisions, avoid overstock and deter field staff from buying materials at a higher price on site. Some inventory management systems even allow users to import supplier catalogs and compare them side by side to determine the best pricing. Without cloud-based inventory management, field service businesses could be manually combing through supplier catalogs to find pricing, spend hours manually counting materials in their warehouse, or constantly need to follow up with field staff to determine what materials are on their vans. When all inventory-related information is housed in the cloud, determining inventory levels is quick and easy. Tip 3: Generate reports to make more profitable decisions\nWhen your field service clients have more information, you are able to help them make better-informed decisions. Generating reports through a field service management system is an easy way to gather data in one place and make sense of the data at hand. Encourage your clients to regularly use reporting in order to collect data from the day-to-day to discover trends within their business. For example, if a field service business wants to discover which jobs are most profitable versus those that are least profitable, a contract profitability report would be extremely helpful. This type of report would show the amount spent on resources and materials, the amount of time it took to complete a job or project, the total amount invoiced and other important details. Field service clients would be able to view the gross and net profits and compare across jobs to see which jobs are causing them to lose money and which ones bring in more money at less cost. Reporting on this type of information helps you assist your field service clients in making more profitable decisions. When your reporting is tied to a larger field service management solution, field service clients can automatically create reports based on data in their system and even set automation rules to receive scheduled reports at specified times. Workflow automation, cloud-based inventory management and reporting are three simple ways for field service businesses to successfully increase the profitability.

Inventory is often the largest asset a company has.\n\n5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.\n\nBecause inventories are often a sizable investment, they require careful management. But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.\n\nQuestion:What's the best way to manage inventory for a service business?",

            "passage": "Inventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process. If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).",

            "passage": "Plus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.",

            "passage": "Are your trade contacting clients taking advantage of technology solutions? In today’s digital world, there is no excuse not to use technology to help manage a business. Discover the ways you can encourage your field service clients to increase their profitability and improve their business operations. As an accountant working with field service businesses, how do you help your clients manage, or increase, their profitability? If you want to add value to your field service partnerships, providing tools for your clients to run operations more efficiently, avoid losing profits and make smart decisions is something you might want to add to the top of your list. Here are three ways you can help your field service clients increase their profitability. Tip 1: Use workflow automation to streamline operations\nAlthough technology is widely used by businesses large and small, many businesses in the field service industry continue to run operations on paper. Field service management software, job management software, and other cloud-based software platforms provide workflow automation - the automatic execution of manual processes based on workflow rules. When businesses automate their processes, they can increase efficiency by working smarter rather than harder. How does workflow automation increase efficiency? Let’s say field staff are manually recording job details on paper and then bringing those slips of paper into a physical office. In this scenario, important information could go missing, office staff might spend unnecessary time deciphering messy handwriting, and data is recorded twice (once by their field staff and then again by the person handling billing and invoicing). Software with workflow automation capabilities as well as desktop and mobile features will help decrease the amount of errors created in transferring job details, remove the time spent on double data entry, and minimize the chance the information goes missing as it would now be automatically entered into your system. Overall, workflow automation helps businesses save time thus increasing billable hours, and increased billable hours leads to increased profits. Tip 2: Manage inventory from the cloud to avoid losing profits\nHow do your field service clients manage their inventory? Without a central location to track inventory and keep up with material costs, it is easy for field service businesses to lose track of what is in their warehouse or in the vans of their field staff. Encourage your clients to use inventory tracking software to gain full visibility of the materials on hand. This directly ties back into increasing profits as a clear picture into inventory levels will help these businesses make better purchasing decisions, avoid overstock and deter field staff from buying materials at a higher price on site. Some inventory management systems even allow users to import supplier catalogs and compare them side by side to determine the best pricing. Without cloud-based inventory management, field service businesses could be manually combing through supplier catalogs to find pricing, spend hours manually counting materials in their warehouse, or constantly need to follow up with field staff to determine what materials are on their vans. When all inventory-related information is housed in the cloud, determining inventory levels is quick and easy. Tip 3: Generate reports to make more profitable decisions\nWhen your field service clients have more information, you are able to help them make better-informed decisions. Generating reports through a field service management system is an easy way to gather data in one place and make sense of the data at hand. Encourage your clients to regularly use reporting in order to collect data from the day-to-day to discover trends within their business. For example, if a field service business wants to discover which jobs are most profitable versus those that are least profitable, a contract profitability report would be extremely helpful. This type of report would show the amount spent on resources and materials, the amount of time it took to complete a job or project, the total amount invoiced and other important details. Field service clients would be able to view the gross and net profits and compare across jobs to see which jobs are causing them to lose money and which ones bring in more money at less cost. Reporting on this type of information helps you assist your field service clients in making more profitable decisions. When your reporting is tied to a larger field service management solution, field service clients can automatically create reports based on data in their system and even set automation rules to receive scheduled reports at specified times. Workflow automation, cloud-based inventory management and reporting are three simple ways for field service businesses to successfully increase the profitability.

            "passage": "5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

            "passage": "Everyone knows inventory out means money in, but without a clear view of your goods from initial receipt to ship date, your company’s largest asset could be losing you money. The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.",

            "passage": "Because inventories are often a sizable investment, they require careful management. But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.",

    "answer": "The benefits of having four-day school weeks, according to the various sources, include:\n\n1. **Financial Savings:** Schools can save on costs associated with busing, utilities, maintenance, and food services by eliminating one day of operation.\n\n2. **Increased Teacher and Student Attendance:** Teachers may have better attendance due to the ability to schedule non-classroom activities (like meetings or doctor's appointments) on the fifth day. Student attendance can also improve, particularly at the high school level.\n\n3. **Improved Student Discipline and Engagement:** Some studies and accounts suggest that students are more engaged and disciplined in a four-day week, possibly due to more strenuous and rigorous classes.\n\n4. **Enhanced Teacher Vitality and Morale:** With an extra day off, teachers have more time to plan lessons, grade, and spend time with their families, leading to increased morale and decreased burnout.\n\n5. **Better Family Time:** Both students and staff have an extra day to spend with their families, which can enhance home-school relationships.\n\n6. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** A four-day week allows for more flexibility in scheduling, including the ability to better accommodate national holidays without losing instructional days.\n\n7. **Potential for Cost Savings to Be Reinvested:** Districts may use the savings from a four-day week to fund additional programs or resources, such as technology, that can enhance the educational experience.\n\n8. **Improved Student Performance:** Some studies indicate that switching to a four-day week might not harm and can even improve student performance, particularly in rural districts.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that these benefits are not universally accepted, and the effectiveness of a four-day week can vary based on the specific needs, resources, and context of each school district. Critics often raise concerns about the impact on student learning, particularly regarding the potential for decreased retention of material over the longer weekend, as well as the logistical challenges and costs related to childcare on the fifth day.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Crosscut recently reported on the Eatonville School District's consideration of a four-day school week, which is already being used by two rural school districts with fewer than 150 students in Eastern Washington. During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.\n\nMost districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”\n\nDriven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https:\/\/t.co\/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.\n\nAfter considering information garnered from three public meetings and a community survey, the North Branch Area Public Schools School Board decided Thursday to stay with a four-day school week. The decision to keep with the status quo was approved by a 3-2 vote. Board member Kirby Ekstrom was absent. Kim Salo, Tim MacMillan and Linda Heidelberger voted in approval, with Randy Westby and Jay Falk casting dissenting votes. For the past three years, the district has operated under the four-day week model. Students don’t attend classes Mondays, but the amount of time per year they’re in school is the same as it had been under the five-day week because the school days are longer. It was implemented as a cost-saving measure for the district when it faced significant budget shortfalls due to inequity in the state school funding formula and an inability to secure a voter-approved operating levy. Superintendent Deb Henton told the board those factors have not changed and moving back to the five-day week model would have led to more staff reduction. The district can now apply to the state again to use the four-day week model for the next three years, but it has the option to opt out at any point. Under the four-day week, the district will have to continue to look at budget adjustments, but it will be able to offer more courses and programming, which could attract more families to the area, Henton noted. Under the five-day week, the equivalent of five teaching positions would have been cut, with some programming being reduced or eliminated. Some positions slated for removal were half time or less. When added together, the positions equaled about five full-time instructional jobs. North Branch Area High School Principal Coleman McDonough said with the five-day week model, German would have been cut from the school’s world language program, and it would have diminished the ability to have Project Lead The Way move into the high school. That initiative is already underway in the junior high; it’s an educational plan that stresses the use of more high-tech equipment in classrooms. The aim of Project Lead The Way is to provide students with problem-solving skills they could use to obtain jobs that might not even exist today. The board is also looking at bringing an Air Force JROTC program into the high school. Having a five-day week and subsequently less discretionary money would have hindered the school’s ability to offer the program. At Sunrise River Elementary School, a half-day option for kindergarten would not have been offered under the five-day week, Principal Jason Hartmann noted. Todd Tezlaff, the middle school principal, said fewer courses would have been available to students with the five-day week. “We’d have a limitation with offerings,” he said, noting having a variety of programming is integral for student development. “Middle school is when they find things they’re interested in.”\nStudent enrollment still an issue\nWestby, like he has at previous meetings, said he was not in favor of the four-day week because he views it as a detriment to bringing more families with children into the district. “I know (declining enrollment) is a great factor,” he said. “That comes with a four-day week at this point in time. I see that as our biggest threat.”\nHe added he sees benefits to the four-day week, but said North Branch schools are falling behind other districts in the state the longer it continues. “It’s time to get back on a level playing field,” he said. “We have to be competitive, which means five days.”\nBoard member Tim MacMillan said the board had to make a tough decision about how many days students go to school per week, but stressed the board is using its resources to the best of its ability. “These are not easy decisions to make,” he said. “We’re in the business of educating kids, and I think we’re doing a great job.”\n\nSenate OKs plan to push school districts to 5-day weeks\nA plan to force more Oklahoma school districts to return to five-day school weeks has cleared the Oklahoma Senate. The Senate voted 31-17 on Thursday for the bill that now goes to the House. According to the state Department of Education, 92 of Oklahoma's more than 500 school districts currently are operating on four-day school weeks. In those cases, instructional hours are extended each day to reach the required number of hours. The bill by Republican Sen. Marty Quinn would allow schools to continue operating four-day weeks if the district meets minimum guidelines for student performance and cost savings. Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister praised the Senate's passage of the measure. Supporters of the four-day school week says it helps districts save money and recruit teachers.\n\nYou get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). Short breaks gives time for kids to have a better education and avoids kids getting too board over the long break. Yeah, you wouldn’t get to have 3 week vacations, but who does? Some kids say that they get a break right when they need it and it’s refreshing to them and they’re ready to listen (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). It would be easier for them to pick up where they left\nAttending school on a year-round calendar or a traditional calendar is a huge debate in the school districts across the United States. It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents. Moreover, small high schools result in a wider array of student involvement. Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in. His narrative shows this support and how having instruction in Spanish and English allows him to have higher academics. In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed. Many of the schools in the United States do not give out E’s as\n(“Year-round education: Is summer vacation over... forever?”). This is significant because a great deal of children that had summer vacations before year round schooling have lost it because of year round schooling. Another piece of evidence would be that people are losing educate that they get in summer. 71 percent of adults not just including parents state that kids get educate from lessons during the months of summer by pursuing, working, athletics, or attending camp (“Year-round education: Is summer vacation\nShould There Be Year Round School? Studies show that learning in year round school increases less than 1%. There are many reason why there should be year round school, but here are some reasons why there shouldn’t be year round school. Continue reading if you want to know why there shouldn’t be year round school. One reason why there shouldn’t be year round school is because kids need a break from school. Second it messes with students and parents schedule. Plus it ruins summer. Most schools go 180 days a year with breaks in between then you get out and can enjoy your summer June through July. With year round schools you still go the traditional 180 days, of course with breaks in between, but you have to go to school in the summer so all you get off in the summer is June. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t go to a year round school, here are a few.\n\nAs parents filled the library at Mountain View Core Knowledge School on Monday, principal Karen Sartori passed out a map of Colorado school districts that are on four-day school weeks. In every district that surrounds Cañon City, parents noticed, schools are in session one fewer day than Mountain View, Cañon City's only charter school. At a meeting with parents Monday, the school discussed what it might be like to put the school on the map. \"We still are in the exploration phase,\" Sartori said, adding that the discussion was prompted by parents. \"We're responding, saying 'What is it? What is that our families want?'\" After it hosted accountability meetings last year, the kindergarten through eighth-grade school found that several parents were interested in opening a charter high school and moving to a four-day school week, which is something the neighboring Florence-Penrose School District did in August. \"I think with Florence going to that, that prompted more people to ask about it,\" Sartori said. And in a survey sent out to Mountain View parents, 70 percent of those who responded said they favored the four-day week. But at Monday's meeting, which was set up as a way to determine the level of interest, parents shared concerns, ranging from child care on Fridays to homework after longer school days. At the meeting, Sartori and the Mountain View governing board emphasized that no decision has been made yet, despite a feeling from some parents in the audience that the school already was moving forward with the plan. \"It's not been decided that it should be done yet,\" Sartori said, adding that the school plans to host another meeting at a later time for more parents. \"We still are in the exploration phase.\" Brad Mitchell, the board's president, agreed. \"As a board, please know that the reason we're having this meeting is because it's not a done deal,\" he said. \"We want to see what our parents think.\" For Mountain View, getting rid of a day would mean the school would have to absorb those lost hours into the four other days. Colorado's attendance law requires that secondary students attend school for 150 days or 1,056 hours. Elementary students are required to attend 140 days, or 986 hours, of school. \"What that would look like is adding about 10 minutes to each of the academic subjects throughout the day,\" Sartori said, adding that by the end of each day, those extra minutes would add up to one hour. Right now, she said, Mountain View exceeds that time requirement, with five-day weeks that run from 7:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. each day. Under the current calendar, that means students are in class for 1,197 hours, or 171 days. Still, some parents were concerned about what even longer days might mean for students, especially those in younger grades. One parent, who has a kindergartner at the school, said that by the time 3 p.m. comes around, her child is unfocused. \"The little ones are the ones you worry the most about with that longer day,\" Sartori said, adding that the school could look into giving younger students rest time. \"Recess is important, those brain breaks that we already take are very important.\" Kathie Branam, the parent of a Mountain View fourth-grader, also has one student at Cañon City High School and two students in the Florence-Penrose School District, which saw a slight bump in enrollment after implementing its four-day week. For one of Branam's sons, a student at Fremont Middle School, the four-day week has taken a toll. \"He has ADD, and he's exhausted by the end of the day,\" she said. \"He sleeps on the way home, sleeps 'til dinner. I him wake up for dinner ... and then he goes back to sleep.\" Still, Branam didn't want to rule out the four-day week completely. Her other son, a senior at Florence High School, has found success at with the modified schedule. \"My high school kid loves it. He's more into trades,\" she said. \"He really wants to do construction, so doing a four-day week was great for him, and he's able to get out and get some job experience before he graduates so he'll have a job when he leaves.\" Unlike the Florence-Penrose School District, switching to a four-day week wouldn't mean more students for Mountain View.\n\nIowa District Puts Twist on Four-Day Week\nAs more districts adopt four-day weeks to cope with budget crunches, one rural Iowa district says it is embracing the practice for a different reason: to squeeze more time out of the school calendar for student enrichment and teachers’ professional development. Starting this school year, students in the 550-student WACO community school district will attend school Monday through Thursday, spending an hour longer in class each day so that no classes will need to be held on Fridays. Students in the district—which serves the communities of Wayland, Crawfordsville, and Olds—have the option of attending remedial or enrichment classes every other Friday or to enroll in college-level classes. This new plan for the school year follows the June 2013 passage of Iowa’s House File 215, which officially defines the state’s school year length requirements in both days and hours. Under the new law, a full school year is defined as having at least 1,080 hours, or an equivalent 180 days, of instruction, but it’s up to districts to inform the state of which metric they will use to measure their school year—in hours or days. Iowa isn’t alone in this shift. More states nationwide are altering their definitions of the school year from days to hours to allow more scheduling flexibility, according to Kathy Christie, the chief of staff at the Education Commission of the States, based in Denver. More than 20 states have districts operating on four-day weeks, according to the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy at Indiana University Bloomington. According to Ms. Christie, districts—especially those in rural areas—are typically lured to the four-day week as a possible form of relief from budget woes. They see the condensed schedule as a way to reduce costs associated with busing and utilities. In rural southern Idaho, for example, officials of the Wendell school district say budget concerns are driving their district’s move to a four-day week this academic year. The 1,200-student district hopes that the new schedule will cut down on transportation and utility costs and on student absences, since schools receive much of their funding based on how many students attend. Superintendent Gregory Lowe said: “With the cuts we had here in Idaho, we thought this would lead to savings for our struggling budget, but we also felt like it was a good thing for students.”\nHowever, like Iowa’s WACO district, Wendell isn’t planning on letting its Fridays go to waste. It will use those days for teacher professional development, to provide extra help for students through a program called the Success Alliance, or for enrichment activities, depending on the week. The Fridays set aside for professional development will be focused on instructional strategies for the Common Core State Standards. Results in Practice\nMeanwhile, another rural district, the MACCRAY school system, which serves Maynard, Clara City, and Raymond in Minnesota, is entering its fifth school year with a four-day week. For the most part, community feedback on the switch has been positive, according to the 650-student district. “Parents really like it,” said Gary Simms, the principal of MACCRAY Senior High School, “and because we have one less day, we save on busing, on utilities, on maintenance time. We save a bit on food service.”\nThe district decided to cut Monday out of its school week to reduce absenteeism as well, since parents can now schedule doctor or other appointments for their children on that day, and now absenteeism rates are “maybe a little better than before,” according to Mr. Simms. While child care is one concern often brought up with four-day-week districts, Mr. Simms said the MACCRAY district hasn’t heard many complaints. “If parents know when they will need a babysitter, 99 percent are responsible enough to get one,” he said. Even though belt-tightening is driving many of the switches to four-day schedules, Ms. Christie of the ECS said that “cost-saving is not a reason to make the switch.”\nThat’s because calculations of the savings produced by the schedule change have shown them to be minimal, she said. Reducing the school week from five days to four doesn’t automatically translate to big savings, according to analysts.\n\nDUNCAN: We have a significantly shorter school year: 20, 25, 30 days versus India, versus China, other places. Our students are at a competitive disadvantage. BOLDUAN: The major argument for extending school time is summer learning loss. Researchers have found students can lose about a month's worth of achievement during the summer break. ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nFour-Day School Week\nAZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go\nAZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion! It happened in Atlanta this weekend when DragonCon rolled into town and brought some creative costumes with it. The sci-fi and comic convention always has an interesting cast of characters: Interplanetary predators? Yep. Old-school robots? Uh-huh. People willing to paint their face blue for no apparent reason? Got that too. Even a Sith lord couldn't stay away! AZUZ: We had some ideas for Darth Vader puns, but we didn't want to force anything. Wookie here, we've reached the end of today's show.

    "passages": [
        {
            "passage": "Crosscut recently reported on the Eatonville School District's consideration of a four-day school week, which is already being used by two rural school districts with fewer than 150 students in Eastern Washington. During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.",

            "passage": "Most districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”",

            "passage": "Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https:\/\/t.co\/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.",

            "passage": "After considering information garnered from three public meetings and a community survey, the North Branch Area Public Schools School Board decided Thursday to stay with a four-day school week. The decision to keep with the status quo was approved by a 3-2 vote. Board member Kirby Ekstrom was absent. Kim Salo, Tim MacMillan and Linda Heidelberger voted in approval, with Randy Westby and Jay Falk casting dissenting votes. For the past three years, the district has operated under the four-day week model. Students don’t attend classes Mondays, but the amount of time per year they’re in school is the same as it had been under the five-day week because the school days are longer. It was implemented as a cost-saving measure for the district when it faced significant budget shortfalls due to inequity in the state school funding formula and an inability to secure a voter-approved operating levy. Superintendent Deb Henton told the board those factors have not changed and moving back to the five-day week model would have led to more staff reduction. The district can now apply to the state again to use the four-day week model for the next three years, but it has the option to opt out at any point. Under the four-day week, the district will have to continue to look at budget adjustments, but it will be able to offer more courses and programming, which could attract more families to the area, Henton noted. Under the five-day week, the equivalent of five teaching positions would have been cut, with some programming being reduced or eliminated. Some positions slated for removal were half time or less. When added together, the positions equaled about five full-time instructional jobs. North Branch Area High School Principal Coleman McDonough said with the five-day week model, German would have been cut from the school’s world language program, and it would have diminished the ability to have Project Lead The Way move into the high school. That initiative is already underway in the junior high; it’s an educational plan that stresses the use of more high-tech equipment in classrooms. The aim of Project Lead The Way is to provide students with problem-solving skills they could use to obtain jobs that might not even exist today. The board is also looking at bringing an Air Force JROTC program into the high school. Having a five-day week and subsequently less discretionary money would have hindered the school’s ability to offer the program. At Sunrise River Elementary School, a half-day option for kindergarten would not have been offered under the five-day week, Principal Jason Hartmann noted. Todd Tezlaff, the middle school principal, said fewer courses would have been available to students with the five-day week. “We’d have a limitation with offerings,” he said, noting having a variety of programming is integral for student development. “Middle school is when they find things they’re interested in.”\nStudent enrollment still an issue\nWestby, like he has at previous meetings, said he was not in favor of the four-day week because he views it as a detriment to bringing more families with children into the district. “I know (declining enrollment) is a great factor,” he said. “That comes with a four-day week at this point in time. I see that as our biggest threat.”\nHe added he sees benefits to the four-day week, but said North Branch schools are falling behind other districts in the state the longer it continues. “It’s time to get back on a level playing field,” he said. “We have to be competitive, which means five days.”\nBoard member Tim MacMillan said the board had to make a tough decision about how many days students go to school per week, but stressed the board is using its resources to the best of its ability. “These are not easy decisions to make,” he said. “We’re in the business of educating kids, and I think we’re doing a great job.”",

It would be easier for them to pick up where they left\nAttending school on a year-round calendar or a traditional calendar is a huge debate in the school districts across the United States. It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents.

Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in.

In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed.

In every district that surrounds Cañon City, parents noticed, schools are in session one fewer day than Mountain View, Cañon City's only charter school. At a meeting with parents Monday, the school discussed what it might be like to put the school on the map. \"We still are in the exploration phase,\" Sartori said, adding that the discussion was prompted by parents. \"We're responding, saying 'What is it? What is that our families want?'\" After it hosted accountability meetings last year, the kindergarten through eighth-grade school found that several parents were interested in opening a charter high school and moving to a four-day school week, which is something the neighboring Florence-Penrose School District did in August. \"I think with Florence going to that, that prompted more people to ask about it,\" Sartori said. And in a survey sent out to Mountain View parents, 70 percent of those who responded said they favored the four-day week. But at Monday's meeting, which was set up as a way to determine the level of interest, parents shared concerns, ranging from child care on Fridays to homework after longer school days. At the meeting, Sartori and the Mountain View governing board emphasized that no decision has been made yet, despite a feeling from some parents in the audience that the school already was moving forward with the plan. \"It's not been decided that it should be done yet,\" Sartori said, adding that the school plans to host another meeting at a later time for more parents. \"We still are in the exploration phase.\" Brad Mitchell, the board's president, agreed. \"As a board, please know that the reason we're having this meeting is because it's not a done deal,\" he said. \"We want to see what our parents think.\" For Mountain View, getting rid of a day would mean the school would have to absorb those lost hours into the four other days. Colorado's attendance law requires that secondary students attend school for 150 days or 1,056 hours. Elementary students are required to attend 140 days, or 986 hours, of school. \"What that would look like is adding about 10 minutes to each of the academic subjects throughout the day,\" Sartori said, adding that by the end of each day, those extra minutes would add up to one hour. Right now, she said, Mountain View exceeds that time requirement, with five-day weeks that run from 7:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. each day. Under the current calendar, that means students are in class for 1,197 hours, or 171 days. Still, some parents were concerned about what even longer days might mean for students, especially those in younger grades. One parent, who has a kindergartner at the school, said that by the time 3 p.m. comes around, her child is unfocused. \"The little ones are the ones you worry the most about with that longer day,\" Sartori said, adding that the school could look into giving younger students rest time. \"Recess is important, those brain breaks that we already take are very important.\" Kathie Branam, the parent of a Mountain View fourth-grader, also has one student at Cañon City High School and two students in the Florence-Penrose School District, which saw a slight bump in enrollment after implementing its four-day week. For one of Branam's sons, a student at Fremont Middle School, the four-day week has taken a toll. \"He has ADD, and he's exhausted by the end of the day,\" she said. \"He sleeps on the way home, sleeps 'til dinner. I him wake up for dinner ... and then he goes back to sleep.\" Still, Branam didn't want to rule out the four-day week completely. Her other son, a senior at Florence High School, has found success at with the modified schedule. \"My high school kid loves it. He's more into trades,\" she said. \"He really wants to do construction, so doing a four-day week was great for him, and he's able to get out and get some job experience before he graduates so he'll have a job when he leaves.\" Unlike the Florence-Penrose School District, switching to a four-day week wouldn't mean more students for Mountain View.",

            "passage": "Iowa District Puts Twist on Four-Day Week\nAs more districts adopt four-day weeks to cope with budget crunches, one rural Iowa district says it is embracing the practice for a different reason: to squeeze more time out of the school calendar for student enrichment and teachers’ professional development. Starting this school year, students in the 550-student WACO community school district will attend school Monday through Thursday, spending an hour longer in class each day so that no classes will need to be held on Fridays. Students in the district—which serves the communities of Wayland, Crawfordsville, and Olds—have the option of attending remedial or enrichment classes every other Friday or to enroll in college-level classes. This new plan for the school year follows the June 2013 passage of Iowa’s House File 215, which officially defines the state’s school year length requirements in both days and hours. Under the new law, a full school year is defined as having at least 1,080 hours, or an equivalent 180 days, of instruction, but it’s up to districts to inform the state of which metric they will use to measure their school year—in hours or days. Iowa isn’t alone in this shift. More states nationwide are altering their definitions of the school year from days to hours to allow more scheduling flexibility, according to Kathy Christie, the chief of staff at the Education Commission of the States, based in Denver. More than 20 states have districts operating on four-day weeks, according to the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy at Indiana University Bloomington. According to Ms. Christie, districts—especially those in rural areas—are typically lured to the four-day week as a possible form of relief from budget woes. They see the condensed schedule as a way to reduce costs associated with busing and utilities. In rural southern Idaho, for example, officials of the Wendell school district say budget concerns are driving their district’s move to a four-day week this academic year. The 1,200-student district hopes that the new schedule will cut down on transportation and utility costs and on student absences, since schools receive much of their funding based on how many students attend. Superintendent Gregory Lowe said: “With the cuts we had here in Idaho, we thought this would lead to savings for our struggling budget, but we also felt like it was a good thing for students.”\nHowever, like Iowa’s WACO district, Wendell isn’t planning on letting its Fridays go to waste. It will use those days for teacher professional development, to provide extra help for students through a program called the Success Alliance, or for enrichment activities, depending on the week. The Fridays set aside for professional development will be focused on instructional strategies for the Common Core State Standards. Results in Practice\nMeanwhile, another rural district, the MACCRAY school system, which serves Maynard, Clara City, and Raymond in Minnesota, is entering its fifth school year with a four-day week. For the most part, community feedback on the switch has been positive, according to the 650-student district. “Parents really like it,” said Gary Simms, the principal of MACCRAY Senior High School, “and because we have one less day, we save on busing, on utilities, on maintenance time. We save a bit on food service.”\nThe district decided to cut Monday out of its school week to reduce absenteeism as well, since parents can now schedule doctor or other appointments for their children on that day, and now absenteeism rates are “maybe a little better than before,” according to Mr. Simms. While child care is one concern often brought up with four-day-week districts, Mr. Simms said the MACCRAY district hasn’t heard many complaints. “If parents know when they will need a babysitter, 99 percent are responsible enough to get one,” he said. Even though belt-tightening is driving many of the switches to four-day schedules, Ms. Christie of the ECS said that “cost-saving is not a reason to make the switch.”\nThat’s because calculations of the savings produced by the schedule change have shown them to be minimal, she said. Reducing the school week from five days to four doesn’t automatically translate to big savings, according to analysts.",

BOLDUAN: The major argument for extending school time is summer learning loss. Researchers have found students can lose about a month's worth of achievement during the summer break. ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nFour-Day School Week\nAZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go\nAZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion! It happened in Atlanta this weekend when DragonCon rolled into town and brought some creative costumes with it. The sci-fi and comic convention always has an interesting cast of characters: Interplanetary predators? Yep. Old-school robots? Uh-huh. People willing to paint their face blue for no apparent reason? Got that too. Even a Sith lord couldn't stay away! AZUZ: We had some ideas for Darth Vader puns, but we didn't want to force anything. Wookie here, we've reached the end of today's show.

We can't help without that. This topic has been closed to new replies.\n\nRecently I was engaged on setting up mail client on the new redhat (rhel6) server for one of my clients. The server was on its default setup of sendmail. Since it is a bit outdated, I decided to use postfix relaying on gmail SMTP. First thing first, make sure sendmail is not running by running this command\nsudo service sendmail stop\nMake sure if there are any lingering processes out there by issuing proper process listing commands on your server and kill those if you have to\nThen check if you have postfix installed your machine\nsudo service postfix start\nIf you got any complaint like service not found or something along that line, just install the postfix\nsudo yum install postfix\nOk now lets go to the juicy part of integrating the postfix with gmail SMTP. Lets assume your username is email@example.com and password is #nomoresendmail\nNow lets proceed to the configuration part of the postfix. go to postfix config folder\nHere you will see a couple of files. Our interest would be on the main.cf file\nFirst, before you start messing with the file, create a copy of it\nsudo cp mail.cp main.cp.bak\nJust go to the end of file and add the following snippet in there\nsmtp_use_tls = yes smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:\/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous smtp_tls_CAfile = \/etc\/pki\/tls\/certs\/self.pem relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587\nThat last line right there would tell the postfix it has to relay the SMTP to other server. Now lets create the sasl_passwd file\nsudo touch sasl_passwd echo \"[smtp.gmail.com]:587 firstname.lastname@example.org:#nomoresendmail\" > sasl_passwd\nThe above command would add the content to the sasl_passwd file. Then to obscure the password information you placed on in the sasl_passwd file,\nsudo postmap \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd\nThe other point would be creating a self certificate you would be using for your secure communication. If you have a certificate you are using already, then just point it to the right place and you should be fine\ncd \/etc\/pki\/tls\/certs\/ make self.pem\nThe above command would give you interactive wizard that you will follow and create the certificate. After this, you need to tell the postfix to pick the changes you have been ramming. For that just restart postfix\nsudo service postfix restart\nThen open your logger to see if there are anything that are suspicious going or if mail is not working, you can tail it as\n1.

If you have any additional questions on the Zapier side, you can reach out to firstname.lastname@example.org\n\nMany times in the past I’ve configured Linux server (in this case, specifically Ubuntu LTS Servers ) where I need to recieve automated emails such as CRON logs etc. to an external email account but don’t want or need the hassle of configuring a fully blown SMTP server with SPF records, DKIM signing etc. etc. so in this very quick tutorial I’ll demonstrate how you can use a standard Google Mail (GMail) account to relay all server emails through, this will ensure that emails are safely delivered without being picked up as SPAM etc. by many third-party mail server providers. Beware however that ALL emails sent from the server regardless of setting any ‘from address’ or ‘from name’ will appear to come from your actual GMail address and name (Google forces this!) so I’d recommend using this for servers where you are the sole recipient of any emails such as automated administration emails, if you intend to send emails from a web application server to many public users I’d recommend either setting up a Postfix to send direct (and therefore ensuring that all DNS entries are configured correctly) or use a dedicated SMTP relay service like SendGrid or DNSExit’s Mail Relay Outbound Service. Anyway, lets get a move on…\nSo technically we will be installing and configuring Postfix as a ‘smarthost’, so first of all lets install Postfix on the server like so:-\napt-get install postfix\nNext, the deb-installer will prompt you for your desired Postfix configuration settings, these are the settings that you should use:-\n- Type of mail server: Satellite System\n- Mail name: example.org (the name you want for your outbound mail)\n- SMTP relay host: smtp.gmail.com\n- Postmaster: (You can leave this blank if you wish, this server will not be configured to receive emails)\n- Other destinations: (I’ve left this blank!) - Synchronous Queues: (Your choice, I left this as default, this won’t affect the relaying of emails)\n- Network blocks to allow relay: (Leave as default unless you want to allow all machines in your LAN etc to relay through this relay server, make sure you know what you are doing here though!) - Mailbox size: (Your choice, this is for incoming email only and therefore is not really important, I just left it as default!) - Local address: (I left it as default ‘+’)\n- Listen address: (Again, this is your choice, the default will do if you don’t want to segregate your network cards and access from other internal sub-domains, I therefore just left this as default also!) Fantastic, we are now nearly there! We now just need to make some changes tho the main Postfix configuration file located in \/etc\/postfix\/main.cf and add some extra configuration options to enable TLS and the Gmail account password required to send emails via. Gmail. So now, edit the file using Vi or Nano for example, like so:-\n…and now add the following lines to the bottom of this file:-\nsmtp_use_tls=yes smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:\/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous\nNow we create the username\/password authentication file, using Vi or Nano, create a new file here: \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd, the contents should be as follows:-\nYou obviously need to replace the above example with your own email address and ‘PASSWORD’ should be replaced with your current Gmail password. For best practice it is advisable that you change the ownership of the credentials files that you’ve just created and set restrictive permissions so that others with access to the server can not view the Gmail account credentials, lets do this now like so:\nchmod 640 \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd* chown postfix:postfix \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd*\nNow we need to rebuild the hash, execute the following command:-\nNow finally, for the changes to take effect lets now restart Postfix so that emails can start being relayed:-\nservice postfix restart\nThat is it!\n\nHere's what I want to do. I have an Ubuntu box (Edgy-Eft) at home, and I want to be able to send out email, and I want to use gmail as my relayhost. There are several sites online that explain bits of how to do this, and Mike Chirico's is particularly good. I used his tutorial as a starting point, but I noticed I had to do a few things differently to get it working on my own system, so I'm documenting the differences. Disclaimer: Different about my setup is that I am using the Ubuntu packages, whereas Chirico's tutorial has you compile the packages yourself. There's nothing wrong with doing that, in fact, it's probably good for your soul, but I'd prefer to make use of the Ubuntu package manager as much as possible. Further, I'm not interested in using fetchmail, so I've done nothing with that. The first thing I did was install postfix. # apt-get install postfixI told the configuration script that I was installing for an internet site. Happily, debian\/ubuntu's postfix comes with TLS and SASL compiled in. Generate Your CertificatesIn order to connect to gmail, you need a certificate. Here's what happened when I generated my certificate. # \/usr\/lib\/ssl\/misc\/CA.pl -newca CA certificate filename (or enter to create) Making CA certificate ... Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key .....................++++++ .........................++++++ writing new private key to '.\/demoCA\/private\/cakey.pem' Enter PEM pass phrase: Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.

Not only does this enable you to take information out of your app but also ensures you can control actions inside the app based on your preferences. To get started, you will need a Zapier account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up here: https:\/\/zapier.com\/sign-up\/\nWhen you've secured your account let us know and we will turn it on for you in the Console. Setting Up the Zaps\nMost of it is controlled on Zapier's side which you can find on your app dashboard: https:\/\/zapier.com\/app\/dashboard\nTo get up and running, you'll need to connect your Zapier account with Disciple. To do this simply let your Customer Success Manager know that you're intending to use the Zapier integration and they'll switch it on for you. Once confirmed, navigate to the Integrations tab on the Console, generate an API Key, and add it to Zapier. Navigate to \"My Apps\" In Zapier, then select an \"add a connection\". From here search for Disciple and you will see the following screen. Take the API key you retrieved from the console and away you go, it really is that easy.

Our interest would be on the main.cf file\nFirst, before you start messing with the file, create a copy of it\nsudo cp mail.cp main.cp.bak\nJust go to the end of file and add the following snippet in there\nsmtp_use_tls = yes smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:\/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous smtp_tls_CAfile = \/etc\/pki\/tls\/certs\/self.pem relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587\nThat last line right there would tell the postfix it has to relay the SMTP to other server. Now lets create the sasl_passwd file\nsudo touch sasl_passwd echo \"[smtp.gmail.com]:587 firstname.lastname@example.org:#nomoresendmail\" > sasl_passwd\nThe above command would add the content to the sasl_passwd file. Then to obscure the password information you placed on in the sasl_passwd file,\nsudo postmap \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd\nThe other point would be creating a self certificate you would be using for your secure communication. If you have a certificate you are using already, then just point it to the right place and you should be fine\ncd \/etc\/pki\/tls\/certs\/ make self.pem\nThe above command would give you interactive wizard that you will follow and create the certificate. After this, you need to tell the postfix to pick the changes you have been ramming. For that just restart postfix\nsudo service postfix restart\nThen open your logger to see if there are anything that are suspicious going or if mail is not working, you can tail it as\n1. Google might be sending some kind of error saying you have to log into the web browser bla bla bla.. then do the following\nGo to https:\/\/www.google.com\/settings\/security\/lesssecureapps and login with your google account and turn it on",

            "passage": "Many times in the past I’ve configured Linux server (in this case, specifically Ubuntu LTS Servers ) where I need to recieve automated emails such as CRON logs etc. to an external email account but don’t want or need the hassle of configuring a fully blown SMTP server with SPF records, DKIM signing etc. etc. so in this very quick tutorial I’ll demonstrate how you can use a standard Google Mail (GMail) account to relay all server emails through, this will ensure that emails are safely delivered without being picked up as SPAM etc. by many third-party mail server providers. Beware however that ALL emails sent from the server regardless of setting any ‘from address’ or ‘from name’ will appear to come from your actual GMail address and name (Google forces this!) so I’d recommend using this for servers where you are the sole recipient of any emails such as automated administration emails, if you intend to send emails from a web application server to many public users I’d recommend either setting up a Postfix to send direct (and therefore ensuring that all DNS entries are configured correctly) or use a dedicated SMTP relay service like SendGrid or DNSExit’s Mail Relay Outbound Service. Anyway, lets get a move on…\nSo technically we will be installing and configuring Postfix as a ‘smarthost’, so first of all lets install Postfix on the server like so:-\napt-get install postfix\nNext, the deb-installer will prompt you for your desired Postfix configuration settings, these are the settings that you should use:-\n- Type of mail server: Satellite System\n- Mail name: example.org (the name you want for your outbound mail)\n- SMTP relay host: smtp.gmail.com\n- Postmaster: (You can leave this blank if you wish, this server will not be configured to receive emails)\n- Other destinations: (I’ve left this blank!) - Synchronous Queues: (Your choice, I left this as default, this won’t affect the relaying of emails)\n- Network blocks to allow relay: (Leave as default unless you want to allow all machines in your LAN etc to relay through this relay server, make sure you know what you are doing here though!) - Mailbox size: (Your choice, this is for incoming email only and therefore is not really important, I just left it as default!) - Local address: (I left it as default ‘+’)\n- Listen address: (Again, this is your choice, the default will do if you don’t want to segregate your network cards and access from other internal sub-domains, I therefore just left this as default also!) Fantastic, we are now nearly there! We now just need to make some changes tho the main Postfix configuration file located in \/etc\/postfix\/main.cf and add some extra configuration options to enable TLS and the Gmail account password required to send emails via. Gmail. So now, edit the file using Vi or Nano for example, like so:-\n…and now add the following lines to the bottom of this file:-\nsmtp_use_tls=yes smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:\/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous\nNow we create the username\/password authentication file, using Vi or Nano, create a new file here: \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd, the contents should be as follows:-\nYou obviously need to replace the above example with your own email address and ‘PASSWORD’ should be replaced with your current Gmail password. For best practice it is advisable that you change the ownership of the credentials files that you’ve just created and set restrictive permissions so that others with access to the server can not view the Gmail account credentials, lets do this now like so:\nchmod 640 \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd* chown postfix:postfix \/etc\/postfix\/sasl_passwd*\nNow we need to rebuild the hash, execute the following command:-\nNow finally, for the changes to take effect lets now restart Postfix so that emails can start being relayed:-\nservice postfix restart\nThat is it!",

There are several sites online that explain bits of how to do this, and Mike Chirico's is particularly good. I used his tutorial as a starting point, but I noticed I had to do a few things differently to get it working on my own system, so I'm documenting the differences. Disclaimer: Different about my setup is that I am using the Ubuntu packages, whereas Chirico's tutorial has you compile the packages yourself. There's nothing wrong with doing that, in fact, it's probably good for your soul, but I'd prefer to make use of the Ubuntu package manager as much as possible. Further, I'm not interested in using fetchmail, so I've done nothing with that. The first thing I did was install postfix. # apt-get install postfixI told the configuration script that I was installing for an internet site. Happily, debian\/ubuntu's postfix comes with TLS and SASL compiled in. Generate Your CertificatesIn order to connect to gmail, you need a certificate.

Getting out with your dog and enjoying the warm weather is the ultimate reward after being trapped inside all winter with a bored dog. From lake visits and dog friendly patios to hiking the Metroparks, if you have an active dog, you (and your dog) have no excuse to be bored during the summer months.\nIn addition to all of the outdoor activities you can do with your dog, local rescue groups host a number of fun dog friendly events throughout the summer. Here are the Top 5 Dog Friendly Events this summer you don’t want to miss:\nBring your dog along to watch you sip on some wine and tour the vineyards of Grand River Cellars in Madison. Held on June 13, Woof, Wag and Wine includes a tour of the winery, live music and auctions. Admission is $20 a person (which includes a Muddy Paws wine sampling) and proceeds go to the Lake Humane Society.\nAlthough the Indians aren’t doing their Puppypalooza event this year, you still have some opportunities to take your dog to a baseball game. Both the Lake Erie Captains and the Akron Rubber Ducks hold dog friendly nights. The Lake Erie Captains will hold their Bark at the Park on July 28, August 11 and August 23, and the Akron Rubber Ducks’ dog friendly games will be June 10 and August 19. A portion of the proceeds from each game will benefit local rescue groups.\nThe largest dog friendly event in Ohio, Canine Fun Days, is held every August at the Metroparks Polo Fields in Moreland Hills. This two day party for dogs and their people is organized by Greyhound Adoption of Ohio and includes swimming, dock diving, contests and more. This year’s event will be held August 16 and 17th.\nEvery Tuesday throughout the summer Tremont Taphouse hosts a dog friendly Yappy Hour to benefit local rescue groups. Bring your dog along for some patio time while you enjoy the Taphouse’s large selection of beer and delicious food. Adoptable dogs will also make appearances, so bring your dog-less friends along to meet their new best friend! Several other bars and wineries host Yappy Hours throughout the summer as well; check out my dog friendly events calendar for other upcoming dates.\nThis annual event, Dog Paddle and Pet-a-Palooza, is held at the Hinckley Reservation to benefit the Cleveland APL and the Medina County SPCA. Bring your dog to enjoy a swim at Ledge Pool as well as a mini dog fair including vendors and exhibitors. Also, dogs are allowed on rowboats at Hinckley Reservation, so if your dog doesn’t enjoy swimming you can rent a rowboat and take him for a boat ride instead.\nAnn McDonald is the writer behind the website Dogs in the CLE, the source for what to do with your dog in Cleveland. A lifelong dog lover, it took her until the age of 14 to finally convince her parents to get a dog (a crazy beagle named Daisy) and it’s been a love affair ever since.

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.\n\nDo you hate leaving your precious pooch behind when you go out for lunch?

The cheese board was delicious, the brussel sprouts, and the spicy shrimp flat bread were all marvelous. My only complaint is the price for alcoholic beverages. Their prices are too high, and make it nearly impossible to relax with a cocktail during your meal. We were floored when we were charged nearly $40 for a cheap bottle of chardonnay.

In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.\n\nPet-Centric Establishments Gaining Popularity Around The World\nGood news for foodies with pets, more and more animal-friendly establishments are opening across the U.S. From kitty teahouses to dog park bars, it seems drinking and dining with pets is the new trend for 2014. KitTea, San Francisco\nA new feline-concept teahouse is being planned for San Francisco by business partners Courtney Hatt and David Barginsky. The cat coffeeshop is still in the planning stages but hopes to create an atmosphere for cat lovers to come and enjoy an afternoon tea while in the company of kitties. In order to keep up with health code regulations, there will likely be separate spaces for food sales and kitty lounging. However, guests will be allowed, and encouraged, to take their food purchases into the cat zone. Hatt and Barginsky hope to even partner with local pet stores or rescue organizations to allow guests to take home animals with whom they felt they had a special connection. The Boneyard in Houston is a bar and dog park all in one. Unlike KitTea, where the animals will live in-house, Boneyard has a strict bring-your-own-dog policy. Patrons are encouraged to bring their furry friends to play in the more than 7,000 square feet of park space. Meanwhile, dog owners can enjoy a drink from the bar’s extensive beer and wine list. Pets Deli, Berlin\nThe Pets Deli in Berlin is a one-of-a-kind food market serving up gourmet pet food to animals with discerning taste. The menu at Pet Deli is split into Meat, Vegetables and Carbs, offering animal friends a complete and balanced nutritional meal. The good people at Pets Deli even offer desserts for those pets on their “cheat day.” All offerings are approved by an on-staff animal nutritionist and can be served in a metal bowl to stay or ordered to-go in a plastic box.\n\nEating out with your pup can be a fun experience, but not all restaurants are dog friendly. Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.\n\nPublished Jun 21, 2017\nWhether its your morning fix, an afternoon jolt or a late-night study session, what is your coffee shop? \"Super friendly service, excellent food and beverages.

If you’ve worried about bringing your pups with you when claiming your daily PintHub beer, worry no more. In honor of National Dog Day, we’ve compiled a list of dog-friendly PintHub venues (we narrowed it down since there were so many!) so that you can celebrate the right way today. Take a look at the best local venues on PintHub to explore this weekend, whether you’re in Austin, Dallas or the Fort Worth area—and if you want even more options, check out Dog Friendly Alliance’s website for a curated list of all the places you can bring your pups. Cheers! First on the list, is Austin Beerworks. Sitting on the north side of Austin, this local brewery comes equipped with a great outdoor area. Your pups will be very happy here—and so will you. If you haven’t tried their Peacemaker, an “anytime ale”, stay refreshed with that new pick. Just three minutes away from Austin Beerworks, you’ll find local gem, Adelbert’s Brewery. As soon as you load their Instagram page (@adelbertsbeer), you’ll find yourself looking at a great snap shot of a puppers on their patio. Your fur-child will definitely make new friends while you try a new beer. photo via @adelbertsbeer\nIf you’re really into trying something new, then this is the place for you. You can currently get a glass of their specially brewed creation, Discovery, a perfect name for the brew to catapult you into a new world of mead. Though dogs can’t go inside the taproom due to the brewing process, they are more than welcome out on the patio. With five options of beer to choose from on our PintHub app, Hi Sign is a great place to bring your pups. You can happily scroll through their Instagram to find the best doggos gracing your screen—and with hammocks and a great space, it’s no wonder dog owners love to bring their dogs there. This is also the perfect opportunity for you to snap a picture of your own pet and claim bragging rights on your own social media. photo via @hisignbrewing\nThe outdoor patio greets humans and pets alike. If you’re more into enjoying some food with your beer, Via 313 Pizza will serve as a great choice for you. Not only can pups help you with the pizza, but they can hang out with you outside—preferably once the sun starts to set in this heated summer. This venue is also going to have the most options for you to try, so good luck picking one! photo via @via313\nDon’t worry, DFW friends, we’ve got some places for you, too. Designed with a huge open floor plan, you can easily enjoy a brew in this dog-friendly taproom. There’s plenty of shade, so an afternoon trip won’t be terrible. Celebrate the day with a Sip-N-Go Pils or the Soul Pleasure stout. If you’re craving a view of downtown Ft. Worth, then this is the taproom for you. A view, your pups and a cold, lovingly-crafted beer—do you need anything else? Bring your pup out and enjoy the appropriate brew, Sweet Fang. photo via @pantherislandbrewing\nOne can never do wrong with a good can design. Admire the can you’re drinking from while you and your pups sit in an eclectic taproom in Dallas. An appropriate beer for the occasion? Off the Leash, a red ale that’s a solid six percent ABV. Since the venue does serve food, pets must be strictly confined to the patio. That doesn’t make them any less dog-friendly, though. Set up shop and relax while you celebrate the best day ever with your best friend. Just north of Dallas, in Farmer’s Branch, Texas, lies 3 Nations Brewing, a community taproom that loves having your dog around. Another great thing about them? PintHub and 3 Nations Brewing have over 10 beers for you to try at their location. Overwhelming? Try their American Wit or the Stone Wizard Double IPA. photo via @3nationsbrewing\nWhichever venue you choose, celebrate National Dog Day with your furry best friend with your “on the house” beer. Open up your PintHub app and start drinking!\n\nDogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?\n\nWelcome to this week’s installment of Ask the Critics. If you have a question you’d like answered in a future column, email us or leave the query in the comments. Today, we deal with a question that always comes up with the advent of warm weather:\nWhich restaurants will allow me to bring my dog? Technically, dogs aren’t allowed at restaurants, but some places will let you park Fluffy at your table in an outdoor seating section. Eateries with an enclosure around their sidewalk seating are likely to ask you to hitch your dog outside the railing, and then will seat you right next to it. Plus, some bars welcome dogs inside. At Pastis, your dog is welcome to sit outside the sidewalk barricade, and staff will bring a bowl of water if you ask. Similarly, Toby’s Public House, the excellent wood-oven pizza spot in Greenwood Heights, has a deck where your dog can sit right next to you, though outside the railing. The staff are very friendly about it, and will also bring water for the dog. Dog-friendly outdoor seating areas without enclosures are harder to find because, technically, they’re against code. Tabla is more hospitable than most, allowing pooches to sit with their owners in the outdoor cafe that overlooks Madison Square Park. And Pao, the comfortable Portuguese spot in the West Village, will let canines sit with you at the sidewalk tables. For a glass of wine in a relaxed atmosphere, check out Von, which welcomes dogs inside. For a big-ass cocktail at a fair price, head to Brooklyn’s Quarter Bar. If you get tipsy, your dog can walk you home. The dog-friendliness of these venues has all been recently verified, but it’s always a good idea to call before you go. You never know when a grouchy manager might be on duty. If you know of other good, dog-friendly eateries, let us know in the comments.\n\nQuestion:I enjoy having drinks with friends but hate leaving my dog at home.

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.",

Let Fido settle in for a nap under the table on the patio while you dig into one of Chipotle's fantastic burritos stuffed full of fresh ingredients.

            "passage": "Mankind’s infatuation with canine companionship is nothing new. In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.",

            "passage": "Pet-Centric Establishments Gaining Popularity Around The World\nGood news for foodies with pets, more and more animal-friendly establishments are opening across the U.S. From kitty teahouses to dog park bars, it seems drinking and dining with pets is the new trend for 2014. KitTea, San Francisco\nA new feline-concept teahouse is being planned for San Francisco by business partners Courtney Hatt and David Barginsky. The cat coffeeshop is still in the planning stages but hopes to create an atmosphere for cat lovers to come and enjoy an afternoon tea while in the company of kitties. In order to keep up with health code regulations, there will likely be separate spaces for food sales and kitty lounging. However, guests will be allowed, and encouraged, to take their food purchases into the cat zone. Hatt and Barginsky hope to even partner with local pet stores or rescue organizations to allow guests to take home animals with whom they felt they had a special connection. The Boneyard in Houston is a bar and dog park all in one. Unlike KitTea, where the animals will live in-house, Boneyard has a strict bring-your-own-dog policy. Patrons are encouraged to bring their furry friends to play in the more than 7,000 square feet of park space. Meanwhile, dog owners can enjoy a drink from the bar’s extensive beer and wine list. Pets Deli, Berlin\nThe Pets Deli in Berlin is a one-of-a-kind food market serving up gourmet pet food to animals with discerning taste.

You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.",

            "passage": "Drinking with friends is great, but drinking with your dog is even better. If you’ve worried about bringing your pups with you when claiming your daily PintHub beer, worry no more. In honor of National Dog Day, we’ve compiled a list of dog-friendly PintHub venues (we narrowed it down since there were so many!) so that you can celebrate the right way today. Take a look at the best local venues on PintHub to explore this weekend, whether you’re in Austin, Dallas or the Fort Worth area—and if you want even more options, check out Dog Friendly Alliance’s website for a curated list of all the places you can bring your pups. Cheers! First on the list, is Austin Beerworks. Sitting on the north side of Austin, this local brewery comes equipped with a great outdoor area. Your pups will be very happy here—and so will you. If you haven’t tried their Peacemaker, an “anytime ale”, stay refreshed with that new pick. Just three minutes away from Austin Beerworks, you’ll find local gem, Adelbert’s Brewery. As soon as you load their Instagram page (@adelbertsbeer), you’ll find yourself looking at a great snap shot of a puppers on their patio. Your fur-child will definitely make new friends while you try a new beer. photo via @adelbertsbeer\nIf you’re really into trying something new, then this is the place for you. You can currently get a glass of their specially brewed creation, Discovery, a perfect name for the brew to catapult you into a new world of mead. Though dogs can’t go inside the taproom due to the brewing process, they are more than welcome out on the patio. With five options of beer to choose from on our PintHub app, Hi Sign is a great place to bring your pups. You can happily scroll through their Instagram to find the best doggos gracing your screen—and with hammocks and a great space, it’s no wonder dog owners love to bring their dogs there. This is also the perfect opportunity for you to snap a picture of your own pet and claim bragging rights on your own social media. photo via @hisignbrewing\nThe outdoor patio greets humans and pets alike. If you’re more into enjoying some food with your beer, Via 313 Pizza will serve as a great choice for you. Not only can pups help you with the pizza, but they can hang out with you outside—preferably once the sun starts to set in this heated summer. This venue is also going to have the most options for you to try, so good luck picking one! photo via @via313\nDon’t worry, DFW friends, we’ve got some places for you, too. Designed with a huge open floor plan, you can easily enjoy a brew in this dog-friendly taproom. There’s plenty of shade, so an afternoon trip won’t be terrible. Celebrate the day with a Sip-N-Go Pils or the Soul Pleasure stout. If you’re craving a view of downtown Ft. Worth, then this is the taproom for you. A view, your pups and a cold, lovingly-crafted beer—do you need anything else? Bring your pup out and enjoy the appropriate brew, Sweet Fang. photo via @pantherislandbrewing\nOne can never do wrong with a good can design. Admire the can you’re drinking from while you and your pups sit in an eclectic taproom in Dallas. An appropriate beer for the occasion? Off the Leash, a red ale that’s a solid six percent ABV. Since the venue does serve food, pets must be strictly confined to the patio. That doesn’t make them any less dog-friendly, though. Set up shop and relax while you celebrate the best day ever with your best friend. Just north of Dallas, in Farmer’s Branch, Texas, lies 3 Nations Brewing, a community taproom that loves having your dog around. Another great thing about them? PintHub and 3 Nations Brewing have over 10 beers for you to try at their location. Overwhelming? Try their American Wit or the Stone Wizard Double IPA. photo via @3nationsbrewing\nWhichever venue you choose, celebrate National Dog Day with your furry best friend with your “on the house” beer. Open up your PintHub app and start drinking!",

            "passage": "Dogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?",

Today, we deal with a question that always comes up with the advent of warm weather:\nWhich restaurants will allow me to bring my dog? Technically, dogs aren’t allowed at restaurants, but some places will let you park Fluffy at your table in an outdoor seating section. Eateries with an enclosure around their sidewalk seating are likely to ask you to hitch your dog outside the railing, and then will seat you right next to it. Plus, some bars welcome dogs inside. At Pastis, your dog is welcome to sit outside the sidewalk barricade, and staff will bring a bowl of water if you ask. Similarly, Toby’s Public House, the excellent wood-oven pizza spot in Greenwood Heights, has a deck where your dog can sit right next to you, though outside the railing. The staff are very friendly about it, and will also bring water for the dog. Dog-friendly outdoor seating areas without enclosures are harder to find because, technically, they’re against code. Tabla is more hospitable than most, allowing pooches to sit with their owners in the outdoor cafe that overlooks Madison Square Park. And Pao, the comfortable Portuguese spot in the West Village, will let canines sit with you at the sidewalk tables. For a glass of wine in a relaxed atmosphere, check out Von, which welcomes dogs inside. For a big-ass cocktail at a fair price, head to Brooklyn’s Quarter Bar. If you get tipsy, your dog can walk you home. The dog-friendliness of these venues has all been recently verified, but it’s always a good idea to call before you go. You never know when a grouchy manager might be on duty. If you know of other good, dog-friendly eateries, let us know in the comments.",

    "text": "One of my favorite things about spring is the re-emergence of camping weather! Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!\nBut the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.\nAnd if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).\nSo, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!\n1. Pack LAYERS.\nThere is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n2. Anticipate darkness.\nThis may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.\n3. Pack sustainable food.\nWhen I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup\/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt\/pepper\/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs\/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!\n4. Embrace the gross\nDepending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!\n5. Anticipate problems\nKnock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:\n- Lots of water\n- Toilet paper\n- A good knife\n- A lighter or box of matches\n- First aid kit\n- A map and compass\n- Storm-proof outdoor gear\n- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)\n6. Bring some of the good stuff\nCamping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.\nAlways make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.\nDo you have any good camping tips to share?

One is in the mountains to survive in the simplest forms like the mountain men. Because that’s how Yeti is supposed to be. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore your personal hygiene too. Spending days in the wilderness on long treks like Roopkund Trek, Pin Parvati Pass with no bath can make you stink like a raccoon and make you feel all icky and lousy. Maintaining personal hygiene on the trek is as important as keeping yourself hydrated on the trek. Not only it keeps the diseases at bay but also helps you feel fresh and vigorous for a longer time. These things can feel a bit of a struggle with no proper sanitation facilities available on the trek as we are used to back in the comfort of our homes. Here is how you can carry out your personal hygiene manners on the trek without any fuss:\n1. Making your business\nDo not defecate where you eat. Even the dogs follow this simple rule. Then why not we humans. Keep these things in mind next to you attend nature's call in the woods. - Do not make a toilet tent or dig a hole near your camp. The defecation area should be at least 50 meters away from your tent and the water source. - Dig a 6-inch deep hole for your business. A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2. Changing clothes on the trek\nHow often should you change clothes on trek? If it is a long trek, it is wise option to rotate your clothes. Segregate your hiking clothes and camping clothes. After you reach the camping site, change into clean and dry clothing. Your sweaty clothes from hiking can end up giving you body rashes and bad odor. Sleeping with soiled clothes on in your sleeping bag can really make you uncomfortable. Plus, your sleeping will bag will start to stink too. Next day, when you resume trekking, you can change back into your trekking clothes. Avoid changing into a different pair of clothes in sub-zero temperatures on the treks like Bali Pass and Goecha La unless absolutely necessary. 3. How to take a dry bath\n“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess\nYou are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:\n- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air. It’s better you leave it at home. - Change your clothes in the daytime when the temperature is comparatively warm. Working up a sweat on the trek is always wow. But it will just be a matter of few days when the flies start meandering around you if ignore your personal hygiene. Not a pretty picture, right? Following these hygiene tips can save you from the humiliation.\n\nTable of Contents\nGood personal hygiene is one of the best ways to protect yourself from getting illnesses such as gastroenteritis and the common cold. Washing your hands with soap removes germs that can make you ill. Maintaining good personal hygiene will also help prevent you from spreading diseases to other people. What is personal hygiene? Personal hygiene includes:\n- cleaning your body every day\n- washing your hands with soap after going to the toilet\n- brushing your teeth twice a day\n- covering your mouth and nose with a tissue (or your sleeve) when sneezing or coughing\n- washing your hands after handling pets and other animals\nWhy is personal hygiene important? Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through touching other people, getting faeces (poo) on your hands, handling contaminated food and coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects. Conditions that you can develop if you have poor personal hygiene include:\nWashing your body\nTry to bath or shower each day. Wash well, especially under your armpits and around your genitals and anus. Keeping clean will prevent skin irritations and remove bacteria that cause body odour. Wash yourself with soap, shower gel or a hypoallergenic body wash. Soap removes more germs, but you may need to wash sensitive body parts with plain water or salt water. If there is no tap water or it is scarce, clean yourself with a clean wet cloth or sponge. Washing your hands\nTo avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly. - Wet your hands, then wash with soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds. Lather between the fingers and the back of your hands. - Clean grubby nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available. - Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water. - Dry off your hands with a clean towel or let them dry in the air. When to wash your hands\nIt is especially important to wash your hands after going to the toilet because faeces, which you might come into contact with, contains billions of germs. Also, wash your hands:\n- before and after eating or preparing food\n- after changing babies’ nappies\n- before and after touching a sick person or cleaning up vomit or body fluids\n- after blowing your nose\n- before and after treating cuts or wounds\n- after touching rubbish, dirty surfaces or objects\n- after handling pets or farm animals\nFind out more here about hand washing. Washing your genitals\nMen who are uncircumcised can clean their penis by gently pulling back the foreskin and washing underneath it with warm water or soap. See more here about penis care. Women can gently wash the delicate skin around the vulva with a soap-free wash, salt water or plain water. Avoid perfumed soap and bath products since these may irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Do not douche, because it upsets the healthy good bacteria in your vagina. During menstruation (your periods), wash your vulva as usual. Tampons can be changed every 3 to 4 hours. To avoid toxic shock syndrome, do not leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours. Change sanitary pads several times a day. Wash your hands before and after changing tampons or pads. Preventing body odour\nAfter washing, apply deodorant to your armpits. Put on clean, dry clothing. Wash sweaty or dirty garments well and, if possible, hang them outdoors to dry. If you have a problem with excessive sweating, make an appointment to see your doctor. Handling food safely\nWash your hands before and after preparing food. This will stop you contaminating food and will also protect you from getting ill or passing on bacteria from foodstuffs, such as raw meat. Find out more here about food safety. Preventing bad breath\nBad breath can be caused by poor oral hygiene. Brush and floss your teeth twice a day since this reduces gum disease and the chances of future tooth decay. Use these dental care tips and make an appointment with a dentist for a check-up if you have further symptoms.\n\nWARWICK, England, October 13, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --\n- Personal hygiene takes a back seat to staying in bed once winter sets in\nA study of 2,000 adults undertaken by Geberit AquaClean revealed major differences in personal hygiene routines in the winter vs summer, with many Brits (33%) halving the amount of time they spend in the bathroom during the colder weather from 30 minutes to just 15. It's not just less time that is spent on personal hygiene in winter, but less money too. The average monthly spend on personal hygiene products in the UK is £29.57, but 18% of Brits reduce their spending during the winter. Part of the reason for this seasonal difference is that we get less hot and sweaty during the winter months (57% cited this), but many Brits admit that it's simply too cold to shower so frequently in winter. In fact , 34% of us admit to bathing or showering less frequently in the winter, with a quarter of adults preferring to spend more time in bed as the cold dark mornings leave us feeling more tired. Meanwhile 2\/3 of women shave less their legs less frequently in the winter and 56% stated that their feet are neglected in the colder months. Raffaela De Vittorio, Marketing Director for Geberit AquaClean, which conducted the study, said: \"During the winter months many of us would rather grab some extra time under a warm duvet than in the bathroom, which is where the latest shower toilet technology really comes into its own.

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully\nShaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.\n\nPrepare yourself for the cold with these fleece lined thermal underwear for men! - Strong Moisture Wicking(Without the Sweaty Mess): Our fans say the unique breathable, moisture-wicking fibers on CL thermal underwear will wick away moisture to keep you dry with no sticky or clammy feeling so you can wear them all day for your work or snow adventure.

If this is your routine for maintaining personal hygiene, then it is high time you put more preparation and planning for your health and grooming. Neglecting your health and hygiene might result in various social and health problems that you might even not be aware of.

Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.\n\nWhat hygiene essentials should you include in your travel package? - Body Wash\n- Face Wash\n- Toothbrush and Toothpaste\n- Shampoo and Conditioner\n- Travel Bag\nWhen it comes to travelling it is best to have all the things you need for your trip all prepared and ready. From your travelling clothes, your travel documents, gadgets like your phone, camera, and laptop, to your body and skin care kit (with products coming from brands like Beyond Philippines). Remember that overall hygiene whilst you’re travelling all over the Philippines is important, which is why you have to be sure that you have all your essentials with you. With that in mind, here are some of the hygiene essentials that you must have in your travel package:\nYour own soap\nWhile most hotels and resorts would be able to provide you with most of the toiletries that you would need during your stay, the other places that you might be going to – especially the outdoors – will not be able to offer the same luxury. For this reason, it is best to make sure that you have a bar of soap or two while travelling. This would always come in handy, particularly when you’re going camping or to places with limited access to toiletries. Soap is one of the quickest and best ways to clean yourself up in any situation. Along with soap, having a small bottle of body wash could get you a long way in keeping you clean. Having this item would be a better way to clean you up more thoroughly after an exciting day going around. This would help you remove all that dirt, grime, and sweat you procured the entire day. Having some face wash would keep your face smooth and glowing during the day, and prevent it from getting oily as well as protect it from dirt. Bringing one around is not a hassle for your luggage as well, as you would only need a few sachets when travelling, and you would only need small drops of it to be effective. Make sure that you get some face wash that fits your skin health, as not all face washes would be able to provide the same type of care for different skin types. Another solid travel alternative would be face wipes, which provide you a quick way to clean your face on the go. Perhaps one of the most important things that you should never leave without when travelling – always have a toothbrush with you. Oral hygiene is very important, especially when you plan on having a food and drink adventure. There are many kinds of travel-ready toothbrushes available, which ensure that you have enough space for all of your other hygiene needs. Along with a toothbrush, make sure that you have some travel-sized toothpaste with you as well. There are toothpaste sachets and tablets to make sure that you would be able to travel light. Another oral hygiene essential, flossing after brushing your teeth is something that you should regularly do, even when you are travelling. Dental floss comes in portable packages that fit in your travel kit well, which means you won’t have to worry about space. Of course, you can’t forget about applying some deodorant after a good shower. Deodorant keeps different kinds of body odor in check and ensures that you are fresh and cool throughout your adventures. Solid deodorant is best for travelling, as it can withstand different kinds of weather, which makes it last longer. Deodorant comes in travel-friendly packages, which means you can bring a stick or two with no problem. Shampoo and Conditioner\nSince the weather can be constantly changing when you travel, it is advisable to take care of your hair in the best way with some good shampoo and conditioner. For summer destinations, it is best to get shampoo that keeps your hair cool during those warm days. Having conditioner would make sure that you would be able to keep your hair protected from the sun and healthy when you head out, which helps you keep yourself fresh. Every now and then, you would have to shave off some growing hair during your trip, especially if you are planning to travel for a few days. Make sure that you keep a razor in handy during your trips to keep yourself clean and fresh, and keep those unwanted hairs away. Of course, the most important thing that you need is the bag that would be able to carry all of the aforementioned items. Most travel bags would be able to carry around all of your hygiene needs listed above, and they won’t take up too much space in your luggage.\n\nQuestion:Is changing underwear daily considered particularly important for maintaining personal hygiene while camping without shower access?",

A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2.

How to take a dry bath\n“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess\nYou are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:\n- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air.

Washing your hands with soap removes germs that can make you ill. Maintaining good personal hygiene will also help prevent you from spreading diseases to other people. What is personal hygiene? Personal hygiene includes:\n- cleaning your body every day\n- washing your hands with soap after going to the toilet\n- brushing your teeth twice a day\n- covering your mouth and nose with a tissue (or your sleeve) when sneezing or coughing\n- washing your hands after handling pets and other animals\nWhy is personal hygiene important? Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through touching other people, getting faeces (poo) on your hands, handling contaminated food and coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects. Conditions that you can develop if you have poor personal hygiene include:\nWashing your body\nTry to bath or shower each day. Wash well, especially under your armpits and around your genitals and anus. Keeping clean will prevent skin irritations and remove bacteria that cause body odour. Wash yourself with soap, shower gel or a hypoallergenic body wash. Soap removes more germs, but you may need to wash sensitive body parts with plain water or salt water. If there is no tap water or it is scarce, clean yourself with a clean wet cloth or sponge. Washing your hands\nTo avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly. - Wet your hands, then wash with soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds. Lather between the fingers and the back of your hands. - Clean grubby nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available. - Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water. - Dry off your hands with a clean towel or let them dry in the air.

Women can gently wash the delicate skin around the vulva with a soap-free wash, salt water or plain water. Avoid perfumed soap and bath products since these may irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Do not douche, because it upsets the healthy good bacteria in your vagina. During menstruation (your periods), wash your vulva as usual. Tampons can be changed every 3 to 4 hours. To avoid toxic shock syndrome, do not leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours. Change sanitary pads several times a day. Wash your hands before and after changing tampons or pads. Preventing body odour\nAfter washing, apply deodorant to your armpits. Put on clean, dry clothing. Wash sweaty or dirty garments well and, if possible, hang them outdoors to dry. If you have a problem with excessive sweating, make an appointment to see your doctor. Handling food safely\nWash your hands before and after preparing food. This will stop you contaminating food and will also protect you from getting ill or passing on bacteria from foodstuffs, such as raw meat. Find out more here about food safety. Preventing bad breath\nBad breath can be caused by poor oral hygiene. Brush and floss your teeth twice a day since this reduces gum disease and the chances of future tooth decay.

It's not just less time that is spent on personal hygiene in winter, but less money too. The average monthly spend on personal hygiene products in the UK is £29.57, but 18% of Brits reduce their spending during the winter. Part of the reason for this seasonal difference is that we get less hot and sweaty during the winter months (57% cited this), but many Brits admit that it's simply too cold to shower so frequently in winter. In fact , 34% of us admit to bathing or showering less frequently in the winter, with a quarter of adults preferring to spend more time in bed as the cold dark mornings leave us feeling more tired. Meanwhile 2\/3 of women shave less their legs less frequently in the winter and 56% stated that their feet are neglected in the colder months. Raffaela De Vittorio, Marketing Director for Geberit AquaClean, which conducted the study, said: \"During the winter months many of us would rather grab some extra time under a warm duvet than in the bathroom, which is where the latest shower toilet technology really comes into its own. Gently cleaning you with warm water after each use, the Geberit AquaClean ensures healthy personal hygiene levels are maintained whatever the weather.\" While 15% of Brits would consider installing a shower toilet, currently just 6% of the survey's respondents use one, with the most popular way of cleaning after using the toilet being with wet wipes (40%), followed by showering (19%). However, taking a shower can be time consuming, particularly when compared to using a shower toilet. Despite people taking less time to clean themselves during the winter months, a staggering 10% of adults admit that they don't change their underwear every day, with 1% even owning up to doing so less than once a week! \"The research shows that despite the average Brit spending less time in the bathroom during the winter, their desire to feel fresh and clean is just as strong as in the summer and with so many people admitting to not changing their underwear regularly, a shower toilet ensures that personal hygiene levels are maintained no matter what the season is,\" adds Raffaela.

            "passage": "Why Feminine Hygiene Is So Important And What To Do About It\nLast updated on : August 13 2020\nSometimes We Are Too Busy For Personal Hygiene\nWomen have a lot of responsibilities in the household. Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully\nShaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.",

            "passage": "In 2007, the National Public Radio reported that not all Americans value cleanliness. Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.",

            "passage": "What hygiene essentials should you include in your travel package? - Body Wash\n- Face Wash\n- Toothbrush and Toothpaste\n- Shampoo and Conditioner\n- Travel Bag\nWhen it comes to travelling it is best to have all the things you need for your trip all prepared and ready. From your travelling clothes, your travel documents, gadgets like your phone, camera, and laptop, to your body and skin care kit (with products coming from brands like Beyond Philippines). Remember that overall hygiene whilst you’re travelling all over the Philippines is important, which is why you have to be sure that you have all your essentials with you. With that in mind, here are some of the hygiene essentials that you must have in your travel package:\nYour own soap\nWhile most hotels and resorts would be able to provide you with most of the toiletries that you would need during your stay, the other places that you might be going to – especially the outdoors – will not be able to offer the same luxury. For this reason, it is best to make sure that you have a bar of soap or two while travelling. This would always come in handy, particularly when you’re going camping or to places with limited access to toiletries. Soap is one of the quickest and best ways to clean yourself up in any situation. Along with soap, having a small bottle of body wash could get you a long way in keeping you clean. Having this item would be a better way to clean you up more thoroughly after an exciting day going around. This would help you remove all that dirt, grime, and sweat you procured the entire day. Having some face wash would keep your face smooth and glowing during the day, and prevent it from getting oily as well as protect it from dirt. Bringing one around is not a hassle for your luggage as well, as you would only need a few sachets when travelling, and you would only need small drops of it to be effective. Make sure that you get some face wash that fits your skin health, as not all face washes would be able to provide the same type of care for different skin types. Another solid travel alternative would be face wipes, which provide you a quick way to clean your face on the go. Perhaps one of the most important things that you should never leave without when travelling – always have a toothbrush with you. Oral hygiene is very important, especially when you plan on having a food and drink adventure. There are many kinds of travel-ready toothbrushes available, which ensure that you have enough space for all of your other hygiene needs. Along with a toothbrush, make sure that you have some travel-sized toothpaste with you as well. There are toothpaste sachets and tablets to make sure that you would be able to travel light. Another oral hygiene essential, flossing after brushing your teeth is something that you should regularly do, even when you are travelling. Dental floss comes in portable packages that fit in your travel kit well, which means you won’t have to worry about space. Of course, you can’t forget about applying some deodorant after a good shower. Deodorant keeps different kinds of body odor in check and ensures that you are fresh and cool throughout your adventures. Solid deodorant is best for travelling, as it can withstand different kinds of weather, which makes it last longer. Deodorant comes in travel-friendly packages, which means you can bring a stick or two with no problem. Shampoo and Conditioner\nSince the weather can be constantly changing when you travel, it is advisable to take care of your hair in the best way with some good shampoo and conditioner. For summer destinations, it is best to get shampoo that keeps your hair cool during those warm days. Having conditioner would make sure that you would be able to keep your hair protected from the sun and healthy when you head out, which helps you keep yourself fresh. Every now and then, you would have to shave off some growing hair during your trip, especially if you are planning to travel for a few days. Make sure that you keep a razor in handy during your trips to keep yourself clean and fresh, and keep those unwanted hairs away. Of course, the most important thing that you need is the bag that would be able to carry all of the aforementioned items. Most travel bags would be able to carry around all of your hygiene needs listed above, and they won’t take up too much space in your luggage.",

    "text": "We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.\nWhile you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.\nThe popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.\nThe first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?\nSecondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?\nAlso, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.\nOnce you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!\nThe forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.\nThe second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.\nSome group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.\nThe the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.\nThe performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.\nAdjourning or Mourning\nAt some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.\nImportant Note: This blog is intended for informational and discussion purposes only, and does not substitute for professional care.

Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.\n\nI then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.\n\nSuccessful people have very busy lives and to be blunt, they usually want to mastermind with people who are at or above the level they are at right now. That’s why the mix of a group like a group like this is so important. This Mastermind is a hand-picked, deliberately matched, very high level, for high achievers and limited to 6-12 members. I started with the people I wanted to mastermind with the most and then invited people that I think will be a perfect match for people I first put in the group because…\n- They are already operating at a very high level. - They will contribute in a powerful way to the group. - They will match the spirit and goals of the group. The investment to be in the group is $10,000 per year. Imagine 6 to 12 of the people YOU most want to work with in a group that meets in person three times a year for a day or two on an on-going basis with an online platform for maintaining those relationships in between the live events, plus an options 4th event just for fun. We will decide as a group exactly where to hold the events, how to schedule them and what format the events will take. I handpick people for this group one by one, because there’s a nagging desire in my brain to take things up a notch. - Higher level, not lower. - A longer time-frame, not less. - More commitment, not less. - Deeper involvement, not less. Okay, not exactly a marriage, but at least a year long-relationship. At the end of the year, we can decide if we want to extend it, but here’s the level of commitment. - One year commitment\n- 3 – “meet in person” 1 – 2 day masterminds\n- 6 – 12 people in the mastermind\n- All invested serious entrepreneurs who are hand-picked, for quality, positive generous spirit, clear synergy and high commitment level. I have a number of people committed to this group and if I told you who they were, you would be impressed. The bottom-line investment is $10,000 per year for the year’s commitment. There are only 12 spots maximum because any number over would be too big. We decide on dates as a group. In between the 3 live events we will maintain our relationships online and via webcasts. If you want to be considered for the group, you need to let me know now and we need to have a serious conversation to see if it’s a good match for you. Fill out the form below, if you are serious about being in this group.\n\nWe think the Concepts workshop is especially useful for people who are ready to engage deeply with EA ideas, but for whatever reason aren't a good fit for your intro fellowship or other intro program. We think the workshop is best with a small number of participants - maybe between 6 and 12. But, if you wanted to run it with a larger group, you could do so with some small adjustments. Our resources pack includes:\n- Slides (with speaker notes)\n- Organiser guide\n- Feedback form\n\nThey allow for growth (when two friends of the current Cubs want to join up along the way), they’re manageable for most DLs (including those with ADLs), and they’re also manageable for Boy Scouts who come aboard as Den Chiefs! Six is a near-perfect number for outings (three “buddy-pairs”), and for handling advancement activities in den meetings. I’ve had lots of experience with DLs who want to have “super-dens” of ten, twelve, and even more…they all invariably fail because when one or two don’t show up the DL is actually thankful, a group of a dozen or more boys will automatically divide themselves into at least two smaller groups anyway, and outings become totally unwieldy. What typically happens is that a beginning den of a dozen (or thereabouts) Wolf Cubs dwindles over the next several years (boys can’t get the personal attention they need and any “troubled” or “shy” ones drop out or get lost in the shuffle anyway), and that den is lucky if it graduates four or five remaining into a Boy Scout troop. The key is to “force” no one! Simply ask the Cubs themselves to form groups of between 5 and 7, by age\/grade, with no one left out. They can do this pretty much by themselves, with a bit of “over-watching” (and sometimes guiding–but with feathers, not baseball bats!). As for “closing” dens to new members…that’s just not part of the objectives of Scouting. We’re here to be INclusive, not EXclusive. That’s why a den of six is a very nice number…and even five can work well! At five or six, the “bonding” is a thing of beauty! Double that number and instead of bonding it becomes an exercise in greased pig wrangling. You, as Cubmaster, and your Committee Chair, need to be united on this: You’ll need the Buddy System yourselves to deal with the renegades that want to form “mini-packs” inside the pack itself! Support one another, don’t cave in, and never make exceptions! But do this all with smiles–all the time! PS, once you’re set up, be sure ALL of you go to training at the same time – After all, you all need some bonding, too! Have a question? Facing a dilemma?

But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups. Resists the temptation to coordinate everything in a big, clarifying conversation.\n\nDifference between revisions of \"TeamUp\"\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n|Line 148:||Line 148:|\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\nNote that, depending on student responses, it may happen that no group composition is perfectly optimal.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.\n\nIt’s my second week in NY and I sat in on Tom Igoe’s class on Understanding Networks. I’ll do some comparisons between his class and a typical undergraduate class I took, when I was in college. The first thing is the class size, 16 students at ITP compared to 48 students at IOE (Institute of Engineering). I was wondering how ITP came up with the number 16, did they experiment with smaller or larger groups and settled for 16 to be the optimal number. I should probably ask this the next time I run into any faculty members. The second thing is the classroom arrangement, the students at ITP sit around tables arranged in the middle of the room, facing each other. At IOE, we’d sit on benches that were arranged in rows all facing the teacher and the energy flow would be from the teacher to the student. The energy flow in the class at ITP is more organic and involves everyone in the class, not just the teacher.\n\nI’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.\n\nGroups are extremely buzzword compliant. You get active engagement, collaboration, and become a facilitator all in one move. Well, provided you are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes and have enough tasks to fill the time. I hypothosized about it previously, and now I think I have a good plan. It could all explode in my face and I'll have to retool, but here's how it's going to work. Week 1 and 2 are Boot Camp. This year I have Pre-Cal and Algebra II, so they're both getting it. Algebra II will be a little modified and approached differently. Several of the topics covered fit in nicely with the first few sections, others should probably wait until later, and the degree of difficulty will need to be adjusted. After Boot Camp, the class will be split into groups. Class sizes indicate that 6 groups of 5 is the way to go for me. Desk arrangement is the fun part of that one. Desks are labeled 1-5, each group is a color. I will change the groups every so often, probably at grading period end. Big picture class format:\n- Instead of homework, a task will be given to each student when we start new topics\n- The task will cover all items ahead of us with a large problem set, sourced from a textbook to save time\n- Each group member must complete the task prior to a test, the task serves double duty as the review\n- The task will cover problems that require more than one mind to figure out\n- Those harder task problems will be intended for class discussion\n- How and when the students complete the task is up to them, there will be some time in class for this purpose\n- Tasks are pasted into a notebook, no task is accepted outside of a notebook\n- Each student will keep a notebook where all tasks, warm ups, examples, \"now you try\", WCYDWT questions live\n- Students will be assessed on the topics of the week frequently\nThis format will reign most of the time unless I have something special in mind. Calculators and voting devices will be kept in the vicinity of the group rather than in a central location to minimize foot traffic and readiness time. Grading expectations are as follows:\nHow I determine that 10% Group portion is still being worked out. Part of it should include assessment from the group members to add a little fear that your teammates will flunk you if you're a punk. Notebooks are collected\/inspected prior to reporting periods and must have whatever tasks I feel should have been completed by then. Algebra II will be tested in a Standards Based format, so it is expected that they'll have all their test scores recorded as well. In the future, possibly second semester, I hope to find a way to award groups points as we go along, similar to what they do on Around the Horn (an ESPN show, sportswriters are voted up\/down by the host based on what they say and eventually one writer \"wins\"). College gave me the idea for a single, large, weekly assignment and group member evaluation, and the whole concept from my 6th grade math teacher.

            "passage": "We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.",

            "passage": "I then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.",

Six is a near-perfect number for outings (three “buddy-pairs”), and for handling advancement activities in den meetings. I’ve had lots of experience with DLs who want to have “super-dens” of ten, twelve, and even more…they all invariably fail because when one or two don’t show up the DL is actually thankful, a group of a dozen or more boys will automatically divide themselves into at least two smaller groups anyway, and outings become totally unwieldy. What typically happens is that a beginning den of a dozen (or thereabouts) Wolf Cubs dwindles over the next several years (boys can’t get the personal attention they need and any “troubled” or “shy” ones drop out or get lost in the shuffle anyway), and that den is lucky if it graduates four or five remaining into a Boy Scout troop. The key is to “force” no one! Simply ask the Cubs themselves to form groups of between 5 and 7, by age\/grade, with no one left out. They can do this pretty much by themselves, with a bit of “over-watching” (and sometimes guiding–but with feathers, not baseball bats!).

But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.",

The first thing is the class size, 16 students at ITP compared to 48 students at IOE (Institute of Engineering). I was wondering how ITP came up with the number 16, did they experiment with smaller or larger groups and settled for 16 to be the optimal number. I should probably ask this the next time I run into any faculty members. The second thing is the classroom arrangement, the students at ITP sit around tables arranged in the middle of the room, facing each other. At IOE, we’d sit on benches that were arranged in rows all facing the teacher and the energy flow would be from the teacher to the student.

            "passage": "I’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.",

Well, provided you are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes and have enough tasks to fill the time. I hypothosized about it previously, and now I think I have a good plan. It could all explode in my face and I'll have to retool, but here's how it's going to work. Week 1 and 2 are Boot Camp. This year I have Pre-Cal and Algebra II, so they're both getting it. Algebra II will be a little modified and approached differently. Several of the topics covered fit in nicely with the first few sections, others should probably wait until later, and the degree of difficulty will need to be adjusted. After Boot Camp, the class will be split into groups. Class sizes indicate that 6 groups of 5 is the way to go for me. Desk arrangement is the fun part of that one. Desks are labeled 1-5, each group is a color. I will change the groups every so often, probably at grading period end. Big picture class format:\n- Instead of homework, a task will be given to each student when we start new topics\n- The task will cover all items ahead of us with a large problem set, sourced from a textbook to save time\n- Each group member must complete the task prior to a test, the task serves double duty as the review\n- The task will cover problems that require more than one mind to figure out\n- Those harder task problems will be intended for class discussion\n- How and when the students complete the task is up to them, there will be some time in class for this purpose\n- Tasks are pasted into a notebook, no task is accepted outside of a notebook\n- Each student will keep a notebook where all tasks, warm ups, examples, \"now you try\", WCYDWT questions live\n- Students will be assessed on the topics of the week frequently\nThis format will reign most of the time unless I have something special in mind. Calculators and voting devices will be kept in the vicinity of the group rather than in a central location to minimize foot traffic and readiness time. Grading expectations are as follows:\nHow I determine that 10% Group portion is still being worked out. Part of it should include assessment from the group members to add a little fear that your teammates will flunk you if you're a punk. Notebooks are collected\/inspected prior to reporting periods and must have whatever tasks I feel should have been completed by then. Algebra II will be tested in a Standards Based format, so it is expected that they'll have all their test scores recorded as well. In the future, possibly second semester, I hope to find a way to award groups points as we go along, similar to what they do on Around the Horn (an ESPN show, sportswriters are voted up\/down by the host based on what they say and eventually one writer \"wins\"). College gave me the idea for a single, large, weekly assignment and group member evaluation, and the whole concept from my 6th grade math teacher. Lastly, randomizing and rotating is a big part of active engagement, and what does any mega nerd with an engineering degree do to address this? Popsicle sticks, right? No! Call an amazing programmer friend of yours and make an app for that (features pending):",

If you have not received the products or services you ordered, contact the company and ask for a refund.Customers may request a refund of money paid for products or services purchased or used on your website or app in certain circumstances.

Kindly align the Refund policy to be in line with the products and services available on the website and include the number of days taken to process the refund and credit the amount to the customer’s bank account within 7-10 working days.\n\nReturning your purchase\nFor physical prepackaged products returned in resalable condition and sealed in their original packaging, we will honor a full refund within 30 days, less shipping. For non-resalable products that are defective, we will honor a full refund less shipping. Due to the personal and\/or custom nature of our fine products, open-package products (garments) are non-refundable\/non-returnable. Likewise, consumable products (such as yarns) that have been partially used are non-returnable\/non-refundable. Receiving a refund\nReturns that are eligible for refund will be refunded via the same payment method used for the original purchase.\n\nUnder what circumstances are returns accepted? How long do I have to request a return? How long do I have to return my purchase? Customers have 30 days from the date of purchase for the item to be received at the warehouse. How do I initiate a return? What are my options after the item is received back at the warehouse? Refunds can only be credited back to the payment method used for the initial purchase.\n\nRefunds are returned using the original method of payment. If payment was made by credit card, your refund will be credited to that same credit card. Please contact us to discuss any necessary return or refund. Orders are shipped by UPS, FedEx, USPS, or private courier. We will alert you to the planned shipping method and timeframe. If a tracking number is provided by the shipping carrier, we will update your order with the tracking information.\n\nWhere Is The Money Paid To? As mentioned in the Moto360 Return and Refund document, all refunds will be made through the channel used at the initial purchase. For example, if you used a credit card or Paypal account, the payment will be made to that card or wallet (as the case may be). When Can I Expect My Refund? eBuyNow initiates the refund process as soon as the product is cleared for return. However, the credit card companies usually take about 3-5 working days to process the payment. PayPal transactions are typically completed faster, compared to the credit card option. Paypal users will receive an email immediately after the payment enters their account.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nEcosa accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal. Please note that there are no surcharges for any transactions. You can get 6 months interest-free by simply selecting the Zip payment option during checkout.

Upon approval, your refund will be processed and funds will be returned to the original payment method used to make your purchase. Please note: PayPal, Afterpay and Zip Pay refunds can only be processed via the original payment account. If you have closed your PayPal, Afterpay or Zip Pay account since your purchase, you must reactivate the account to obtain your funds. Ecosa is unable to process refunds to any other source on orders made with a third party payment platform.\n\nWhen you return an item purchased online, we are committed to refund you the purchase price as soon as possible. This will never be later than 14 days from the day on which we receive the returned item(s) and verified that they comply with our Return Policy. The refund will include the cost of the returned goods, and in the case of a full return (when you return all items belonging to the same purchase), you will also the receive back the (outbound) shipping charges (based on the least expensive type of delivery offered by us). If you return only part of the item\/s belonging to the same purchase, the shipping charges will not be refunded. |Purchased at:||Return at:||Refund method:|\n|Purchased in Store||Returned in Store||Gift Card or Exchange|\n|Purchased Online\/SF||Return in Store||Cash\/Original Payment\/Exchange|\nThe refund will be issued to the same payment method used for the order, with the following two exceptions:\n- When returning an item in one of our Sidestep stores, the refund will be made in cash (unless the original payment was made by credit or debit card). - If the order was paid by cash on delivery (Netherlands only) the refund will be made by bank transfer to a valid bank account to be provided by you. To speed things up, once you've handed your parcel to UPS, please contact our Customer Care team and provide your billing address, IBAN and BIC. All prices at the point of sale are final, and therefore we don't offer refunds on price differences. How long it will take to receive my refund? Usually, not long! Refunds generally take 3-10 working days to show up on your bank account from the day you receive a Refund Confirmation email from us. The speed entirely depends on your bank or payment provider: some banks are quicker than others. I haven't received my refund yet\nIf after 10 working days you still haven’t received your refund, please contact your bank and our Customer Care team. Please note that if you paid using PayPal or Clearpay, the refund will be issued back to your account and not directly to the card associated with said account. How soon will I be refunded after canceling an order? If there is something wrong with your refund, please contact our Customer Care team. In the first instance, please contact Paypal. You can find more information on their Buyer Protection Resolution page. If you have already contacted Paypal and are looking for an updated status from Sidestep's end, please contact us. Yes, you can! Just take the item(s) you wish to return to your nearest store along with the order invoice. Our staff will be happy to assist you. Although, we recommend that you return your item(s) from where they were originally purchased. If you're nearing the end of the 28-day return period, then we advise to return the item(s) to us via UPS instead. The refund for items returned in store will be made in cash, unless the original payment was made by credit or debit card. To help avoid any issues, we recommend returning your item(s) during the afternoon hours when there is already enough cash in the store’s register to process your refund.\n\nHowever, if the product is returned for another reason (the customer does not like the products even though they have been delivered correctly), the customer will be responsible for the shipping costs incurred in returning the order. The company will inform the customer of the address to which the product should be sent and may use the courier service of its choice. In any case, the customer must provide the company with information about the returned products (chosen courier company, date, time, etc.). I have returned the order. When will I receive my refund? A refund will be paid for the same amount that was paid for the returned products minus the cost of the return service. Only when the products delivered are defective or incorrect, the company will reimburse the costs incurred in their return. Partial refunds will be paid for returns and partial cancellations of products. The company will process the return order by the same system as the one used for payment within 8 days of confirmation that the returned order has arrived at the warehouse. The refund will be credited to the customer’s account depending on the issuing institution.\n\nConfirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account.

You further acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and\/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer. In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then WebBase Store, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund either (i) in the form of an in-store credit; or (ii) via issuance of a WebBase Store check, which will be sent to the mailing address on file for your Account. WebBase Store also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method.

    "answer": "Yes, in Iowa, there is a financial penalty for not showing up to a scheduled OWI (Operating While Intoxicated) class. If a participant in an OWI class does not attend without providing a valid reason or notification, they may be charged a cancellation fee and may also have to pay for the entire class. Additionally, failing to complete the OWI class may result in a license suspension or other legal consequences.

In both classes, they came to realize that any punishment would result in even more of my time being wasted. Also, we discussed how taking points off (2nd class's idea) doesn't go along with my s-b grading at all. In both classes, we discussed how it all comes down to effort and responsibility. I told them that my brother, a high school math teacher (Matt Townsley), questioned if 6th graders were really responsible\/capable enough to handle the retakes system. Both classes said they were. They said if people are showing up, it shows that anyone can be capable of showing up. I ended the conversation with saying that I hope the next time they sign up for a retake, they keep this conversation in mind. Even though the 2nd class said posting a schedule would take up my time, I still might consider doing it to see if it helps at all. But, if they write it down in their planners and don't look at those, will they look at a schedule?\n\nFirst Priority Enrollment: contractor\/dispatcher\/business agent referrals for members that meet second priority eligibility requirements or members that haven’t taken training in last 2 years that meet second priority eligibility requirements.

An SR22 form is a voucher that an insurance company must submit to the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT). The form proves the driver has auto insurance as well as how much and when the policy was enacted. Not all drivers need SR22, and the IDOT outlines the guidelines under which it may be required. In most cases, an SR22 form is required to reinstate driving privileges due to license suspension. Described below is essential information on SR22 insurance and how it impacts your driving privileges. What is Iowa SR22 insurance? Insurance companies charge Iowa SR-22 rates to drivers who are required by law to obtain it as a part of their auto policy. As a policy add-on rather than a policy itself, an SR22 form demonstrates to the Iowa Department of Transportation that a driver has sufficient liability coverage as required by state law. The form contains information about the amount of liability coverage, the policy start date and whether or not the policy is active. A driver may not drop SR22 insurance without prior notice to the IDOT, as doing so could result in additional penalties and fines. Who needs SR22 insurance in Iowa? Most drivers do not need Iowa SR22 insurance, as the IDOT bases the requirement on traffic-related offenses. The IDOT determines who needs SR22 insurance forms and provides that driver with all the information about the requirement. According to the Iowa drivers manual, the IDOT requires the insurance for a variety of reasons, with the most common being:\n- Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) citation for a blood alcohol level .08 or higher. - Committing a vehicle offense that is punishable by a felony conviction such as vehicular manslaughter\n- Suspension due to out-of-state convictions\nDrivers questioning who needs SR22 insurance should consult the driver’s manual or speak with a member of IDOT staff for more information. In general, the state notifies drivers if they will need to purchase the insurance. The state also provides information on any necessary fees and the steps required to restore their driving privileges after a driver’s license suspension. Reinstating Driving Privileges With SR22 in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance cease once the driver has completed all requirements to restore their driving privileges. Once a driver is eligible to remove SR22 from their coverage, he or she must present what the state refers to as proof of future financial responsibility. In essence, motorists must prove to the IDOT that they have appropriate coverage in place to meet financial obligations for future driving incidents. Further, drivers must pay all applicable fees to reinstate their privileges. License and registration privileges apply to the vehicles for which motorists have provided proof of insurance. Thus, drivers must show proof of insurance for any vehicle registered in their name to cover all relevant cars. Drivers who are required to purchase SR22 insurance may qualify for a Temporary Restricted License (TRL). With a TRL, motorists may receive limited driving privileges to operate their vehicle for approved circumstances. Acceptable reasons for a TRL include driving to work, school or medical appointments. How to Get SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nIn Iowa, SR-22 rates are not set by the Department of Transportation. Insurance companies offer SR22 insurance quotes and provide the necessary coverage. Given that drivers who require this particular coverage are known for severe or repeated traffic-related incidents, many insurers do not offer the coverage. Those that do may charge a premium for the added feature to offset the potential financial risk for these drivers. As such, motorists should contact multiple companies for quotes. Some insurance companies offer SR-22 coverage as a rider to an existing policy. In some cases, they may require drivers to purchase an SR22 policy that contains the necessary coverage. Drivers who have questions on the specific amount of coverage needed should contact the IDOT for more information. How to File SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nAn Iowa SR22 form may only be submitted by an insurance company. The Department of Transportation does not accept SR22 forms from drivers, and motorists should request their insurer to file it on their behalf. Once submitted, the insurance company is required to update the Department of Transportation of any status changes on the policy. Should a driver cancel the SR22 policy, the insurer must notify the IDOT immediately.\n\nIn all such cases, students must inform their instructors (and the Financial Aid Office, if appropriate) prior to their absence, when possible, and provide appropriate documentation. Each semester, students’ class schedules become official upon payment of required fees (either by the student or by award of financial aid). Students who drop a class during the drop\/add period (on or before the third day of the semester for a full semester class, or on or before the second day of the term for a term C class) will be removed from the class roll, and the course will not show on the student’s academic record. A 100 percent refund is issued for classes dropped during the drop\/add period of the term. Thereafter, students may officially withdraw from a course without academic penalty by the designated withdrawal date for the semester and receive a “W” grade for the course. The “W” grade is not computed in the student’s grade point average, but does count in terms of financial aid eligibility. To officially withdraw from a course, students can withdraw online or meet with an Enrollment Advisor in the Enrollment Support Center to fill out the appropriate forms. Students who must withdraw from all classes will have to do so in person at the Enrollment Support Center. There is no refund for classes withdrawn after the drop\/add period of the term. Students who withdraw after the designated withdrawal date for the semester will receive a “WF” grade, unless a “W” grade is approved by the Academic Affairs Office through the appeal process for hardship withdrawal. Students must follow the withdrawal procedure as described in the paragraph above. A “WF” grade is computed in the student’s grade point average as a failing grade and counts toward the student’s financial aid eligibility. If you are awarded financial aid, please refer to the Return to Tile IV Financial Aid Withdrawal Policy section of the catalog to determine the impact withdrawing from courses may have on your financial aid. Hardship Withdrawal Appeal\nStudents have the right to appeal for a Hardship Withdrawal with the Academic Affairs Office. Consideration of a Hardship Withdrawal is limited to certain criteria which may include, but is not limited to: hospitalization of the student, the death of an immediate family member during the semester of the withdrawal, the student being assigned to active military duty or jury duty for more than three consecutive days during the term. The student must have withdrawn from, or failed, all courses in the affected term for the appeal to be considered. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Academic Affairs Office no later than one week into the following term. All decisions on appeals of hardship withdrawals rendered by the Academic Affairs Office shall be final. Students who do not participate or attend in the first week of classes will be designated as “No Show” and will be removed from the class roster. Online students who do not participate during the first week of the term will be dropped as a “No Show.” For hybrid courses that meet once per week, students must attend or participate online during the first week to avoid “No Show” designation. For web-enhanced courses, students must attend during the first week to avoid “No Show” designation. When submitted as a “No Show”, the course will not appear on the student’s academic record and a 100 percent refund of applicable tuition and applicable refundable fees will be given. Financial aid students will be responsible for all charges related to any classes for which they are designated as “No Show”. Financial aid will not pay for “No-Show” classes. It is the student’s responsibility to confirm his\/her registration status for each course during the registration and drop\/add periods. The responsibility to register for classes and drop those classes that are no longer desired to be taken resides solely with the student. Classes in which students no longer desire to participate should be dropped during registration or the drop\/add period. The “No Show” process is the college’s administrative recordkeeping process and students should not attempt to use or rely on this process to ensure classes are removed from their schedules. A tardy will be recorded when a student arrives 1 to 10 minutes late for a class. When a student is tardy more than 10 minutes of a class hour, an absence will be recorded for one class period. Course syllabi identify those competencies that should be demonstrated by students in order to successfully complete a course. Course syllabi may also identify certain competencies as critical.\n\nTo ensure the commitment to student success, attendance must be taken in all classes, regardless of modality, starting with the first day of the class. - Faculty may elect to relate course attendance to the course grading policy. This will be specified in each course syllabus. - For federal financial aid compliance, attendance will be recorded by the faculty and reported to the College Registrar’s Office. - A student is considered a non-attendee in any course modality when he or she does not physically attend a class session or does not log in and participate in the course content within the first 14 days of the term for fall and spring (excluding holidays and emergency closings) and within the first 7 days of the term (excluding holidays and emergency closings) for accelerated terms as per the Federal Financial Aid Guidelines. - Students who receive federal financial aid and do not physically attend or log in to classes will be dropped from their classes and have their financial aid cancelled or reduced. The federal government mandates that federal monies for non-attendees who receive federal financial aid be returned to the federal government. - Attendance will also be documented at the end of each semester to verify last day attended in each class.\n\nAppointment cancellation and no show policy\nAt CCPD, we work one on one to help students with their individual career planning needs. Please respect the time of a coach - as well as other students , we ask that you please make every effort to keep your scheduled time with a coach. We understand your schedule may change but please inform your coach in a timely manner. The following outlines the steps to take as well as our cancellation and no show policy. Cancellations: Students may cancel their scheduled appointment up to 24 hours prior to the appointment day by either calling the CCPD (610-758-3710) or emailing their career coach. Late Cancellation: An appointment cancelled within the 24-hour period before the appointment is considered a Late Cancellation. No-Show: A No-Show is when a student fails to show for their scheduled appointment time. Consequence: A Late Cancellation or No-Show will automatically result in following actions being taken:\n- First Offense: If you do not show or do not cancel your appointment within 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment you will receive an e-mail reminder about the Cancellation\/No-Show policy\n- Second Offense: You will receive an e-mail from the career coach alerting you that if you don't keep your 3rd appointment, you will not be allowed to schedule an individual appointment for the remainder of the semester, but will still have access to use Career Lab hours. - Third Offense: You will receive an e-mail notice that your privilege for scheduling an appointment is suspended for the remainder of the semester and that you may only use Career Lab during this time period. Late arrival for appointment policy:\nThe time allotted for your appointment is to ensure there is sufficient time to assist with your career needs. Arriving more than 15 minutes late for an appointment without calling to notify CCPD, may result in the appointment being forfeited and may be counted as No-Show.\n\nYou don’t have to go for 3s, a 2 is enough, but I want some way to signal to people that I noticed if you seem especially involved. Question: My friend said you have to do longer comments for this class, but I don’t see anything about that. What am I supposed to do? Answer: The class assignments have changed since the last time I taught the class. Read the syllabus for this term. There is one ungraded essay due to your TA in section on September 7 in which you write about your own ethnic\/racial background and experiences. 1-2 pages. Toward the end of the term you will write 150 minutes on an assignment that will be distributed in the second half of the class. Missed Class, Late Comments, Make Ups\nQuestion: What if I am sick? Answer: DO NOT come to class if you are sick. Do a make up. You will not be penalized, but you must do the make up to get credit for the missed class. (see below) Your claims of illness will generally be taken at face value, however it is academic misconduct to claim to be ill when you are not. “I need a mental health day” is not an illness. A communicable disease or a physical condition that makes it impossible to come to class is what is meant here. If you miss more than two or three classes due to illness, we will require more information. Question: What if I miss class for a religious holiday? Or because my child\/parent is ill? Or because I am in a car crash? Answer: If you miss class due to circumstances beyond your control (or a religious observance), do a make up. You will not be penalized, but you must do the make up to get credit for the class. (see below) Your claims of circumstances beyond your control will generally be taken at face value, however it is academic misconduct to lie about such circumstances and if you are claiming more than a day or two, we may ask for additional documentation. Question: How do I do a lecture make-up? Answer: (1) Talk to at least 4 different students to make sure you know what actually happened in the class you missed. Do not make assumptions. Sometimes the web site has not been updated. (2) Spend a minimum of 30 minutes doing reading, talking in some depth to 4 or more people from the class, or watching videos to find out what you missed, Then write (a) why you missed class (needed only if the absence should be excused) (b) what you did to make up the class (what you read, who you talked to) and (c) a minimum of 200 words describing what happened in the class that you missed. You still have to do a make-up even if the absence is excused due to illness, religious observance, or circumstances beyond your control. If your absence should be “excused” for illness or other reason, you need to give the reason in the make-up entry. We will ask for documentation of the circumstances if you are claiming a large number of excused absences. Question: I really need to study for my chemistry exam \/ got called into work \/ had a job interview \/ just didn’t feel like coming to class. Can I get credit? Answer: You can get credit for up to two voluntary (i.e. unexcused) absences by doing a lecture make up. You can get half credit for a make up for two more voluntary absences. Beyond that, you cannot get credit for missed classes. Please note: studying for another class, going to a special review session, taking two classes that overlap with each other, having job hours that conflict with class, having a job interview or taking a vacation do NOT count as circumstances beyond your control. While you sometimes have to make difficult choices, they are your choices. If you do have to take the point loss, it will not be great unless you miss a lot of classes. Question: What if I forgot to turn in my lecture comment when I left class? Can I email it to you? Or drop it off at your office? Will I still get credit if it is late? Answer: Do NOT email to me, do NOT drop it off anywhere, do NOT give it to your TA. The ONLY way I accept any lecture comments is in the folders. If you forget to turn it in, submit it to the folder at the next class with a note on it saying what happened. If this is a rare event, your explanation will be believed. If it happens often, you will need to do something to correct the problem or lose credit. Question: I had to come late\/leave early. Can I still get credit for the class?\n\n2. All undergraduates are expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. In the case of hybrid and fully online classes, participation in discussion forums and other required online activities is expected. 3. Attendance, by itself, shall not constitute a basis for grading except for certain clearly designated courses. These courses include, but are not limited to, all Physics and Mathematics 100 and 200 level courses in which a student missing more than three classes may be required to withdraw. 4. Students who expect to miss classes or exams because of religious observance must submit to their instructors, by the end of the second week of classes, a written list of dates that will be missed. Students are expected to make up missed work. Faculty are expected to make reasonable attempts to accommodate students who are appropriately following this policy. 5. Instructors are obligated to explain clearly, on all syllabi to be distributed at the beginning of each semester, what is expected of students in terms of activities such as class participation, reading assignments, and reports and how these activities factor into student grades. 6. Instructors are not obligated to make allowances for student absences unless those absences are due to illness or similarly unavoidable causes. 7. When, in the opinion of the instructor, a student is jeopardizing the successful completion of the academic requirements of a subject due to excessive absences, the instructor will initiate an absence warning (Academic Warning Notice), which is to be sent to the student by the instructor. 8. It is understood that this policy on attendance is intended to reinforce students’ personal responsibility to be present in class in order to:\na) Gain mastery of the subject matter, ideas, and techniques developed in the course. b) Take examinations, tests and quizzes. c) Participate in oral presentations, seminars, and field trips. d) Participate in group activities such as laboratory experiments and study projects\ne) Remain fully informed as to class plans, announcements, and assignments.\n\nStudents who are unable to attend the first meeting of a class or laboratory for which they are registered should notify the instructor or department chair prior to the first meeting of the class or laboratory. If a notification of the student’s intent is not received, the instructor, at his or her discretion, may cancel the student’s registration if space is needed in the course. Ultimately it is the students' responsibility to officially drop any course they don't plan on attending before the drop deadline. Students who plan to discontinue a course after the drop deadline must officially withdraw from the course before the withdrawal deadline (see Withdrawal Policy). Note that if a student who has been awarded a federal loan and\/or grant does not officially withdraw and fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course over an entire semester, the institution must assume, for Title IV purposes, that the student has unofficially withdrawn, unless the institution can document that the student completed the semester. Federal regulations require that a Title IV refund calculation be processed by the Director of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Faculty members keep attendance records and may report absences deemed excessive to the student support system whenever counseling seems desirable. Each instructor may enforce attendance policies independently, however. Students must take responsibility for contacting faculty regarding their anticipated absences for curricular and co-curricular activities and arranging for make-up work as expected. Students who anticipate absences because of curricular or co-curricular activities should make every effort to avoid other absences from classes. Guidelines regarding student absences for curricular and co-curricular activities are provided in the Student Handbook. For more information about these guidelines, contact the Academic Affairs Office or the Student Life Office. The culmination period for traditional semester-long courses is a week-long interval in which no lecture examinations, tests, or quizzes are given (exceptions include laboratory practical examinations, activity examinations, final performances, makeup or repeat examinations, and self-paced examinations). The Academic Affairs Office may grant other exceptions. Commonly referred to as “Dead Week,” this period begins at 8 a.m. seven days before final examinations commence, and remains in effect until the beginning of the first exam of Finals Week. Courses offered in sessions shorter than the full semester do not have a Culmination Period. A final examination period is scheduled for traditional semester-long courses and second eight-week courses. No separate final exams are scheduled for first eight-week courses; final exams are completed during the last scheduled class meeting. The Final Examination Schedule is posted each semester according to the day\/time of the course section (see Registrar's Office website for final exam schedule). Each course must meet no fewer than 50 minutes during the period specified in the final exam schedule. Any deviation from the published Final Examination Schedule must be approved by the Dean of Undergraduate Programs a minimum of 24 hours before the final in question. (Exception: if there are multiple sections of a course, an instructor may allow a student to meet at the final exam time of another section of the same course.) All students, including seniors, take final examinations in each course for which they are registered unless the instructor exempts individual students from this requirement. The Academic Year\nThe traditional academic year is divided into two 16-week semesters, a winter term between the semesters, and summer sessions. Fall and Spring Semesters\nThe first semester, referred to as the “Fall” semester, begins in late August and ends before Christmas. The second or “Spring” semester, begins in January and ends in early May. Some courses within a semester may be taught in shorter sessions, such as eight-weeks. A five-week Winter Term is available between the Fall and Spring semesters (overlaps with both semesters), offering courses in arranged, online, or hybrid formats, to provide students the opportunity to complete a course during the holiday break. Courses are regularly scheduled in Summer five- and eight-week sessions. Faculty-led travel courses are also often offered in the summer. Definition of the Credit Hour\nNebraska Wesleyan University follows the Federal Credit Hour Definition.\n\nAll registrations require a 30% deposit which will be forfeited if a registration is canceled. For fully paid registrations, the cancelation fee is 30%. There are no refunds after the semester has begun. Ohana Music Together reserves the right to cancel, and\/or combine, any class with insufficient enrollment. All efforts will be made to provide families with alternative classes. If a suitable option is not found, families in cancelled classes will receive a full refund (if a family already received and opened their materials, the cost will be deducted from their refund). Ohana Music Together also reserves the right to substitute a different teacher than the teacher originally listed on the website for whatever reason deemed necessary by Ohana Music Together. We offer installment plans. This allows you to make three smaller payments on your account. However, when you sign up for an installment plan, you are signing a contract with us. We contract with you to provide the classes you are registering for and you contract with us that you will pay the full tuition. If you miss classes for whatever reason, you will still be charged the full amount that you contracted to pay because we have fulfilled our part of the contract by providing the classes regardless of whether or not you attended. All makeups must be scheduled through the makeup scheduler on our website. No walk-in makeups will be accepted. Each family may make up three missed classes per semester, either ahead of a planned absence such as a trip, or after an unplanned absence such as an illness. Make-ups are a courtesy...the spaces we have are limited and we can’t guarantee make-ups for everyone who misses a class. If you schedule a make-up and miss it without canceling, it's forfeited. Make-ups must be used during the current semester and may not be ‘rolled over’. We feel that being able to makeup 30% of your classes is a generous policy…please do not ask for extra makeups. Please do not bring a sick child to class. Use your make-ups so that children, parents and teachers may maintain optimum health. Your fellow parents will appreciate your decision to keep your child at home. If you (the adult) are sick, please make use of the wipes and\/or sanitizing gel during class. In cases where anyone at home has pinkeye or hand, foot and mouth disease, please do not come to class. CELL PHONES, CAMERAS & OTHER ELECTRONICS:\nPlease turn off and put away cell phones, cameras and electronic gadgets once inside the classroom. Imagine your child looking to you for reinforcement or interaction and you are looking at an electronic screen rather than engaging with them. You are welcome to take photos before or after class, just not during class. The final class of the semester, you may take photographs, but please still use the time to mainly interact with your child rather than the phone\/camera. CONVERSATION DURING CLASS:\nPlease keep conversation to a minimum during class. Your child learns how to behave in a classroom directly from how you behave in the classroom. If you are busy conversing with a neighbor and not enthusiastically participating in the class, your child learns that talking and inattention to the teacher is appropriate classroom behavior. We love that our classes help people make connections with other mothers and fathers and we encourage you to do that before and after class. FOOD, DRINKS, TOYS, ETC. :\nFood and drink is prohibited in the classroom. We want to keep the classroom clean, but also other children will gravitate to your child's snack which creates problems. Please also leave toys outside in the car or at least outside the classroom area. A toy brought into the class creates tension between the other children who want to play with it and your child who wants to keep it, thereby disrupting the class. The adult attending class with a child is responsible for that child’s behavior. Although we accept age-appropriate kinetic behavior, a child’s motor control isn’t well-developed enough to avoid collisions when running and it often leads to injury of the child him\/herself or another child. Your teacher will ask that a child engaging in running or other wild physical movement be taken out of the room to be calmed down. If a situation becomes chronic and disruptive it will be referred by your teacher to the director for resolution. Always contact the director for permission to bring an extra child, or any more than one extra adult (e.g. grandparent).\n\nQuestion:Is there a financial penalty for not showing up to a scheduled OWI class in Iowa?",

In both classes, they came to realize that any punishment would result in even more of my time being wasted. Also, we discussed how taking points off (2nd class's idea) doesn't go along with my s-b grading at all. In both classes, we discussed how it all comes down to effort and responsibility. I told them that my brother, a high school math teacher (Matt Townsley), questioned if 6th graders were really responsible\/capable enough to handle the retakes system. Both classes said they were. They said if people are showing up, it shows that anyone can be capable of showing up. I ended the conversation with saying that I hope the next time they sign up for a retake, they keep this conversation in mind. Even though the 2nd class said posting a schedule would take up my time, I still might consider doing it to see if it helps at all. But, if they write it down in their planners and don't look at those, will they look at a schedule?",

            "passage": "SR-22 Insurance in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance applies to drivers who have at some point demonstrated reckless driving. An SR22 form is a voucher that an insurance company must submit to the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT). The form proves the driver has auto insurance as well as how much and when the policy was enacted. Not all drivers need SR22, and the IDOT outlines the guidelines under which it may be required. In most cases, an SR22 form is required to reinstate driving privileges due to license suspension. Described below is essential information on SR22 insurance and how it impacts your driving privileges. What is Iowa SR22 insurance? Insurance companies charge Iowa SR-22 rates to drivers who are required by law to obtain it as a part of their auto policy. As a policy add-on rather than a policy itself, an SR22 form demonstrates to the Iowa Department of Transportation that a driver has sufficient liability coverage as required by state law. The form contains information about the amount of liability coverage, the policy start date and whether or not the policy is active. A driver may not drop SR22 insurance without prior notice to the IDOT, as doing so could result in additional penalties and fines. Who needs SR22 insurance in Iowa? Most drivers do not need Iowa SR22 insurance, as the IDOT bases the requirement on traffic-related offenses. The IDOT determines who needs SR22 insurance forms and provides that driver with all the information about the requirement. According to the Iowa drivers manual, the IDOT requires the insurance for a variety of reasons, with the most common being:\n- Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) citation for a blood alcohol level .08 or higher. - Committing a vehicle offense that is punishable by a felony conviction such as vehicular manslaughter\n- Suspension due to out-of-state convictions\nDrivers questioning who needs SR22 insurance should consult the driver’s manual or speak with a member of IDOT staff for more information. In general, the state notifies drivers if they will need to purchase the insurance. The state also provides information on any necessary fees and the steps required to restore their driving privileges after a driver’s license suspension. Reinstating Driving Privileges With SR22 in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance cease once the driver has completed all requirements to restore their driving privileges. Once a driver is eligible to remove SR22 from their coverage, he or she must present what the state refers to as proof of future financial responsibility. In essence, motorists must prove to the IDOT that they have appropriate coverage in place to meet financial obligations for future driving incidents. Further, drivers must pay all applicable fees to reinstate their privileges. License and registration privileges apply to the vehicles for which motorists have provided proof of insurance. Thus, drivers must show proof of insurance for any vehicle registered in their name to cover all relevant cars. Drivers who are required to purchase SR22 insurance may qualify for a Temporary Restricted License (TRL). With a TRL, motorists may receive limited driving privileges to operate their vehicle for approved circumstances. Acceptable reasons for a TRL include driving to work, school or medical appointments. How to Get SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nIn Iowa, SR-22 rates are not set by the Department of Transportation. Insurance companies offer SR22 insurance quotes and provide the necessary coverage. Given that drivers who require this particular coverage are known for severe or repeated traffic-related incidents, many insurers do not offer the coverage. Those that do may charge a premium for the added feature to offset the potential financial risk for these drivers. As such, motorists should contact multiple companies for quotes. Some insurance companies offer SR-22 coverage as a rider to an existing policy. In some cases, they may require drivers to purchase an SR22 policy that contains the necessary coverage. Drivers who have questions on the specific amount of coverage needed should contact the IDOT for more information. How to File SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nAn Iowa SR22 form may only be submitted by an insurance company. The Department of Transportation does not accept SR22 forms from drivers, and motorists should request their insurer to file it on their behalf. Once submitted, the insurance company is required to update the Department of Transportation of any status changes on the policy. Should a driver cancel the SR22 policy, the insurer must notify the IDOT immediately.",

            "passage": "In all such cases, students must inform their instructors (and the Financial Aid Office, if appropriate) prior to their absence, when possible, and provide appropriate documentation. Each semester, students’ class schedules become official upon payment of required fees (either by the student or by award of financial aid). Students who drop a class during the drop\/add period (on or before the third day of the semester for a full semester class, or on or before the second day of the term for a term C class) will be removed from the class roll, and the course will not show on the student’s academic record. A 100 percent refund is issued for classes dropped during the drop\/add period of the term. Thereafter, students may officially withdraw from a course without academic penalty by the designated withdrawal date for the semester and receive a “W” grade for the course. The “W” grade is not computed in the student’s grade point average, but does count in terms of financial aid eligibility. To officially withdraw from a course, students can withdraw online or meet with an Enrollment Advisor in the Enrollment Support Center to fill out the appropriate forms. Students who must withdraw from all classes will have to do so in person at the Enrollment Support Center. There is no refund for classes withdrawn after the drop\/add period of the term. Students who withdraw after the designated withdrawal date for the semester will receive a “WF” grade, unless a “W” grade is approved by the Academic Affairs Office through the appeal process for hardship withdrawal. Students must follow the withdrawal procedure as described in the paragraph above. A “WF” grade is computed in the student’s grade point average as a failing grade and counts toward the student’s financial aid eligibility. If you are awarded financial aid, please refer to the Return to Tile IV Financial Aid Withdrawal Policy section of the catalog to determine the impact withdrawing from courses may have on your financial aid. Hardship Withdrawal Appeal\nStudents have the right to appeal for a Hardship Withdrawal with the Academic Affairs Office. Consideration of a Hardship Withdrawal is limited to certain criteria which may include, but is not limited to: hospitalization of the student, the death of an immediate family member during the semester of the withdrawal, the student being assigned to active military duty or jury duty for more than three consecutive days during the term. The student must have withdrawn from, or failed, all courses in the affected term for the appeal to be considered. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Academic Affairs Office no later than one week into the following term. All decisions on appeals of hardship withdrawals rendered by the Academic Affairs Office shall be final. Students who do not participate or attend in the first week of classes will be designated as “No Show” and will be removed from the class roster. Online students who do not participate during the first week of the term will be dropped as a “No Show.” For hybrid courses that meet once per week, students must attend or participate online during the first week to avoid “No Show” designation. For web-enhanced courses, students must attend during the first week to avoid “No Show” designation. When submitted as a “No Show”, the course will not appear on the student’s academic record and a 100 percent refund of applicable tuition and applicable refundable fees will be given. Financial aid students will be responsible for all charges related to any classes for which they are designated as “No Show”. Financial aid will not pay for “No-Show” classes. It is the student’s responsibility to confirm his\/her registration status for each course during the registration and drop\/add periods. The responsibility to register for classes and drop those classes that are no longer desired to be taken resides solely with the student. Classes in which students no longer desire to participate should be dropped during registration or the drop\/add period. The “No Show” process is the college’s administrative recordkeeping process and students should not attempt to use or rely on this process to ensure classes are removed from their schedules. A tardy will be recorded when a student arrives 1 to 10 minutes late for a class. When a student is tardy more than 10 minutes of a class hour, an absence will be recorded for one class period. Course syllabi identify those competencies that should be demonstrated by students in order to successfully complete a course. Course syllabi may also identify certain competencies as critical.",

Cancellations: Students may cancel their scheduled appointment up to 24 hours prior to the appointment day by either calling the CCPD (610-758-3710) or emailing their career coach. Late Cancellation: An appointment cancelled within the 24-hour period before the appointment is considered a Late Cancellation. No-Show: A No-Show is when a student fails to show for their scheduled appointment time. Consequence: A Late Cancellation or No-Show will automatically result in following actions being taken:\n- First Offense: If you do not show or do not cancel your appointment within 24 hours prior to your scheduled appointment you will receive an e-mail reminder about the Cancellation\/No-Show policy\n- Second Offense: You will receive an e-mail from the career coach alerting you that if you don't keep your 3rd appointment, you will not be allowed to schedule an individual appointment for the remainder of the semester, but will still have access to use Career Lab hours. - Third Offense: You will receive an e-mail notice that your privilege for scheduling an appointment is suspended for the remainder of the semester and that you may only use Career Lab during this time period. Late arrival for appointment policy:\nThe time allotted for your appointment is to ensure there is sufficient time to assist with your career needs.

            "passage": "You don’t have to go for 3s, a 2 is enough, but I want some way to signal to people that I noticed if you seem especially involved. Question: My friend said you have to do longer comments for this class, but I don’t see anything about that. What am I supposed to do? Answer: The class assignments have changed since the last time I taught the class. Read the syllabus for this term. There is one ungraded essay due to your TA in section on September 7 in which you write about your own ethnic\/racial background and experiences. 1-2 pages. Toward the end of the term you will write 150 minutes on an assignment that will be distributed in the second half of the class. Missed Class, Late Comments, Make Ups\nQuestion: What if I am sick? Answer: DO NOT come to class if you are sick. Do a make up. You will not be penalized, but you must do the make up to get credit for the missed class. (see below) Your claims of illness will generally be taken at face value, however it is academic misconduct to claim to be ill when you are not. “I need a mental health day” is not an illness. A communicable disease or a physical condition that makes it impossible to come to class is what is meant here. If you miss more than two or three classes due to illness, we will require more information. Question: What if I miss class for a religious holiday? Or because my child\/parent is ill? Or because I am in a car crash? Answer: If you miss class due to circumstances beyond your control (or a religious observance), do a make up. You will not be penalized, but you must do the make up to get credit for the class. (see below) Your claims of circumstances beyond your control will generally be taken at face value, however it is academic misconduct to lie about such circumstances and if you are claiming more than a day or two, we may ask for additional documentation. Question: How do I do a lecture make-up? Answer: (1) Talk to at least 4 different students to make sure you know what actually happened in the class you missed. Do not make assumptions. Sometimes the web site has not been updated. (2) Spend a minimum of 30 minutes doing reading, talking in some depth to 4 or more people from the class, or watching videos to find out what you missed, Then write (a) why you missed class (needed only if the absence should be excused) (b) what you did to make up the class (what you read, who you talked to) and (c) a minimum of 200 words describing what happened in the class that you missed. You still have to do a make-up even if the absence is excused due to illness, religious observance, or circumstances beyond your control. If your absence should be “excused” for illness or other reason, you need to give the reason in the make-up entry. We will ask for documentation of the circumstances if you are claiming a large number of excused absences. Question: I really need to study for my chemistry exam \/ got called into work \/ had a job interview \/ just didn’t feel like coming to class. Can I get credit? Answer: You can get credit for up to two voluntary (i.e. unexcused) absences by doing a lecture make up. You can get half credit for a make up for two more voluntary absences. Beyond that, you cannot get credit for missed classes. Please note: studying for another class, going to a special review session, taking two classes that overlap with each other, having job hours that conflict with class, having a job interview or taking a vacation do NOT count as circumstances beyond your control. While you sometimes have to make difficult choices, they are your choices. If you do have to take the point loss, it will not be great unless you miss a lot of classes. Question: What if I forgot to turn in my lecture comment when I left class? Can I email it to you? Or drop it off at your office? Will I still get credit if it is late? Answer: Do NOT email to me, do NOT drop it off anywhere, do NOT give it to your TA. The ONLY way I accept any lecture comments is in the folders. If you forget to turn it in, submit it to the folder at the next class with a note on it saying what happened. If this is a rare event, your explanation will be believed. If it happens often, you will need to do something to correct the problem or lose credit. Question: I had to come late\/leave early. Can I still get credit for the class?",

Ultimately it is the students' responsibility to officially drop any course they don't plan on attending before the drop deadline. Students who plan to discontinue a course after the drop deadline must officially withdraw from the course before the withdrawal deadline (see Withdrawal Policy). Note that if a student who has been awarded a federal loan and\/or grant does not officially withdraw and fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course over an entire semester, the institution must assume, for Title IV purposes, that the student has unofficially withdrawn, unless the institution can document that the student completed the semester. Federal regulations require that a Title IV refund calculation be processed by the Director of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Faculty members keep attendance records and may report absences deemed excessive to the student support system whenever counseling seems desirable. Each instructor may enforce attendance policies independently, however. Students must take responsibility for contacting faculty regarding their anticipated absences for curricular and co-curricular activities and arranging for make-up work as expected. Students who anticipate absences because of curricular or co-curricular activities should make every effort to avoid other absences from classes. Guidelines regarding student absences for curricular and co-curricular activities are provided in the Student Handbook. For more information about these guidelines, contact the Academic Affairs Office or the Student Life Office. The culmination period for traditional semester-long courses is a week-long interval in which no lecture examinations, tests, or quizzes are given (exceptions include laboratory practical examinations, activity examinations, final performances, makeup or repeat examinations, and self-paced examinations). The Academic Affairs Office may grant other exceptions. Commonly referred to as “Dead Week,” this period begins at 8 a.m. seven days before final examinations commence, and remains in effect until the beginning of the first exam of Finals Week. Courses offered in sessions shorter than the full semester do not have a Culmination Period. A final examination period is scheduled for traditional semester-long courses and second eight-week courses. No separate final exams are scheduled for first eight-week courses; final exams are completed during the last scheduled class meeting. The Final Examination Schedule is posted each semester according to the day\/time of the course section (see Registrar's Office website for final exam schedule). Each course must meet no fewer than 50 minutes during the period specified in the final exam schedule. Any deviation from the published Final Examination Schedule must be approved by the Dean of Undergraduate Programs a minimum of 24 hours before the final in question. (Exception: if there are multiple sections of a course, an instructor may allow a student to meet at the final exam time of another section of the same course.) All students, including seniors, take final examinations in each course for which they are registered unless the instructor exempts individual students from this requirement. The Academic Year\nThe traditional academic year is divided into two 16-week semesters, a winter term between the semesters, and summer sessions. Fall and Spring Semesters\nThe first semester, referred to as the “Fall” semester, begins in late August and ends before Christmas. The second or “Spring” semester, begins in January and ends in early May. Some courses within a semester may be taught in shorter sessions, such as eight-weeks. A five-week Winter Term is available between the Fall and Spring semesters (overlaps with both semesters), offering courses in arranged, online, or hybrid formats, to provide students the opportunity to complete a course during the holiday break. Courses are regularly scheduled in Summer five- and eight-week sessions. Faculty-led travel courses are also often offered in the summer.

All efforts will be made to provide families with alternative classes.

We offer installment plans. This allows you to make three smaller payments on your account. However, when you sign up for an installment plan, you are signing a contract with us. We contract with you to provide the classes you are registering for and you contract with us that you will pay the full tuition. If you miss classes for whatever reason, you will still be charged the full amount that you contracted to pay because we have fulfilled our part of the contract by providing the classes regardless of whether or not you attended. All makeups must be scheduled through the makeup scheduler on our website. No walk-in makeups will be accepted. Each family may make up three missed classes per semester, either ahead of a planned absence such as a trip, or after an unplanned absence such as an illness. Make-ups are a courtesy...the spaces we have are limited and we can’t guarantee make-ups for everyone who misses a class. If you schedule a make-up and miss it without canceling, it's forfeited. Make-ups must be used during the current semester and may not be ‘rolled over’. We feel that being able to makeup 30% of your classes is a generous policy…please do not ask for extra makeups. Please do not bring a sick child to class. Use your make-ups so that children, parents and teachers may maintain optimum health. Your fellow parents will appreciate your decision to keep your child at home. If you (the adult) are sick, please make use of the wipes and\/or sanitizing gel during class. In cases where anyone at home has pinkeye or hand, foot and mouth disease, please do not come to class. CELL PHONES, CAMERAS & OTHER ELECTRONICS:\nPlease turn off and put away cell phones, cameras and electronic gadgets once inside the classroom. Imagine your child looking to you for reinforcement or interaction and you are looking at an electronic screen rather than engaging with them. You are welcome to take photos before or after class, just not during class. The final class of the semester, you may take photographs, but please still use the time to mainly interact with your child rather than the phone\/camera. CONVERSATION DURING CLASS:\nPlease keep conversation to a minimum during class. Your child learns how to behave in a classroom directly from how you behave in the classroom. If you are busy conversing with a neighbor and not enthusiastically participating in the class, your child learns that talking and inattention to the teacher is appropriate classroom behavior. We love that our classes help people make connections with other mothers and fathers and we encourage you to do that before and after class. FOOD, DRINKS, TOYS, ETC. :\nFood and drink is prohibited in the classroom. We want to keep the classroom clean, but also other children will gravitate to your child's snack which creates problems. Please also leave toys outside in the car or at least outside the classroom area. A toy brought into the class creates tension between the other children who want to play with it and your child who wants to keep it, thereby disrupting the class. The adult attending class with a child is responsible for that child’s behavior. Although we accept age-appropriate kinetic behavior, a child’s motor control isn’t well-developed enough to avoid collisions when running and it often leads to injury of the child him\/herself or another child. Your teacher will ask that a child engaging in running or other wild physical movement be taken out of the room to be calmed down. If a situation becomes chronic and disruptive it will be referred by your teacher to the director for resolution. Always contact the director for permission to bring an extra child, or any more than one extra adult (e.g. grandparent).",

These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages\n\nWhen needs exceed local, tribal, and State resources, the Governor may request Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. While the Stafford Act may be the most familiar mechanism for Federal support, it is not the only one. Often, Federal assistance does not require coordination by the Department of Homeland Security and can be provided without a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. In these instances, Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to States, as well as directly to tribes and local jurisdictions, consistent with their own authorities. One of the tenets of professionalism in emergency management is the pursuit of continuous improvement. After the incident response winds down, resources are demobilized, and the EOC is deactivated, the emergency manager’s job is not finished. To complete the cycle of continuous improvement, it is important to conduct an after-action review to evaluate how well the policies and procedures outlined in the EOP worked, and how well prepared the jurisdiction was to conduct an effective response. This process should produce an after-action report and improvement plan with a timetable for carrying out any needed changes. Continue Your Learning: Next Steps\nBelow are some steps you can take to begin learning how your jurisdiction manages response operations. - Learn about your jurisdiction’s EOC. - Where is it located? - How is it organized? - What systems have been established for joint sharing of information? - What kinds of incident management systems are used? (For example, is there an electronic incident management system that provides for easy sharing of information?) - Learn about your jurisdiction’s response history. - What emergencies have been declared? - How often has the EOC been activated, and at what levels? - Review after-action reports and improvement plans. Were improvements recommended? Have improvement plans been implemented? Continue Your Learning: Additional Resources\nBelow are additional resources you can use to learn more about responding to emergencies. FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) Courses:\n- IS-100: Introduction to the Incident Command System (ICS)\n- IS-701: NIMS Multiagency Coordination Systems\n- IS-703: NIMS Resource Management\n- IS-775: EOC Management and Operations\nThis lesson discussed the emergency manager’s role in responding to an emergency, including:\n- Key roles and responsibilities of an emergency manager in emergency response. - Functions of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC). - Alternative ways an EOC can be organized. - Significance of coordinating information during incident response. - Role of the EOC in resource management during incident response. Lesson 7: Recovering From Emergencies\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in recovering from an emergency. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Identify core principles for recovery. - Describe the purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Identify typical disaster recovery operations. - Indicate the purpose of the Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Recovering From Emergencies\nThe capabilities required to recover from emergencies focus on restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of infrastructure; housing; sustainable economy; and the health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of the community. Recovery operations may range from damage assessment and building inspection to restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure. Recovery may include activities as diverse as care for survivors, community redevelopment, and support for business recovery. And recovery always requires documentation of disaster operations and costs. Recovery is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. All of these resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish an effective short- and long-term recovery. As an emergency manager, your role in the recovery process involves planning, managing, and coordinating the recovery effort. This lesson will introduce you to your recovery responsibilities and some of the resources available to you. The term recovery refers to those capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident in recovering effectively. It is focused on a timely restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of:\n- Sustainable economy. - Health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.\n\n- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event. Continue Your Learning: Next Steps\nBelow are some steps you can take to begin learning how your jurisdiction manages disaster recovery. - Find out what recovery policies, plans, and procedures your jurisdiction has in place. - What predisaster recovery plans have been developed (e.g., debris management plan, continuity of government plan, continuity of operations plan, other recovery plans)? - Is the emergency manager’s role specified in those plans? - When were the plans last updated? - What provisions have been made for setting up Disaster Recovery Centers when needed? - Learn about your jurisdiction’s recovery history. - Has your jurisdiction experienced disasters for which recovery plans were implemented? - What strategies were used to facilitate physical, economic, and emotional recovery of the community? Continue Your Learning: Additional Resources\nBelow are links to resources you can use to learn more about recovering from emergencies. FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) Courses:\n- IS-403: Introduction to Individual Assistance (IA)\n- IS-546: Continuity of Operations Awareness Course (introduces continuity planning)\n- IS-547: Introduction to Continuity of Operations\n- IS-559: Local Damage Assessment\n- IS-632: Introduction to Debris Operations\n- IS-634: Introduction to FEMA’s Public Assistance Program\nThis lesson discussed your role in recovering from an emergency, including:\n- Key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Core principles for recovery. - Purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Typical disaster recovery operations. - The Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Lesson 8: Administering Your Program\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in administering the emergency management program. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify typical administrative responsibilities of an emergency manager. - Describe staffing options for routine and emergency operations. - Identify items typically included in an emergency management budget. - Describe the importance of documentation in emergency management. - Indicate the characteristics of an effective records management system. - Explain the impact of privacy laws on recordkeeping. - Identify strategies to ensure information security. The Emergency Manager As Administrator\nThe administrative functions of daily operations affect the community’s ability to respond effectively during emergencies. Four important administrative functions are carried out on a daily basis and during emergencies:\n- Budgeting and Accounting\n- Records Management\n- Information Security\nEmergency Management Programs: No Single Model\nStaffing requirements and resources vary from one community to the next. A large city or county may have a full-time emergency manager with a paid supporting staff. There also may be a full-time fire and police department.\n\n|← Modern Family and Marriage||Questions Answers →|\nThe guidance presented by the National Preparedness Goal creates the key for the success of emergency management. The guidance that seeks to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover is independent and requires the emergency department to employ the current preparedness networks, upgrade training programs, and ensure high capabilities of financial, administrative, and logistics systems. In addition, the above-presented goals provide the community and individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge that are aimed at enabling the entire community to benefit from the preparedness for natural disasters. Greater preparedness for contingencies reduces the probability of risks the nation might face and increases the level of sustainability. Consequently, as soon as the emergency department develops the core capabilities, it can be more prepared for various challenges. What is more important is that these capabilities will allow emergency managers to fill the existing gaps and define the targets for measuring and developing new approaches to coping with the natural contingencies. The existence of the core capabilities is important because they allow distributing the responsibilities among department managers. For instance, prevention mechanism deals with such spheres as intelligence and information exchange, forensics and attribution, detection, screening and search. Other capabilities refer to different areas for which emergency department holds responsibility. In my opinion, the emergency management makes everything possible to build, sustain, and develop the capabilities for strengthening community resources and advancing individuals’ capabilities. Personnel and equipment should be enhanced to ensure proper quality of plan implementation. Additionally, the national preparedness system focuses on the overall collaborative level of the community and individual perception of the critical responsibilities and tasks. It also ensures that the community is ready to react to natural disasters or man-made contingencies. However, there are still points that need to be discussed. This is of particular concern to the personnel department that should be constantly trained and developed to ensure the proper level of protection. \"This web helped me with writing my essay.

He knows first-hand the challenges that come with sustaining a preparedness and response knowledge base, especially during times of budgets cuts and staff reductions. “Many of the public health pioneers that established current programs have moved on to new endeavors or retired and took critical knowledge and skills with them.”\nMcHargue is responsible for implementing Health and Medical preparedness capabilities during emergencies and coordinating the ESF8 (Health and Medical) support activities within the established emergency response systems with local, state, and federal partners. “At the State ESF 8 level, we provide planning, training, and exercise support to train and develop current and future practitioners and leaders for local County Health Departments and the Department of Health,” he says. Mentees who are looking to gain employment in preparedness and response positions should have a range of capabilities – from public health knowledge and clinical skills to emergency management experience. Of course, formal training in Basic National Incident Management System (NIMS) for ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 are required pre-requisites. McHargue believes that a combination of these skills among their total staff is vital to effective preparedness and response planning and implementation. “We also seek out [professionals] who are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances, are available to work altered work schedules, are available to deploy to the field, and demonstrate their ability to collaborate with diverse groups for planning and response activities,” he says.

In reality, emergency management is not just about the core functions involved in response. It includes a broad array of program functions, and much of the work is of a nonemergency nature. Core functions are those that are critical to a successful emergency response. Emergency managers are responsible for the following core functions:\n- Direction, control, and coordination\n- External affairs\/Emergency public information\n- Population protection\n- Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services\n- Public health and medical services\n- Logistics management and resource support\nIn addition to the emergency core functions, the emergency manager directs the day-to-day emergency management program that enables the jurisdiction to build and sustain needed capabilities and maintain a state of preparedness. Examples of nonemergency program activities include:\n- Ongoing monitoring of threat\/hazard information. - Developing and updating plans. - Recruiting and training staff. - Planning and coordinating exercises. - Budgeting, accounting, and grant writing. - Building relationships across the community. - Educating the public. - Organizing for hazard mitigation. - Soliciting public input on recovery planning. - Documenting, reporting, and managing information. A key role that runs through core functions and emergency functions alike is that of coordinating information—keeping the community, stakeholders, and officials informed. Information empowers community members to make informed choices that affect their health and well-being. And when incidents occur, information enables stakeholders to manage the situation effectively. Keeping the Public Informed\nRegardless of who delivers information to the public—the emergency manager, a public information officer, or other spokesperson—you are responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to keep the public informed and warned. The system must be able to reach all segments of the population, and the information they receive must be:\n- Simple and clear. - Focused on the immediate needs. - Helpful for building confidence in the response. Underlying all the other qualities, functions, and activities of an emergency manager is an expectation of ethical conduct. As an emergency management professional, you represent your organization and your profession. Your actions must instill trust and confidence in those with whom you work and in those who depend on you for assistance. In an emergency, the community and your partners must be able to count on you to carry out your responsibilities in a professional and fair manner. The SELF Test\nAsk yourself . . . Do my decisions withstand . . . Do my decisions . . . Do my decisions show . . . Are my decisions . . . Typical Emergency Manager Responsibilities\nNow that you have a general picture of the broad roles of the emergency manager, let’s take a closer look at what these roles mean in terms of specific responsibilities. Typical emergency manager tasks can be arranged by incident phase:\n- Determine overall capabilities. - Plan for emergencies that may arise and keep the emergency operations plan (EOP) up to date. - Provide support and advice to elected officials in establishing and carrying out policy. - Educate the public. - Plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate training and exercises. - Identify resource needs and sources of resources. Incident Response Responsibilities:\n- Establish and maintain a common understanding of the situation. - Coordinate with other agencies, jurisdictions, and levels of government on resource allocation, communications and information management, and public information. - Advise elected and appointed officials on policy. - Provide off-site support to the Incident Command (typically a small part of the emergency manager’s role). Post-Incident and Recovery Responsibilities:\n- Initiate damage assessments. - Coordinate with agencies providing food and shelter. - Coordinate with agencies to restore essential services (power, roads, etc.). - Conduct the after-action evaluation and develop an improvement plan. - Determine how emergency management and response can be better integrated. - Fully document incident activities and related costs. - Ensure that all bills are paid. - Replenish supplies. - Initiate long-term recovery plans. - Implement mitigation plans. - Oversee long-term recovery efforts.\n\n- Postdisaster planning is a discrete process for the disaster at hand that results in integrated recovery and reconstruction programs, actions, and recovery. Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.\n\nFor those with an interested in pursuing a career in Emergency Management, they'll be working in a field with a dedication for creating frameworks that assist in helping communities reduce their vulnerabilities to various kinds of disasters and cope with the unfortunate aftereffects. Some of these threats include disease epidemics, droughts, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters. There are human-made hazards, as well, including displaced populations, industrial accidents, and famine. Recently, Emergency Management posted positions have emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, mitigation, and resilience. You'll find that the educational requirements for this line of work are going to vary according to the job title. For those with interest in undertaking leadership roles including Director of Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery Coordinator, and Emergency Management Specialist, this field will be ideal for you. Many PhD emergency management programs offered online or through hybrid distance learning are equally suitable for attaining a successful future in the discipline. Common Coursework Requirements for an Emergency Management Doctoral Degree\nThose working toward their emergency management degree will find that their coursework typically focuses on theories and concepts that shape historical trends as well as modern emergency management. Additional courses explore processes, procedures, and policies that are occurring during an emergency, along with social and political factors affecting emergency management within our country (such as the Department of Homeland Security). Risk management is also stressed throughout additional programs during the phd emergency management online coursework. Each course will explore methods of evaluating resources and communities to determine how vulnerable they are to a disaster and ways for mitigating risks. There are also courses available emphasizing on disaster response and recovery. When you take these courses, you'll learn strategies for how to handle disasters and how they could impact a surrounding community. Additionally, you'll be working on frameworks for management that will oversee responses and operations for recovery. On top of these courses with a dedication to earning your emergency management degree, you'll find these programs also offer quantitative and qualitative research protocols and methods that should be followed throughout the research design process. The Costs Associated with a Doctorate in Emergency Management\nSeveral factors come into play when determining the costs in association with obtaining an online doctorate in emergency management. For example, if you are residing in the same state as the college, you're attending, that will lower the cost of tuition. However, you may find that if you're attending college online, some colleges will charge a flat rate for those courses no matter where you reside. Another critical factor to take into consideration is technology fees, which are typically applied to online students and not those who are attending brick-and-mortar schools. Under most circumstances, the per-credit costs associated with taking online courses for an emergency management doctoral degree will range between $460 and $700. The total tuition students can expect to pay is between $27,000 and $45,000. PhD Disaster Management Scholarship Opportunities\nThere are opportunities in colleges and universities across the United States to apply for a PhD disaster management scholarship. Jacksonville State University has a page of specific Emergency Management scholarships available for a variety of students meeting different criteria. Those who have an interest in pursuing different risk management or disaster courses, can also apply for these scholarships. No matter if you're a full-time or part-time student, you can find and apply for scholarships and financial aid opportunities.\n\nIf you feel that you're naturally adept at handling challenging conversations, organizing projects or other managerial tasks, the online master's degree in management program could further and refine your abilities and help you on the path to a successful career. SNHU also offers three concentrations in the MS in Management degree: Construction Management, Emergency Management and Healthcare Management. Choosing a specific concentration can help you acquire the particular skills that you'll need after graduation for the career of your choice. SNHU's new MS in Management with a concentration in Construction Management is ideal if you want to take on a leadership role in the construction industry. Communication is an integral part of any management role, and it's also essential in the construction field. You'll develop strong skills - verbal, written, presentation and technical - allowing you to become a strong communicator across all segments of your team. You'll establish effective project and management plans, prioritizing responsibilities and tasks, and be able to offer cost and data analysis on projects. The U.S. Department of Labor project nearly 18,000 new jobs in construction management by 2024*, which means that time is ripe for you to begin your journey toward a leadership role in this burgeoning industry. Salary.com notes that construction managers can earn a median annual salary of $103,585, and while salaries may differ depending on the type of construction industry, size, location and your experience, this figure was derived from data collected from thousands of HR departments nationwide. Your roles may vary within the construction industry, but with your MS in Management with a concentration in Construction Management, you'll target positions such as these: construction manager, foreman, superintendent, general contractor, estimator, scheduler, project manager and projects executive, along with other integral lead roles. While construction managers often work from an office setting, their responsibilities often include site visits, where they interact with staff and crews, ensuring work is completely on budget and on time. They often consult with owners, design professionals and contractor, overseeing coordination and scheduling, inspections and compliance reviews for safety and environmental regulations. Your role is critical to the success of every project. With SNHU's online MS in Management with a concentration in Emergency Management, you'll be skilled in minimizing risk and safeguarding the public, with the ability to plan, prepare and respond to critical threats in diverse situations. From natural disasters to organization crises, you'll have what it takes to make the difference in times of strife and deliver the best possible outcomes. According to the BLS, emergency management directors have a median salary of $59,770 annually. These individuals prepare businesses, cities and governments for natural disasters and emergencies. Some work in hospitals creating response plans and protocol to address such situations should they arise. Others are employed by area governments to make evacuation routes and collaborate with emergency responders such as local police and fire departments. When you earn a degree in emergency management from SNHU, you're in a position to pursue a number of careers in the field. Government agencies, healthcare, education and private business all need emergency managers to fill particular roles, and the skills you learn in the degree program can be applied across a variety of industries. One popular option is to pursue a career as a disaster program manager. Organizations such as the Red Cross hire managers to implement disaster program services in specific geographic areas. You may work with volunteers or employees to prepare for and respond to emergencies and assist in recovery after the event. Other graduates pursue a fulfilling career as an emergency preparedness coordinator. In this position, you'll oversee emergency preparedness activities for organizations, ensuring that the necessary structure is in place for unexpected events. You'll likely serve as a representative in the community, working with partners, local organizations and others to ensure that your employer is prepared in the event of an emergency. So what's the difference between healthcare managers and healthcare administrators? Both positions perform crucial roles in the development and maintenance of healthcare institutions. While each works for the betterment of the organization, the main difference lies in what these individuals oversee. Healthcare managers run the organization while administrators lead the staff, including clinicians. Managers spend their time developing new policies and altering existing policies, as well as handling accounting needs and overseeing the facility. Smaller healthcare facilities may merge administrators and managers, creating a team that works together to address staffing, accounting and facilities management.\n\nAs an example, immediately following the storm, I briefly sat in the FEMA Operations Center. A call came in for temporary housing. Racking my brain for atypical sources, since all the typical ones were either underwater or already engaged, I came up with real estate management firms. I called one of the largest. They said, “Love to help, but we manage office space. We can’t convert that to housing. Sorry.” Weeks later, I relayed this story to a local NGO in New Jersey. The poor woman’s head nearly exploded in frustration, “Argh! We needed office space for staging areas!” She hadn’t thought to ask for office space from businesses, and even if she had, chances are slim that her request would have surfaced to me in DC. Now, it is true that systems like Aidmatrixexist and act as big spreadsheets in the sky for cataloging needs, especially for product donations. Those systems have their own advantages and disadvantages and smart people are hard at work trying to improve them. But even those plans won’t address several core challenges. First, at a basic level, we need systems for dealing with services, skills-based volunteers, and directed cash donations. To deal with part of this challenge BCLC has partnered with National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) to launch a Disaster Recovery Aid Portal for these specific needs. More fundamentally, however, we also need a bit of rapid human intervention. My Dean Witter broker, back when I was in eighth grade, did more than just match cells on a spreadsheet. He helped broker high-value relationships by understanding both the buyer’s and seller’s needs. The same thing is needed for disaster recovery and rebuilding. The BCLC\/NVOAD portal will do some of that by inserting an actual human being into the posting\/matching process to ensure the needs from NGOs and governments are expressed in a way that a company can respond to. We also need a broader conversation about the role of businesses in disaster rebuilding and recovery. It has become increasingly common practice for companies like UPS and FedEx or Walmart and Target to embed in emergency management operations centers so they can coordinate with the governments and bring their supply chains to bear immediately following a disaster. That kind of partnership needs to extend beyond immediate relief efforts and security issues (so called “first response”) to the medium-term issues of rebuilding and long-term recovery (“second response”). Doing that will help breakdown several cultural and institutional barriers that currently impede long-term recovery. On the cultural side, many people in NGOs and governments inherently distrust business. Part of that is inherent to their position: they have to keep potential vendors at arm’s-length to avoid compromising the procurement process. But it also comes from a knee-jerk suspicion of the motives of the private sector. On the other side, businesses, like the rest of us, have short attention spans. While they’re willing to open their wallets in the immediate aftermath, once things leave the front page, their interest and giving often wanes. Which is a shame, because if anyone has the know-how to solve these long-term issues, it’s business. We need to simultaneously better educate NGOs and governments on how to work with businesses and raise awareness among companies of the roles they can play in a long-term solution. Governments and NGOs shouldn’t be naïve in selecting partners, as there will always be bad actors, but they need to learn how to separate the good from the bad. And businesses need to give smarter, focusing their resources on the problems they can uniquely solve. Disasters, like many other problems, are beset by silos. Government agencies work in their lanes, NGOs in theirs. Businesses, same story. “Outcome brokers aren’t slowed down by silos. Instead, they’re focused and designed to solve problems,” says Frank DiGiammarino. An outcome broker for disaster recovery would cut across these different sectors and craft hyper-local solutions, drawing on the vast institutional resources from each. I haven’t cracked the code on what an outcome broker would look like for disaster recovery, but drawing on lessons from other models, here are some attributes:\n- Cross-sector governance. The major parties — businesses, governments, and NGOs — need equal seats at the table.\n\nQuestion:I'm interested in emergency management careers. What key capabilities should I develop to assist with both immediate disaster response and long-term recovery efforts?",

            "passage": "3 Key Competencies of Emergency and Asset Management Programs\nWe’ve seen a meteoric rise in the number of disaster and emergency management degree programs. These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages",

            "passage": "When needs exceed local, tribal, and State resources, the Governor may request Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. While the Stafford Act may be the most familiar mechanism for Federal support, it is not the only one. Often, Federal assistance does not require coordination by the Department of Homeland Security and can be provided without a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. In these instances, Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to States, as well as directly to tribes and local jurisdictions, consistent with their own authorities. One of the tenets of professionalism in emergency management is the pursuit of continuous improvement. After the incident response winds down, resources are demobilized, and the EOC is deactivated, the emergency manager’s job is not finished. To complete the cycle of continuous improvement, it is important to conduct an after-action review to evaluate how well the policies and procedures outlined in the EOP worked, and how well prepared the jurisdiction was to conduct an effective response. This process should produce an after-action report and improvement plan with a timetable for carrying out any needed changes.

Lesson 7: Recovering From Emergencies\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in recovering from an emergency. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Identify core principles for recovery. - Describe the purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Identify typical disaster recovery operations. - Indicate the purpose of the Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Recovering From Emergencies\nThe capabilities required to recover from emergencies focus on restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of infrastructure; housing; sustainable economy; and the health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of the community. Recovery operations may range from damage assessment and building inspection to restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure. Recovery may include activities as diverse as care for survivors, community redevelopment, and support for business recovery. And recovery always requires documentation of disaster operations and costs. Recovery is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. All of these resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish an effective short- and long-term recovery. As an emergency manager, your role in the recovery process involves planning, managing, and coordinating the recovery effort. This lesson will introduce you to your recovery responsibilities and some of the resources available to you. The term recovery refers to those capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident in recovering effectively. It is focused on a timely restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of:\n- Sustainable economy. - Health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.",

Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event.

            "passage": "|← Modern Family and Marriage||Questions Answers →|\nThe guidance presented by the National Preparedness Goal creates the key for the success of emergency management. The guidance that seeks to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover is independent and requires the emergency department to employ the current preparedness networks, upgrade training programs, and ensure high capabilities of financial, administrative, and logistics systems. In addition, the above-presented goals provide the community and individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge that are aimed at enabling the entire community to benefit from the preparedness for natural disasters. Greater preparedness for contingencies reduces the probability of risks the nation might face and increases the level of sustainability. Consequently, as soon as the emergency department develops the core capabilities, it can be more prepared for various challenges. What is more important is that these capabilities will allow emergency managers to fill the existing gaps and define the targets for measuring and developing new approaches to coping with the natural contingencies. The existence of the core capabilities is important because they allow distributing the responsibilities among department managers. For instance, prevention mechanism deals with such spheres as intelligence and information exchange, forensics and attribution, detection, screening and search. Other capabilities refer to different areas for which emergency department holds responsibility. In my opinion, the emergency management makes everything possible to build, sustain, and develop the capabilities for strengthening community resources and advancing individuals’ capabilities. Personnel and equipment should be enhanced to ensure proper quality of plan implementation. Additionally, the national preparedness system focuses on the overall collaborative level of the community and individual perception of the critical responsibilities and tasks. It also ensures that the community is ready to react to natural disasters or man-made contingencies. However, there are still points that need to be discussed. This is of particular concern to the personnel department that should be constantly trained and developed to ensure the proper level of protection. \"This web helped me with writing my essay.

He knows first-hand the challenges that come with sustaining a preparedness and response knowledge base, especially during times of budgets cuts and staff reductions. “Many of the public health pioneers that established current programs have moved on to new endeavors or retired and took critical knowledge and skills with them.”\nMcHargue is responsible for implementing Health and Medical preparedness capabilities during emergencies and coordinating the ESF8 (Health and Medical) support activities within the established emergency response systems with local, state, and federal partners. “At the State ESF 8 level, we provide planning, training, and exercise support to train and develop current and future practitioners and leaders for local County Health Departments and the Department of Health,” he says. Mentees who are looking to gain employment in preparedness and response positions should have a range of capabilities – from public health knowledge and clinical skills to emergency management experience. Of course, formal training in Basic National Incident Management System (NIMS) for ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 are required pre-requisites. McHargue believes that a combination of these skills among their total staff is vital to effective preparedness and response planning and implementation. “We also seek out [professionals] who are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances, are available to work altered work schedules, are available to deploy to the field, and demonstrate their ability to collaborate with diverse groups for planning and response activities,” he says.

            "passage": "Routine Functions\nBecause the emergency manager takes on a higher profile during emergencies, a common perception is that all emergency management responsibilities are related to responding to emergencies. In reality, emergency management is not just about the core functions involved in response. It includes a broad array of program functions, and much of the work is of a nonemergency nature. Core functions are those that are critical to a successful emergency response. Emergency managers are responsible for the following core functions:\n- Direction, control, and coordination\n- External affairs\/Emergency public information\n- Population protection\n- Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services\n- Public health and medical services\n- Logistics management and resource support\nIn addition to the emergency core functions, the emergency manager directs the day-to-day emergency management program that enables the jurisdiction to build and sustain needed capabilities and maintain a state of preparedness. Examples of nonemergency program activities include:\n- Ongoing monitoring of threat\/hazard information. - Developing and updating plans. - Recruiting and training staff. - Planning and coordinating exercises. - Budgeting, accounting, and grant writing. - Building relationships across the community. - Educating the public. - Organizing for hazard mitigation. - Soliciting public input on recovery planning. - Documenting, reporting, and managing information. A key role that runs through core functions and emergency functions alike is that of coordinating information—keeping the community, stakeholders, and officials informed. Information empowers community members to make informed choices that affect their health and well-being. And when incidents occur, information enables stakeholders to manage the situation effectively. Keeping the Public Informed\nRegardless of who delivers information to the public—the emergency manager, a public information officer, or other spokesperson—you are responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to keep the public informed and warned. The system must be able to reach all segments of the population, and the information they receive must be:\n- Simple and clear. - Focused on the immediate needs. - Helpful for building confidence in the response. Underlying all the other qualities, functions, and activities of an emergency manager is an expectation of ethical conduct. As an emergency management professional, you represent your organization and your profession. Your actions must instill trust and confidence in those with whom you work and in those who depend on you for assistance. In an emergency, the community and your partners must be able to count on you to carry out your responsibilities in a professional and fair manner. The SELF Test\nAsk yourself . . . Do my decisions withstand . . . Do my decisions . . . Do my decisions show . . . Are my decisions . . . Typical Emergency Manager Responsibilities\nNow that you have a general picture of the broad roles of the emergency manager, let’s take a closer look at what these roles mean in terms of specific responsibilities. Typical emergency manager tasks can be arranged by incident phase:\n- Determine overall capabilities. - Plan for emergencies that may arise and keep the emergency operations plan (EOP) up to date. - Provide support and advice to elected officials in establishing and carrying out policy. - Educate the public. - Plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate training and exercises. - Identify resource needs and sources of resources. Incident Response Responsibilities:\n- Establish and maintain a common understanding of the situation. - Coordinate with other agencies, jurisdictions, and levels of government on resource allocation, communications and information management, and public information. - Advise elected and appointed officials on policy. - Provide off-site support to the Incident Command (typically a small part of the emergency manager’s role). Post-Incident and Recovery Responsibilities:\n- Initiate damage assessments. - Coordinate with agencies providing food and shelter. - Coordinate with agencies to restore essential services (power, roads, etc.). - Conduct the after-action evaluation and develop an improvement plan. - Determine how emergency management and response can be better integrated. - Fully document incident activities and related costs. - Ensure that all bills are paid. - Replenish supplies. - Initiate long-term recovery plans. - Implement mitigation plans. - Oversee long-term recovery efforts.",

            "passage": "- Postdisaster planning is a discrete process for the disaster at hand that results in integrated recovery and reconstruction programs, actions, and recovery. Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.",

Some of these threats include disease epidemics, droughts, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters. There are human-made hazards, as well, including displaced populations, industrial accidents, and famine. Recently, Emergency Management posted positions have emphasized the importance of business continuity planning, mitigation, and resilience. You'll find that the educational requirements for this line of work are going to vary according to the job title. For those with interest in undertaking leadership roles including Director of Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery Coordinator, and Emergency Management Specialist, this field will be ideal for you. Many PhD emergency management programs offered online or through hybrid distance learning are equally suitable for attaining a successful future in the discipline. Common Coursework Requirements for an Emergency Management Doctoral Degree\nThose working toward their emergency management degree will find that their coursework typically focuses on theories and concepts that shape historical trends as well as modern emergency management. Additional courses explore processes, procedures, and policies that are occurring during an emergency, along with social and political factors affecting emergency management within our country (such as the Department of Homeland Security). Risk management is also stressed throughout additional programs during the phd emergency management online coursework. Each course will explore methods of evaluating resources and communities to determine how vulnerable they are to a disaster and ways for mitigating risks. There are also courses available emphasizing on disaster response and recovery. When you take these courses, you'll learn strategies for how to handle disasters and how they could impact a surrounding community. Additionally, you'll be working on frameworks for management that will oversee responses and operations for recovery. On top of these courses with a dedication to earning your emergency management degree, you'll find these programs also offer quantitative and qualitative research protocols and methods that should be followed throughout the research design process. The Costs Associated with a Doctorate in Emergency Management\nSeveral factors come into play when determining the costs in association with obtaining an online doctorate in emergency management. For example, if you are residing in the same state as the college, you're attending, that will lower the cost of tuition. However, you may find that if you're attending college online, some colleges will charge a flat rate for those courses no matter where you reside. Another critical factor to take into consideration is technology fees, which are typically applied to online students and not those who are attending brick-and-mortar schools. Under most circumstances, the per-credit costs associated with taking online courses for an emergency management doctoral degree will range between $460 and $700. The total tuition students can expect to pay is between $27,000 and $45,000. PhD Disaster Management Scholarship Opportunities\nThere are opportunities in colleges and universities across the United States to apply for a PhD disaster management scholarship. Jacksonville State University has a page of specific Emergency Management scholarships available for a variety of students meeting different criteria. Those who have an interest in pursuing different risk management or disaster courses, can also apply for these scholarships. No matter if you're a full-time or part-time student, you can find and apply for scholarships and financial aid opportunities.",

Salary.com notes that construction managers can earn a median annual salary of $103,585, and while salaries may differ depending on the type of construction industry, size, location and your experience, this figure was derived from data collected from thousands of HR departments nationwide. Your roles may vary within the construction industry, but with your MS in Management with a concentration in Construction Management, you'll target positions such as these: construction manager, foreman, superintendent, general contractor, estimator, scheduler, project manager and projects executive, along with other integral lead roles. While construction managers often work from an office setting, their responsibilities often include site visits, where they interact with staff and crews, ensuring work is completely on budget and on time. They often consult with owners, design professionals and contractor, overseeing coordination and scheduling, inspections and compliance reviews for safety and environmental regulations. Your role is critical to the success of every project. With SNHU's online MS in Management with a concentration in Emergency Management, you'll be skilled in minimizing risk and safeguarding the public, with the ability to plan, prepare and respond to critical threats in diverse situations. From natural disasters to organization crises, you'll have what it takes to make the difference in times of strife and deliver the best possible outcomes. According to the BLS, emergency management directors have a median salary of $59,770 annually. These individuals prepare businesses, cities and governments for natural disasters and emergencies. Some work in hospitals creating response plans and protocol to address such situations should they arise. Others are employed by area governments to make evacuation routes and collaborate with emergency responders such as local police and fire departments. When you earn a degree in emergency management from SNHU, you're in a position to pursue a number of careers in the field. Government agencies, healthcare, education and private business all need emergency managers to fill particular roles, and the skills you learn in the degree program can be applied across a variety of industries. One popular option is to pursue a career as a disaster program manager. Organizations such as the Red Cross hire managers to implement disaster program services in specific geographic areas. You may work with volunteers or employees to prepare for and respond to emergencies and assist in recovery after the event. Other graduates pursue a fulfilling career as an emergency preparedness coordinator. In this position, you'll oversee emergency preparedness activities for organizations, ensuring that the necessary structure is in place for unexpected events. You'll likely serve as a representative in the community, working with partners, local organizations and others to ensure that your employer is prepared in the event of an emergency. So what's the difference between healthcare managers and healthcare administrators? Both positions perform crucial roles in the development and maintenance of healthcare institutions. While each works for the betterment of the organization, the main difference lies in what these individuals oversee. Healthcare managers run the organization while administrators lead the staff, including clinicians. Managers spend their time developing new policies and altering existing policies, as well as handling accounting needs and overseeing the facility. Smaller healthcare facilities may merge administrators and managers, creating a team that works together to address staffing, accounting and facilities management.",

            "passage": "As an example, immediately following the storm, I briefly sat in the FEMA Operations Center. A call came in for temporary housing. Racking my brain for atypical sources, since all the typical ones were either underwater or already engaged, I came up with real estate management firms. I called one of the largest. They said, “Love to help, but we manage office space. We can’t convert that to housing. Sorry.” Weeks later, I relayed this story to a local NGO in New Jersey. The poor woman’s head nearly exploded in frustration, “Argh! We needed office space for staging areas!” She hadn’t thought to ask for office space from businesses, and even if she had, chances are slim that her request would have surfaced to me in DC. Now, it is true that systems like Aidmatrixexist and act as big spreadsheets in the sky for cataloging needs, especially for product donations. Those systems have their own advantages and disadvantages and smart people are hard at work trying to improve them. But even those plans won’t address several core challenges. First, at a basic level, we need systems for dealing with services, skills-based volunteers, and directed cash donations. To deal with part of this challenge BCLC has partnered with National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disasters (NVOAD) to launch a Disaster Recovery Aid Portal for these specific needs. More fundamentally, however, we also need a bit of rapid human intervention. My Dean Witter broker, back when I was in eighth grade, did more than just match cells on a spreadsheet. He helped broker high-value relationships by understanding both the buyer’s and seller’s needs. The same thing is needed for disaster recovery and rebuilding. The BCLC\/NVOAD portal will do some of that by inserting an actual human being into the posting\/matching process to ensure the needs from NGOs and governments are expressed in a way that a company can respond to. We also need a broader conversation about the role of businesses in disaster rebuilding and recovery. It has become increasingly common practice for companies like UPS and FedEx or Walmart and Target to embed in emergency management operations centers so they can coordinate with the governments and bring their supply chains to bear immediately following a disaster. That kind of partnership needs to extend beyond immediate relief efforts and security issues (so called “first response”) to the medium-term issues of rebuilding and long-term recovery (“second response”). Doing that will help breakdown several cultural and institutional barriers that currently impede long-term recovery. On the cultural side, many people in NGOs and governments inherently distrust business. Part of that is inherent to their position: they have to keep potential vendors at arm’s-length to avoid compromising the procurement process. But it also comes from a knee-jerk suspicion of the motives of the private sector. On the other side, businesses, like the rest of us, have short attention spans. While they’re willing to open their wallets in the immediate aftermath, once things leave the front page, their interest and giving often wanes. Which is a shame, because if anyone has the know-how to solve these long-term issues, it’s business. We need to simultaneously better educate NGOs and governments on how to work with businesses and raise awareness among companies of the roles they can play in a long-term solution. Governments and NGOs shouldn’t be naïve in selecting partners, as there will always be bad actors, but they need to learn how to separate the good from the bad. And businesses need to give smarter, focusing their resources on the problems they can uniquely solve. Disasters, like many other problems, are beset by silos. Government agencies work in their lanes, NGOs in theirs. Businesses, same story. “Outcome brokers aren’t slowed down by silos. Instead, they’re focused and designed to solve problems,” says Frank DiGiammarino. An outcome broker for disaster recovery would cut across these different sectors and craft hyper-local solutions, drawing on the vast institutional resources from each. I haven’t cracked the code on what an outcome broker would look like for disaster recovery, but drawing on lessons from other models, here are some attributes:\n- Cross-sector governance. The major parties — businesses, governments, and NGOs — need equal seats at the table.",

These types of injuries can range from small cuts and lacerations to life-altering damage and can be costly for both a company and its employees. Accidents and injuries can lead to increased employee time away from work, lost productivity, and even a physical inability to return to work at all. Here are 5 ways to help you and your workers stay safe in Automotive environments:\n1. Identify Your Risk\nIt is important to know what risks you are exposed to in your working environment. These risks can vary with application and can range from cut and abrasion to chemical and oil, even to electrical, heat or impact-related risks. Familiarize yourself with the tools, materials and surroundings in which you are exposed. By identifying all environmental hazards, you can effectively protect your team from dangerous situations, ultimately reducing the number of potential accidents and resulting injuries. 2. Choose the Correct PPE\nWe all know cost factors into the decision-making process of purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE). However, you never want to sacrifice protection for price. Three questions you should always ask yourself when choosing the correct PPE for your team are:\nI. Is my team protected from the surrounding environmental risks? II. Is my team receiving the level of protection necessary to complete their tasks safely? For example, a task that requires Cut Level A7 protection is very different than a task that requires Cut Level A2 protection. III. Are my team members wearing the right sized-gloves? Workers are more inclined to remove their hand protection and expose their bare hands to environmental risks due to wearing ill-fitting gloves. Eliminate these chances by ensuring your team is wearing the correct sized gloves at all times. 3. Remove All Jewelry\nWearing jewelry in an Automotive Manufacturing environment is a major safety hazard and can result in very serious injuries. These injuries can include cuts, amputations, even electric shock! Note, the term “jewelry” is not limited to earrings, bracelets and necklaces. It also includes jewelry which may be covered by clothing such as ankle bracelets, toe rings and body piercings, or fit snug against your skin such as rings or stud earrings. Remove all jewelry before entering your working environment to save your limbs and your life! 4. Identify Safety Features on Machinery & Power Tools\nBefore using any machinery equipment or power tool, ensure that you have a full understanding of the available safety features and how they function. It’s always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared when it comes to using a piece of equipment where one accident could have life-altering consequences. 5. Stay Alert\nOnce familiarized with or accustomed to daily tasks and responsibilities, it is easy to fall into autopilot mode as you go about your day. The most simple and effective way to keep your hands safe and protected is to always be aware of your surroundings and stay focused on the task at hand. Accidents happen. But with the correct PPE and safety protocols in place, these accidents can happen less frequently and lead to a safer and more prepared workforce.\n\nPPE keeps workers safe when performing the following assembly tasks:\n- Adjusting small parts and screws\n- Assembling bolts\n- Assembling chassis\n- Assembling components like dashboards, panels, and seats\n- Assembling electrical components and wire harnesses\n- Assembling finished products\n- Assembling parts\n- Attaching cables\n- Body trimming\n- Connecting devices\n- Connecting wire harnesses\n- Constructing finished products\n- Fastening components and parts\n- Feeling fine parts\n- Screwing, tightening, and clamping of parts\n- Installing electronics and wiring\n- Installing carpet, door pads, door mechanisms, and headliners\n- Loading components on the line\n- Moving heavy parts and items from bulk containers, racks, shelves, or in bins\n- Position components such as motors, gear boxes, drive trains in and on machine frame\n- Pushing carts and totes\n- Set up, fit, and bolt place large parts such as frames, brackets\n- Using a wide range of tools (This task is a major source of cut and puncture injuries, as identified in previous blogs.)

It outlines the dangerous tasks that workers in this field face every day. This is why wearing the right PPE is so critical and why MCR Safety works hard to match the right PPE to the job. Potential Assembly Hazards\nMetal and cut hazards are abound in automotive assembly, which is why workers in this industry need to protect their hands and arms. Almost everywhere you look in automotive assembly, workers come into contact with metal. One nick against freshly welded metal can cause serious injury to a worker. Arm protection is a critical piece of PPE worn in automotive manufacturing. Beyond cut injuries, automotive manufacturing employees come in contact with many hazards. Every day these men and women work around lubricants, brake fluid, oil and grease; lifting heavy objects; touching and inspecting metal that may have sharp or jagged edges; welding sparks; flying objects; and a variety of other dangers. Our Automotive industry page provides deeper insight into the hazards workers in this industry face and what PPE products to consider. Finding the Right Glove for Assembly Work\nWorker accuracy and speed are two areas of high importance when assembling components. This means choosing the right glove is extremely important, as a worker can’t afford downtime or limited hand movement when screwing in bolts, nuts, or parts. Their takt time will suffer! When choosing the right assembly gloves for your needs, you definitely need to consider the cut protection offered and the dip:\n- Cut-Resistant Gloves\nYou want to pay attention to the cut-resistance properties of any PPE that you purchase, including gloves and sleeves. As previously mentioned, sharp metal is everywhere in automotive plants. Our Cut Protection page provides a tool to help you quickly find the right gloves based on specific cut scores.

There are numerous areas that cables have to be applied for things to work out as they should. At times, wires can get messy; they can leave things looking untidy and unkempt. When cables are not installed and managed the right way, the chances are that they may end up not functioning as they should. When you are in an industry that requires the use of numerous cables, you have to make sure that their installation and other services to them is done to the level best and with the right technology. Human is to error, and mostly, with such a manual duty of handling cables, there are chances that things might get faulty or lack a lasting installation touch. It is, therefore, best to work with a cable handling equipment, because then, you can be sure that things will work out in perfection and there is barely anything that will be left out unattended. Your work will also be more comfortable because the functionality of a machine can never be compared to human duty. There is wire handling equipment that is in the market today, and they are the best option for you when you want things to run better. You may come across various options that you can work with, but you have to make sure that you invest in the best. Get to know more about how you can go about the purchase of cable handling equipment with ease and get the best. The most important thing is making sure that you are getting the best equipment. There may be several types of equipment where all have different functionality when you are not sure of how each of the functions, it is best if you would get guidance towards understanding how they function. Identify your needs, and then go to the market with the essentials in mind. When you are trying to achieve your goal, you will most probably manage to get the right equipment. It is wise if you would also look into any future needs you may have with your cabling, and have the equipment you purchase to be capable of taking care of it all. You will have saved yourself another hassle in the future when you pick a machine that will accommodate expansions in the future. Secondly, verify the company that has produced the equipment you purchase. It is wise to get equipment from a known company. When a company has a good reputation for providing excellent equipment for these purposes, you can go with them since other people trust their work. Make sure also that their products have a mark of quality and that their company is licensed. To be sure of how effective their equipment would be by checking out feedback from other users, you can either get recommendations or use the web to check reviews. Lastly, check out the cost of the equipment. Depending on your budget, make sure that you work with a machine that is affordable for you. Ensure that you get the warrant policy before taking it away, then you can be sure that in cases of anything, you are safe.\n\nOn the one hand, this is obviously a great choice when it comes to selecting sturdy cabling options. On the other hand, if you ever need to cut those wires for any reason, traditional wire cutters may not be strong enough to handle the task. That is where aircraft cable cutters come in. These cable cutters tend towards the heavy duty side of the spectrum, and can thus cut through aircraft cables. What’s more, they are typically able to do this without ripping or shearing the cable in question. This is good, because doing so can leave jagged edges, which can be dangerous and highly undesirable. Why You Need a Quality Cable Cutter\nIf you work in either the electrical or carpentry industry, cable or wire cutters are likely necessary for performing some of the basic duties of your work. If you work as an electrician, you are going to need a cable cutter which is capable of stripping wires. This is necessary for all manner of different rewiring projects. In addition, you are going to want cable cutters which can cut through electrical wires. Not all cable cutters are capable of doing this in a safe manner. As such, you should always read the description to see whether the cable cutters in question are insulated and cleared for cutting live wires. Then there are cable cutters which are intended for use by carpenters. These can be a great choice for cutting through copper and aluminum, as is often required by both carpenters as well as electricians. In addition, certain cable cutters are designed to be able to cut through steel. They tend to require a lot more strength than your average cable cutter, however, so it is advisable to read ahead of time to see whether a given unit is capable of this. Finally, cable cutters are necessary for achieving quick, clean cuts through all manner of metal surfaces. This is especially necessary when it comes to a material such as aircraft cable. As such, specialized aircraft cable cutters are highly important for electricians and carpenters alike. Finally, there is the fact that cable cutters are able to cut through strong metal materials with a greater degree of precision than most other alternatives. If you need to make incisive, accurate cuts, cable cutters are likely going to be required. For all of these reasons, it is essential to have one or more pairs of cable cutters which can cut through copper, aluminum, steel, and electrical wires. What’s the Best Way to Cut Steel Cable Cleanly? The short answer here is, as established, to use the best aircraft cable cutter to get the job done. The longer answer is to choose the right cable cutter for the job and to make sure you are applying force in such a way as to cut the metal wiring in question without ripping it. Rough, ripping motions can cause tearing, which in turn can cause jagged edges, which can pose a safety hazard and a real headache for jobs which require clean cuts through metal wiring. One of the most important things to take into consideration when it comes to cutting steel cleanly is the ability to lock the unit into place. You do not want the jaws to move around all over the place while cutting. It is thus vital that you find aircraft cable cutters which are able to lock into place. Certain cable cutters are able to be locked into place by turning a nut or knob. In addition, you are going to want to make sure that you buy cable cutters which are able to cut through steel. Cable cutters which are capable of cutting through steel will typically say that they are able to cut through galvanized materials.\n\nFor every task there is a proper tool, but which tool is best for the task at hand? That’s the question which anyone who uses tools faces. Whether for pilots, bike mechanics, DIY, professional work, or what have you, cable cutters are a vital part of any toolbox – but which one is right for you? Today we review 11 cable cutters that cut without fraying. Choosing the best aircraft cable cutter is going to depend a great deal on the job that you wish to accomplish. Cable cutters come in all shapes and sizes, from small ones for intricate work to large options that can cut through huge ropes of steel. With that in mind, let’s take a look at different types of wire cutters and help you figure out which ones are right for your next big job. The Different Types of Wire Cutters\nOne of the most challenging things about wire cutters is the fact that they are simple in concept yet more various in style than might first be supposed. The basic idea of a tool that can cut through metal wires and bands is easy to grasp, but what about all the nuance that comes with that? What about different lengths and thicknesses of metal wiring? What if it the wires are electrical in nature? What about wires which require a careful balance between strength and delicacy? For all of these options, there are different types of wire cutters which take the basic idea of a tool for cutting through metal bands and reinvent it for the specific challenges at hand. Some of the most common and important types of wire cutters to add to your toolbox include the following:\n- Linemen’s Wire Cutters: These are used for jobs such as those performed by electricians and linemen working on power lines with need for a wire stripper. They can be used to cut through or strip wires, have insulated handles to protect users from electrical shocks, and feature sharp edges for cutting purposes. - Locking Wire Cutters: Whereas lineman’s wire cutters are often used by electricians and linemen for stripping wires, these are often used by carpenters for use on sheets of metal. They feature locks which make them easier to set into place for that purpose. - Needle Nose Wire Cutter: These are among the narrowest wire cutters on this list. They are used in instances where when extra-fine wires or working in small spaces is involved. In addition, they are often used for cutting electrical wires and so likewise feature insulated handles to protect against shocks. - Diagonal Cutting Wire Cutters: As the name implies, they feature diamond-shaped edges, can be used to cut through wire as well as metal, and are used by carpenters as well as electricians, making them something of a jack of all trades and one of the most versatile options on this list. - Round Nose Wire Cutters: These wires feature rounded nose ends and tend to be used for more delicate work, such as bending as well as cutting thinner wiring or strips of metal. With those distinctions in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best examples of different types of cable cutters on the market. Best Aircraft Cable Cutters\n1.

In all, 4.4 million people require medical attention each year as a result of a road accident. it goes without saying that the more safety features a vehicle has, the better chance you and your passengers have against injury in the event of a crash. With modern advances in technology, driving has become much safer. Keep reading to find out three new car safety features that should be essential for your next vehicle. 1. AEB: Automatic Emergency Braking\nAEB or Automatic Emergency Braking has become more sought after in recent years, as modern advances happen in the automotive industry. A vehicle that has AEB fitted will automatically sense a potential collision, and if the driver does not react in time, the car will do the braking on your behalf. A driver will find that in the event of a collision, the car will be able to commence braking before the driver has even had time to react, drastically reducing the severity of the collision itself. 2. The Rear-View Camera\nThere are two main benefits to having a rear-view camera on your car:\n- The driver gets a clear view of anything that is behind the vehicle while reversing\n- The rear-view camera can detect objects, people, or animals that are too short to be seen over the backend of the car\nThese rear-view cameras usually have a 180-degree backward view, so a driver will be able to see on the screen any obstructions behind them. 3. Futuristic Facial Recognition\nVery recently, some car manufacturers have revealed vehicles that have facial recognition software installed. What does this mean? Well, the facial recognition software has the ability to constantly measure the driver’s alertness, as well as give warnings when it feels that the driver isn’t paying enough attention. The warning comes in the form of a buzzer with the objective of bringing the driver’s attention back to the wheel. Bonus New Car Safety Features\nCar safety features come in the form of many vehicle advancements, particularly in recent years. Some of these we feel are worthy of a special mention:\n- Smart headlights have the ability to lower the level of the light beam when it senses oncoming traffic, so other drivers aren’t ‘blinded’\n- Night vision features are also available that will serve as a warning system for pedestrians and cyclists that aren’t easily seen at night\nIf you do find yourself in the difficult position of having recently had a road collision, make sure you’re up to scratch with the requirements and things that need to be done. Sweet Law is an organization that can assist with this. Shopping For New Car Safety Features\nWhen you’re in the market for a new vehicle, new car safety features should be top of the list of what you need to look at. You can also look for things like forward-collision warning systems, shatter-resistant glass, and airbags, all of which are dated technology, but coupled with new advancements can make your new vehicle as safe as possible.

            "passage": "When it comes to the cutting operations to make power cables, safety is key. That’s why Rittmeyer, a German-based precision engineering company, utilizes a high-tech, coax shielding cutting device called the BERI.CO.CUT. To make operation of this electro-pneumatic machine safer, Rittmeyer integrated ACE shock absorbers and clamping elements into its design. End Position Protection. The BERI.CO.CUT precision-cuts the shielding and braids cables used in electric and hybrid vehicles. As the cables are being worked on, the head of the machine moves. To protect operating personnel and the machine itself, Rittmeyer, along with ACE specialists, selected miniature format MC75EUM-3 shock absorbers. These maintenance-free, hydraulic elements ensure gentle impact of the head against the rear pane, preventing costly damage to both the head and overall structure. And with a net weight of only 30 grams, a length of 70 mm and a reset time of 0.3 seconds, ACE shock absorbers far exceeded the cable cutting machine’s compact requirements. Pneumatic Rod Clamping. In addition to the shock absorbers, Rittmeyer selected ACE LOCKED PN clamping elements to use in its cable cutting machine. These components are designed to immediately clamp in the event the machine loses pressure as it moves concentrically along two guide shafts, protecting both the operators and the machine itself. They also prevent movement during the cutting process—a critical function, as even the slightest cutting inaccuracy can have serious repercussions in automotive or aerospace applications. Suitable for rods with diameters of 20 to 40 mm, LOCKED PN clamping elements absorb forces axially and rotationally. With a holding force of up to 36,000 N, they also reach or exceed the levels of hydraulic clamps without the high cost.",

            "passage": "To explore hazards specific to automotive and request more information on how to make Ansell your safety partner, start here\nHand-related injuries are one of the most common forms of worker injures in Automotive Manufacturing environments. These types of injuries can range from small cuts and lacerations to life-altering damage and can be costly for both a company and its employees. Accidents and injuries can lead to increased employee time away from work, lost productivity, and even a physical inability to return to work at all. Here are 5 ways to help you and your workers stay safe in Automotive environments:\n1. Identify Your Risk\nIt is important to know what risks you are exposed to in your working environment. These risks can vary with application and can range from cut and abrasion to chemical and oil, even to electrical, heat or impact-related risks. Familiarize yourself with the tools, materials and surroundings in which you are exposed. By identifying all environmental hazards, you can effectively protect your team from dangerous situations, ultimately reducing the number of potential accidents and resulting injuries. 2. Choose the Correct PPE\nWe all know cost factors into the decision-making process of purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE). However, you never want to sacrifice protection for price. Three questions you should always ask yourself when choosing the correct PPE for your team are:\nI. Is my team protected from the surrounding environmental risks? II. Is my team receiving the level of protection necessary to complete their tasks safely? For example, a task that requires Cut Level A7 protection is very different than a task that requires Cut Level A2 protection. III. Are my team members wearing the right sized-gloves? Workers are more inclined to remove their hand protection and expose their bare hands to environmental risks due to wearing ill-fitting gloves. Eliminate these chances by ensuring your team is wearing the correct sized gloves at all times. 3. Remove All Jewelry\nWearing jewelry in an Automotive Manufacturing environment is a major safety hazard and can result in very serious injuries. These injuries can include cuts, amputations, even electric shock! Note, the term “jewelry” is not limited to earrings, bracelets and necklaces. It also includes jewelry which may be covered by clothing such as ankle bracelets, toe rings and body piercings, or fit snug against your skin such as rings or stud earrings. Remove all jewelry before entering your working environment to save your limbs and your life! 4. Identify Safety Features on Machinery & Power Tools\nBefore using any machinery equipment or power tool, ensure that you have a full understanding of the available safety features and how they function. It’s always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared when it comes to using a piece of equipment where one accident could have life-altering consequences. 5. Stay Alert\nOnce familiarized with or accustomed to daily tasks and responsibilities, it is easy to fall into autopilot mode as you go about your day. The most simple and effective way to keep your hands safe and protected is to always be aware of your surroundings and stay focused on the task at hand. Accidents happen. But with the correct PPE and safety protocols in place, these accidents can happen less frequently and lead to a safer and more prepared workforce.",

What’s more, they are typically able to do this without ripping or shearing the cable in question. This is good, because doing so can leave jagged edges, which can be dangerous and highly undesirable. Why You Need a Quality Cable Cutter\nIf you work in either the electrical or carpentry industry, cable or wire cutters are likely necessary for performing some of the basic duties of your work. If you work as an electrician, you are going to need a cable cutter which is capable of stripping wires. This is necessary for all manner of different rewiring projects. In addition, you are going to want cable cutters which can cut through electrical wires. Not all cable cutters are capable of doing this in a safe manner. As such, you should always read the description to see whether the cable cutters in question are insulated and cleared for cutting live wires. Then there are cable cutters which are intended for use by carpenters. These can be a great choice for cutting through copper and aluminum, as is often required by both carpenters as well as electricians. In addition, certain cable cutters are designed to be able to cut through steel. They tend to require a lot more strength than your average cable cutter, however, so it is advisable to read ahead of time to see whether a given unit is capable of this. Finally, cable cutters are necessary for achieving quick, clean cuts through all manner of metal surfaces. This is especially necessary when it comes to a material such as aircraft cable. As such, specialized aircraft cable cutters are highly important for electricians and carpenters alike. Finally, there is the fact that cable cutters are able to cut through strong metal materials with a greater degree of precision than most other alternatives. If you need to make incisive, accurate cuts, cable cutters are likely going to be required. For all of these reasons, it is essential to have one or more pairs of cable cutters which can cut through copper, aluminum, steel, and electrical wires. What’s the Best Way to Cut Steel Cable Cleanly? The short answer here is, as established, to use the best aircraft cable cutter to get the job done. The longer answer is to choose the right cable cutter for the job and to make sure you are applying force in such a way as to cut the metal wiring in question without ripping it. Rough, ripping motions can cause tearing, which in turn can cause jagged edges, which can pose a safety hazard and a real headache for jobs which require clean cuts through metal wiring. One of the most important things to take into consideration when it comes to cutting steel cleanly is the ability to lock the unit into place. You do not want the jaws to move around all over the place while cutting. It is thus vital that you find aircraft cable cutters which are able to lock into place. Certain cable cutters are able to be locked into place by turning a nut or knob. In addition, you are going to want to make sure that you buy cable cutters which are able to cut through steel. Cable cutters which are capable of cutting through steel will typically say that they are able to cut through galvanized materials.",

            "passage": "For every task there is a proper tool, but which tool is best for the task at hand? That’s the question which anyone who uses tools faces. Whether for pilots, bike mechanics, DIY, professional work, or what have you, cable cutters are a vital part of any toolbox – but which one is right for you? Today we review 11 cable cutters that cut without fraying. Choosing the best aircraft cable cutter is going to depend a great deal on the job that you wish to accomplish. Cable cutters come in all shapes and sizes, from small ones for intricate work to large options that can cut through huge ropes of steel. With that in mind, let’s take a look at different types of wire cutters and help you figure out which ones are right for your next big job. The Different Types of Wire Cutters\nOne of the most challenging things about wire cutters is the fact that they are simple in concept yet more various in style than might first be supposed. The basic idea of a tool that can cut through metal wires and bands is easy to grasp, but what about all the nuance that comes with that? What about different lengths and thicknesses of metal wiring? What if it the wires are electrical in nature? What about wires which require a careful balance between strength and delicacy? For all of these options, there are different types of wire cutters which take the basic idea of a tool for cutting through metal bands and reinvent it for the specific challenges at hand. Some of the most common and important types of wire cutters to add to your toolbox include the following:\n- Linemen’s Wire Cutters: These are used for jobs such as those performed by electricians and linemen working on power lines with need for a wire stripper. They can be used to cut through or strip wires, have insulated handles to protect users from electrical shocks, and feature sharp edges for cutting purposes. - Locking Wire Cutters: Whereas lineman’s wire cutters are often used by electricians and linemen for stripping wires, these are often used by carpenters for use on sheets of metal. They feature locks which make them easier to set into place for that purpose. - Needle Nose Wire Cutter: These are among the narrowest wire cutters on this list. They are used in instances where when extra-fine wires or working in small spaces is involved. In addition, they are often used for cutting electrical wires and so likewise feature insulated handles to protect against shocks. - Diagonal Cutting Wire Cutters: As the name implies, they feature diamond-shaped edges, can be used to cut through wire as well as metal, and are used by carpenters as well as electricians, making them something of a jack of all trades and one of the most versatile options on this list. - Round Nose Wire Cutters: These wires feature rounded nose ends and tend to be used for more delicate work, such as bending as well as cutting thinner wiring or strips of metal. With those distinctions in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best examples of different types of cable cutters on the market. Best Aircraft Cable Cutters\n1.

            "passage": "Did you know that road accidents are the leading cause of death for U.S. citizens aged one year old to 54 years old? In all, 4.4 million people require medical attention each year as a result of a road accident. it goes without saying that the more safety features a vehicle has, the better chance you and your passengers have against injury in the event of a crash. With modern advances in technology, driving has become much safer. Keep reading to find out three new car safety features that should be essential for your next vehicle. 1. AEB: Automatic Emergency Braking\nAEB or Automatic Emergency Braking has become more sought after in recent years, as modern advances happen in the automotive industry. A vehicle that has AEB fitted will automatically sense a potential collision, and if the driver does not react in time, the car will do the braking on your behalf. A driver will find that in the event of a collision, the car will be able to commence braking before the driver has even had time to react, drastically reducing the severity of the collision itself. 2. The Rear-View Camera\nThere are two main benefits to having a rear-view camera on your car:\n- The driver gets a clear view of anything that is behind the vehicle while reversing\n- The rear-view camera can detect objects, people, or animals that are too short to be seen over the backend of the car\nThese rear-view cameras usually have a 180-degree backward view, so a driver will be able to see on the screen any obstructions behind them. 3. Futuristic Facial Recognition\nVery recently, some car manufacturers have revealed vehicles that have facial recognition software installed. What does this mean? Well, the facial recognition software has the ability to constantly measure the driver’s alertness, as well as give warnings when it feels that the driver isn’t paying enough attention. The warning comes in the form of a buzzer with the objective of bringing the driver’s attention back to the wheel. Bonus New Car Safety Features\nCar safety features come in the form of many vehicle advancements, particularly in recent years. Some of these we feel are worthy of a special mention:\n- Smart headlights have the ability to lower the level of the light beam when it senses oncoming traffic, so other drivers aren’t ‘blinded’\n- Night vision features are also available that will serve as a warning system for pedestrians and cyclists that aren’t easily seen at night\nIf you do find yourself in the difficult position of having recently had a road collision, make sure you’re up to scratch with the requirements and things that need to be done. Sweet Law is an organization that can assist with this. Shopping For New Car Safety Features\nWhen you’re in the market for a new vehicle, new car safety features should be top of the list of what you need to look at. You can also look for things like forward-collision warning systems, shatter-resistant glass, and airbags, all of which are dated technology, but coupled with new advancements can make your new vehicle as safe as possible.

Here are my personal favourites:\n- New Orleans Ghost Tour\nThe Big Easy is often referred to as ‘the most haunted city in the USA’ and after a two-hour walk through the city you may be inclined to agree. New Orleans has enjoyed a colourful history that encompasses ghosts, vampires and voodoo. The tour includes a visit to a haunted bar. - Concrete Shoes on the Vegas Mob Tour\nTake a two-hour tour to discover the fascinating history of Las Vegas. Made famous by colourful characters of dubious reputation (think Bugsy Siegel and Anthony ‘the Ant’ Spilotro) Sin City is only 75 years old but has been built on skimming, suicide, murders and general underworld activities giving rise to an interesting reputation. - Creepy Beasties in Edinburgh\nTake a look at Edinburgh’s dark side, including tales of witchcraft, plague and torture. Visit the dark scenes of mayhem, horrific torture murders and supernatural happenings as you walk along eerie alleyways and creepy courtyards of the old Town. Beware of the “jumper-ooters”!!! - Scandalous Sydney\nEver wanted to ride in a haunted Cadillac hearse? Discover Sydney’s bizarre and bloody past, oozing with convicts, crime scenes, sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll, scandals, celebrities and much more. This “Weird Sydney” history and ghost tour is informative and will tell you everything you need to know about the famous and infamous who shaped the city. These tours are guaranteed to leave you with some spine chilling memories. Have you done any spooky tours around the world? I’d love to hear from you if you have.\n\nNew Orleans tours are exceedingly popular due in large part to the fact there is just too much to see in this city in one or two week’s time. Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.\n\nHappy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler! I thought it’d be fun to explore the most haunted Fat Tuesday\/Carnival cities that I could find. Dare to join me? Let’s indulge…\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nI think it’s safe to say that the first place that probably pops to most people’s minds if they live in the U.S. and hear “Mardi Gras” is New Orleans. As for haunted places? Yep. New Orleans is loaded with those too. In the French Quarter alone you can find a concentration of New Orleans’ most haunted places. I’m talking haunted hotels, haunted restaurants, even haunted cemeteries! Just a few of the many popular haunted hotels include the Andrew Jackson Hotel, Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, and\nBourbon Orleans Hotel. You’ll find everything from the ghosts of Confederate soldiers, a ghost maid who tucks guests in, and the ghosts of children who died in a fire. Ghosts aren’t the only haunting things you might encounter in this city either. Be on the lookout for vampires. As Stephen P. Unger once wrote in a guest post here, New Orleans’ vampire scene has been active for many, many decades. Centuries even. Ever since the city was first established. Anne Rice certainly had a lot to draw from for her beloved novels. And if you want to take a Mardi Gras, ghost, or vampire tour, Viator offers a bunch, such as:\n- Mardi Gras World: Behind-the-Scenes Tour in New Orleans\n- Mardi Gras Walking Tour in New Orleans\n- New Orleans Ghost Adventure\n- Murder in New Orleans Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Haunted History Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Ghosts and Spirits Walking Tour\n- French Quarter Haunted Excursion In New Orleans\n- New Orleans Supernatural Tour\n- New Orleans Voodoo Mystery and Paranormal Tour\n- French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour of New Orleans\n- Haunted History Of New Orleans\n- Ghostly Galavant New Orleans\n- New Orleans Vampire Tour\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nAnother huge Mardi Gras –or, rather, Carnival— hot spot is Brazil’s Rio. As for being haunted…well, that’s not among its claims to fame. There are a lot of haunting stories about the real life struggles of living there (especially in the favelas), but no real ghost accounts like what I’m looking for. However, it’s such an iconic Mardi Gras destination that to not include it would be blasphemous. So I searched hard and came up with one haunted place to share. Not far from Rio is the Imperial Museum in Petropolis. (It’s also known as the Petropolis Museum.) Allegedly the ghost of Emperor Dom Pedros II haunts its garden. (It used to be the Emperor’s favorite residence.) Viator even offers a tour there:\nAnother iconic Carnival hot spot is Venice. Mysterious, beguiling, and enchanting, this Italian City of Love is famous for its canals, culture and architecture. But it does possess a dark side. And seems to have its fair share of curses. (Which caught my eye, because of my recently released Shadow People and Cursed Objects: 13 Tales of Terror Based on True Stories…or are they? anthology.) Some feel sure that the Cà Dario, or Palazzo Dario, is cursed. After all, death has befallen all who have owned it. The Casin degli spiriti is a palace that is also regarded as a cursed location. It includes tales ranging from spirit and demon-invoking religious sects who practiced there to a heartbroken suicidal ghost who still roams there. Fishermen won’t fish in that lagoon because of a horrible murder in the 1950s where the killer chopped the victim’s body up before throwing the remains in those waters. And then there’s the very creepy Poveglia Island. Another place fisherman don’t dare go near for fear it’s cursed. It’s a 10 minute ferry ride from Venice and was home to Black Death victims during the plague epidemic. Centuries later it became a psychiatric hospital run by a doctor who tortured the patients. He went mad himself and committed suicide after claiming to be haunted by the island’s ghosts. 160,000 deaths are said to have occurred there.\n\nNola Tour Guy is a proud member of thee Free Tour Community, find out more: https:\/\/freetourcommunity.com\/.

Join us, you won’t be disappointed..\n\nNew Orleans is probably best known for its French Quarter (after Mardi Gras, of course), so we couldn’t go to New Orleans without visiting that area! My mom and I actually went every day we were in New Orleans (we couldn’t get enough of the beignets! ), and we did take a New Orleans French Quarter tour with Free Tours By Foot, which I highly recommend. I did enjoy all the colorful buildings in the French Quarter and the history was so interesting, but it was a little “grungier” than I expected. I never felt unsafe, but just be prepared for some dirt and puddles from construction and trash and bottles in the street in some areas. We stayed at Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery in the Warehouse District, but it was only about a fifteen minute walk to the French Quarter. If you’re visiting New Orleans and aren’t a fan of the nightlife, I recommend staying in the Warehouse District so you can get a good night’s sleep and also easily get to the French Quarter. After exploring the Warehouse District our first day there, we went to the French Quarter for dinner and a little exploring. And don’t worry, I have an entire post about all the amazing restaurants we went to in New Orleans! The Pontalba Buildings\nWe saw some pretty interesting sights! St. Louis Cathedral\nI loved all the balconies on the colorful buildings! French Quarter tour with Free Tours By Foot\nWe started the next day with a cemetery tour before going on our New Orleans French Quarter tour with Free Tours By Foot. We began in Jackson Square, which is one of the most famous spots in New Orleans. It’s a beautiful park surrounded by the St. Louis Cathedral, museums, and beautiful historic buildings. It’s also where we learned what I thought was the most interesting history of New Orleans about a baroness, and I’ll get into that fascinating story next. Our tour guide told us about Baroness de Pontalba, whose father was a successful developer in New Orleans, and after he died when she was young, she inherited his fortune. She married and moved to France and her new father-in-law was after her fortune, but after she kept refusing to give it to him, he shot Baroness de Pontalba four times before committing suicide. She apparently lost a few fingers but wore her injuries like a badge. Needless to say, her marriage didn’t work out and she returned to New Orleans where she built the Pontalba Buildings around Jackson Square. Now, the Pontalba Buildings house the oldest continuously-rented apartments in the U.S., and our guide told us you would have to wait at least three years before getting an apartment there! I had never heard of Baroness de Pontalba before, but I thought her history and impact on New Orleans was fascinating! Learning these interesting tidbits about places I travel is why I always love doing tours with locals. We learned that when the balcony is larger and supported with posts on the ground, it’s called a gallery, which were all over New Orleans. I loved seeing all the ornate designs and colors! Spanish history in New Orleans\nI was surprised to learn about the impact of the Spanish on New Orleans. I’ve only heard about the French impact, but the French Quarter seemed to be just as Spanish as French! New Orleans was French first and then it was owned by Spain for 40 years before the Louisiana purchase, and it changed nationalities three times in just a three year span! It was really interesting to see how all the cultures influenced New Orleans, and it’s one of the main things that makes New Orleans so unique. Our tour guide also told us about the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the area, and I thought it was interesting that there wasn’t much damage to the area because it’s closest to the river, but it was hard to get to the French Quarter because of all the floods surrounding it. And places like the famous restaurant Antoine’s lost things like their historic wine supply because the electricity was out for so long that it ruined all the wine. New Orleans is known for its voodoo culture, which I mentioned in my cemetery post since a voodoo priestess’s tomb kept getting vandalized. Apparently, voodoo practiced in New Orleans isn’t what you see in the movies and there aren’t curses and voodoo dolls resembling people, and it’s more of a spiritual religion that came from African religions.\n\nQuestion:I'm interested in the paranormal history of New Orleans - what guided tours would you recommend?",

While I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, the oldest bar in the United States located on Bourbon Street in the French Quarters of New Orleans.

From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.",

            "passage": "Happy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler! I thought it’d be fun to explore the most haunted Fat Tuesday\/Carnival cities that I could find. Dare to join me? Let’s indulge…\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nI think it’s safe to say that the first place that probably pops to most people’s minds if they live in the U.S. and hear “Mardi Gras” is New Orleans. As for haunted places? Yep. New Orleans is loaded with those too. In the French Quarter alone you can find a concentration of New Orleans’ most haunted places. I’m talking haunted hotels, haunted restaurants, even haunted cemeteries! Just a few of the many popular haunted hotels include the Andrew Jackson Hotel, Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, and\nBourbon Orleans Hotel. You’ll find everything from the ghosts of Confederate soldiers, a ghost maid who tucks guests in, and the ghosts of children who died in a fire. Ghosts aren’t the only haunting things you might encounter in this city either. Be on the lookout for vampires. As Stephen P. Unger once wrote in a guest post here, New Orleans’ vampire scene has been active for many, many decades. Centuries even. Ever since the city was first established. Anne Rice certainly had a lot to draw from for her beloved novels. And if you want to take a Mardi Gras, ghost, or vampire tour, Viator offers a bunch, such as:\n- Mardi Gras World: Behind-the-Scenes Tour in New Orleans\n- Mardi Gras Walking Tour in New Orleans\n- New Orleans Ghost Adventure\n- Murder in New Orleans Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Haunted History Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Ghosts and Spirits Walking Tour\n- French Quarter Haunted Excursion In New Orleans\n- New Orleans Supernatural Tour\n- New Orleans Voodoo Mystery and Paranormal Tour\n- French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour of New Orleans\n- Haunted History Of New Orleans\n- Ghostly Galavant New Orleans\n- New Orleans Vampire Tour\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nAnother huge Mardi Gras –or, rather, Carnival— hot spot is Brazil’s Rio. As for being haunted…well, that’s not among its claims to fame. There are a lot of haunting stories about the real life struggles of living there (especially in the favelas), but no real ghost accounts like what I’m looking for. However, it’s such an iconic Mardi Gras destination that to not include it would be blasphemous. So I searched hard and came up with one haunted place to share. Not far from Rio is the Imperial Museum in Petropolis. (It’s also known as the Petropolis Museum.) Allegedly the ghost of Emperor Dom Pedros II haunts its garden. (It used to be the Emperor’s favorite residence.) Viator even offers a tour there:\nAnother iconic Carnival hot spot is Venice. Mysterious, beguiling, and enchanting, this Italian City of Love is famous for its canals, culture and architecture. But it does possess a dark side. And seems to have its fair share of curses. (Which caught my eye, because of my recently released Shadow People and Cursed Objects: 13 Tales of Terror Based on True Stories…or are they? anthology.) Some feel sure that the Cà Dario, or Palazzo Dario, is cursed. After all, death has befallen all who have owned it. The Casin degli spiriti is a palace that is also regarded as a cursed location. It includes tales ranging from spirit and demon-invoking religious sects who practiced there to a heartbroken suicidal ghost who still roams there. Fishermen won’t fish in that lagoon because of a horrible murder in the 1950s where the killer chopped the victim’s body up before throwing the remains in those waters. And then there’s the very creepy Poveglia Island. Another place fisherman don’t dare go near for fear it’s cursed. It’s a 10 minute ferry ride from Venice and was home to Black Death victims during the plague epidemic. Centuries later it became a psychiatric hospital run by a doctor who tortured the patients. He went mad himself and committed suicide after claiming to be haunted by the island’s ghosts. 160,000 deaths are said to have occurred there.",

            "passage": "New Orleans is probably best known for its French Quarter (after Mardi Gras, of course), so we couldn’t go to New Orleans without visiting that area! My mom and I actually went every day we were in New Orleans (we couldn’t get enough of the beignets! ), and we did take a New Orleans French Quarter tour with Free Tours By Foot, which I highly recommend. I did enjoy all the colorful buildings in the French Quarter and the history was so interesting, but it was a little “grungier” than I expected. I never felt unsafe, but just be prepared for some dirt and puddles from construction and trash and bottles in the street in some areas. We stayed at Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery in the Warehouse District, but it was only about a fifteen minute walk to the French Quarter. If you’re visiting New Orleans and aren’t a fan of the nightlife, I recommend staying in the Warehouse District so you can get a good night’s sleep and also easily get to the French Quarter. After exploring the Warehouse District our first day there, we went to the French Quarter for dinner and a little exploring. And don’t worry, I have an entire post about all the amazing restaurants we went to in New Orleans! The Pontalba Buildings\nWe saw some pretty interesting sights! St. Louis Cathedral\nI loved all the balconies on the colorful buildings! French Quarter tour with Free Tours By Foot\nWe started the next day with a cemetery tour before going on our New Orleans French Quarter tour with Free Tours By Foot. We began in Jackson Square, which is one of the most famous spots in New Orleans. It’s a beautiful park surrounded by the St. Louis Cathedral, museums, and beautiful historic buildings. It’s also where we learned what I thought was the most interesting history of New Orleans about a baroness, and I’ll get into that fascinating story next. Our tour guide told us about Baroness de Pontalba, whose father was a successful developer in New Orleans, and after he died when she was young, she inherited his fortune. She married and moved to France and her new father-in-law was after her fortune, but after she kept refusing to give it to him, he shot Baroness de Pontalba four times before committing suicide. She apparently lost a few fingers but wore her injuries like a badge. Needless to say, her marriage didn’t work out and she returned to New Orleans where she built the Pontalba Buildings around Jackson Square. Now, the Pontalba Buildings house the oldest continuously-rented apartments in the U.S., and our guide told us you would have to wait at least three years before getting an apartment there! I had never heard of Baroness de Pontalba before, but I thought her history and impact on New Orleans was fascinating! Learning these interesting tidbits about places I travel is why I always love doing tours with locals. We learned that when the balcony is larger and supported with posts on the ground, it’s called a gallery, which were all over New Orleans. I loved seeing all the ornate designs and colors! Spanish history in New Orleans\nI was surprised to learn about the impact of the Spanish on New Orleans. I’ve only heard about the French impact, but the French Quarter seemed to be just as Spanish as French! New Orleans was French first and then it was owned by Spain for 40 years before the Louisiana purchase, and it changed nationalities three times in just a three year span! It was really interesting to see how all the cultures influenced New Orleans, and it’s one of the main things that makes New Orleans so unique. Our tour guide also told us about the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the area, and I thought it was interesting that there wasn’t much damage to the area because it’s closest to the river, but it was hard to get to the French Quarter because of all the floods surrounding it. And places like the famous restaurant Antoine’s lost things like their historic wine supply because the electricity was out for so long that it ruined all the wine. New Orleans is known for its voodoo culture, which I mentioned in my cemetery post since a voodoo priestess’s tomb kept getting vandalized. Apparently, voodoo practiced in New Orleans isn’t what you see in the movies and there aren’t curses and voodoo dolls resembling people, and it’s more of a spiritual religion that came from African religions.",

Baños.",
    "answer": "Certainly! In 1997, Spain produced several notable short films. Here are some that stand out:\n\n1. **La Vaca Lechera** - Directed by Mariano Agudo & Julio Sánchez. This film was one of the highlights from the Spanish short film scene at the time, known for its innovative storytelling and unique style.\n\n2. **Historia de los Fluidos** - Directed by David Cantero & Gervasio Iglesias. This film delves into the surreal and the absurd, showcasing the creative prowess of its directors.\n\n3. **Hola Soy John Ford y Hago Películas** - Directed by Daniello Mortimore. This film offers a playful take on the film industry, blending humor with commentary on the art of filmmaking.\n\n4. **El Ladrón de Sueños** - Directed by Alberto Rodríguez. Known for his work in both short and feature films, Rodríguez presents a visually striking and thought-provoking narrative.\n\n5. **Welcome to Spain** - Directed by Carlos Atanes. This film, part of \"Codex Atanicus,\" is known for its surrealistic and often unsettling imagery, pushing the boundaries of traditional storytelling.\n\nEach of these films offers a unique perspective and contributes to the rich tapestry of Spanish cinema. If you're interested in exploring more, consider looking into film festivals from that period or online platforms that showcase classic short films.",

The three shorts, \"Metaminds & Metabodies\", \"Morfing\" and \"Welcome to Spain\" will take you into a movie universe few people have found before. I didn't know what I was getting into when I contacted Carlos Atanes about getting a screener for his DVD collection \"Codex Atanicus\". I've seen plenty of surreal\/art house films and I wasn't really expecting to be surprised. Shocked even. Not at graphic violence or violation, but at how different Carlos Atanes' movies are to anything I've ever seen. He has a certain way to confuse the flying fuck out of me, while still keeping me interested in whatever messed up situation is playing on the screen in front of me. I don't understand what he is trying to say, and I don't understand how he comes up with it, but I'm impressed. The first short on the DVD, \"Metaminds & Metabodies\" is really hard to dissect and go through in detail. It's all taking place in a bar that is suppose to represent the waiting room for Hell... somehow, and it starts out with something that seems like a live performance where a girl is singing some strange song while being hooked into the wall through barbed wire. Meanwhile, a man is threatening her that he will eat a contract. Like I said, it first seemed like a live performance in the bar, but that kinda changed when the man gets shot after eating the contract and whatnot. Don't ask me what kind of contract it is, 'cause I don't know. Following scenes seemed pretty much random but I'm sure that Carlos Atanes had a point in all of this, and I would love to find out some day, but right now it all just seemed like random ideas put together. But, it offered some twisted moments, some gore and some naked chicks, so even if you don't understand what's going on, there's still some odd pleasures to find in this movie. Moving over to the next short, \"Morfing\", and not really sure where to start on this one. The... ehum.. story, I suppose.. is alot easier to follow than in \"Metaminds & Metabodies\", but this is still nothing less than a huge \"what the fuck?\"-moment. It's basicly about a girl who has a camera man following her while she follows the director of these films, Carlos Atanes (yes, THESE films) while he is trying to get his new film \"Morfing\" into production. However, before she gets to discuss the movie with him, she finds him in the bathroom trying to hang himself. After convincing him he might as well give it another go, they set out to find people who wants to finance his film, and people to star in it. All of this sounds fairly normal, but I assure you that dialogue and random things they meet (girl with an alien-ish arm, man who dies after getting a bloody baby thrown at him, and so on) make it all too weird to explain. The short ends with the actual film that they are trying to get into production, and well.. It's basicly a minute or two long, with some more of the typical Carlos Atanes mono\/dialogues and a shot of a girl getting drenched in what I think is suppose to be sperm. I really urge you to watch this movie as it's entertaining in both a strange way, and a highly comical way. \"Welcome To Spain\" is my least favorite of these three art house films, but that's not me saying it's a bad film. It's definitely another strange ride, and when the words written on the front cover, \"Three wild tales\" were written down, they weren't kidding. Here we have another innovative short from this Spanish director that gives you absolutely no clues as to what he is trying to say, but you're intrigued and you want to find out what the reason for these things are. I can't say much about \"Welcome To Spain\", than that. Going into details with a film that basicly ends in a huge fight in a stairway where one guy masturbates to a photo, one swallows a nail and gets it pierced through his chin, and a girl biting a man's ass, is just not possible. I'm gonna end this review with a well-deserved; WHAT THE FUCK?\n\nThe Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival took place the weekend of October 5 - 7 at the SIFF Film center and Uptown Theater. I wasn't able to attend all of the screenings, but I did get to see one feature film and two great shorts programs over the course of the weekend. Here are my thoughts on what I saw. The one feature film that I was able to catch was the opening night, midnight presentation of \"The Human Race\". To read my review CLICK HERE! The two blocks of shorts I was able to attend featured films from the science fiction and horror genres. There was a very diverse mix of styles, ideas, and concepts throughout each block and I was impressed with the overall quality on display. Below, you will see a brief synopsis for each of the shorts that, in my opinion, were the most memorable including my overall favorite which I saved for the very end. \"Appntmnt\" gives you a whole different way to look at those random people you see on the street in every day life. Does that homeless person over in the corner actually have a story to tell? If you know me at all, you understand how I believe that \"The Cabin in the Woods\" is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. Erik Gardner's \"Blue Hole\" gives yet another twist on the classic tale of people finding more than they bargained for out in the wilderness. This nine minute entry from Spain also screened this year at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Short Film Festival which was held at the world famous Cinerama theater. Director, Javier Chillón's short film is a highly entertaining and well deserved entry in to both festivals. Are you scared of clowns or do you love the way they make you laugh? Either way, \"Dorothy\" just might give you a whole new perspective in this blood soaked Australian short film from director Eros Romero. Margot Kidder stars in one of the more elaborate short films from this year's crop of selections. \"HENRi\" shows how an artificial intelligence can evolve and adapt over time under the most dire of circumstances. Thanks to Guillermo Del Toro, Spain has become a breeding ground for some very creative and truly scary horror stories. Out of everything I saw during MIFFF, Leyenda (Legend) was one of my favorites as it took a no holds barred approach that reminded me a lot of Del Toro's \"Pan's Labyrinth\", but still managed to hold its own and not fall into the dreaded copycat territory. Director Ryan Denmark has a very interesting sense of humor as \"Plush\" was easily one the funnier entries I had the pleasure of seeing. You may think twice about leaving that teddy bear on your bed after you see this movie which redefines what it means to be cute and cuddly. \"Velvet Road\" is a zombie period piece which shows what it might be like if a zombie outbreak happened during the 1960's. This actually turned out to be one of the more emotionally charged films as race, love, and the undead all come crashing together on a southern back road. BEST SHORT FILM\nBEST SHORT FILM\nWritten by and starring Marion Kerr, \"FAR\" was the one short film that stood out above all the rest. Director Brian Crewe has earned the distinction of creating the TwoOhSix.com \"Official Selection\" for Best Short Film at the Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival. CLICK HERE to check out my full review! Learn more about this amazing short film at FarShort.com!\n\nI'm getting a little embarrassed by the number of Spanish films I have been recommending in case anyone thinks I'm in the pay of the Spanish Film Board. Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nOld Joy - dir. Kelly Reichardt - 2006 - USA\nA heterosexual Brokeback Mountain? Sideways for realists? These are just a few comparisons I’ve heard made toward Old Joy, Kelly Reichardt’s second feature-length film after appearing briefly in Hal Hartley’s The Unbelievable Truth and working as a costume designer on Todd Haynes’ Poison. Neither comparison does her film justice, as the film is never particularly “heterosexual” and is far more wonderful than any comparison to the painfully overrated Sideways. Two men escape their differing personal lives to rekindle their friendship on a two-day camping trip. Mark (Daniel London) is about to become a father; he hasn’t seen his friend Kurt (Will Oldham) in what seems to be a long time. Their life paths appear to have taken separate directions, but, organized by Kurt, they embark on their nature excursion. Old Joy is hardly the “get lost to find yourself” film you’re afraid it might become (Sideways), but instead a powerfully acute depiction of personal relations. In an all-to-brief seventy-six minutes, Reichardt leaves you wanting more, and that’s her particular strength, other than creating a fully-alive atmosphere. Old Joy is snippets of conversation, shadows of backstory, and richly textured emotions that seem too much to fill up the running time. But, like most great films, Old Joy resonates with mystery and, especially, intrigue and stands as one of the finest cinematic experiences I’ve endured. The Secret Life of Words (La vida secreta de las palabras) - dir. Isabel Coixet - 2005 - Spain\nYou have to hand it to a director that, unlike so many of their peers, strays away from the falseness of beautiful imagery and composition. In her second film, Coixet paints her film in monochromatic colors, unflattering lighting, and ugly set decoration. Though never forcibly unsightly as a number of films I can think of (particularly Gary Oldman’s Nil by Mouth, though I have no idea what made me think of it), Coixet knows exactly what she means to convey with The Secret Life of Words. Though dialogue is key (and “words” is in the title), it doesn’t serve as the distraction one might think. Instead, The Secret Life of Words becomes a film of expressions, both between characters and within the frame itself. The film takes place in what we’re lead to believe is the loneliest place on earth, an oil rig in the middle of the ocean. Hanna (Sarah Polley), to cure the boredom of her month-long vacation from working in a factory, assumes the role of a nurse by chance, caring for Josef (Tim Robbins), who was temporarily blinded and badly burned during a fire on the rig. Hanna, deaf and closed-off, predictably sheds her armor with Josef late in the film, but the relationship between her and Josef isn’t the sole focus of the film. Coixet attempts, and often succeeds, at creating this landscape of desolation, from the two leads to the other, remaining members on the rig, including Simon (Javier Cámara) as the cook who hides his own sadness with the guise of culture and jovialness. Ultimately, The Secret Life of Words isn’t nearly as emotionally gratifying as Coixet intended, though in her second venture as director (her first was My Life Without Me, also with Polley, and also produced by the Almodóvar brothers), she continues to show promise, creating a detailed world and provoking the same sort of unexpected feelings that one of her producers has become known for. El Calentito - dir. Chus Gutiérrez - 2005 - Spain\nI suppose it’s sort of difficult to discuss contemporary Spanish cinema without a small mention of Pedro Almodóvar. El Calentito owes much to Almodóvar’s Labyrinth of Passion, a depiction of post-Franco youth run wild in Spain, so much so that it even includes a directly lifted scene from the film with the director himself on stage. Naturally, with such inspiration, the film contains some signatures of Almodóvar: strong females, hot lesbians, punk music (which was more prevalent in his earlier films), and (of course) transvestites.\n\nFROM 23 FEBRUARY TO 30 MARCH 2017\nVenue: Filmoteca de Catalunya\nTHURSDAY 23 FEBRUARY, AT 8 pm AND SATURDAY 25 FEBRUARY AT 7 pm\n23 F. La película (23 F. The Movie). Chema de la Peña, 2011\nCast: Paco Tous, Fernando Cayo, Juan Diego, Mariano Venancio. Spain. VO. 98 min. 23 F is the first feature film to reconstruct the coup d’état of 1981. From the storming of the Congress to the release of the deputies, it relives the seventeen-and-a-half hours that shook the foundations of a young democracy. Presented by Chema de la Peña, Thursday 23 February\nChema de la Peña is an economist and autodidact. In 1993 he created his own production company with which he made his first short films, commercials and video clips. Among his feature films are Shacky Carmine (1999); the comedy Isi & Disi, the biggest box-office draw of 2004, with two Goya Prize nominations; Sud Express (2006), filmed in France, Spain and Portugal; and Un cine como tú en un país como este (A Cinema Like You in a Country Like This, 2010), about the first generation of directors who were able to make uncensored films in 1976, a year after the death of Franco. TUESDAY 28 FEBRUARY, AT 6.30 pm\nManderley. Jesús Garay, 1979\nCast: José Ocaña, Enrique Rada, Joan Ferrer, Pío Muriedas, Antonio Martín. Spain. VO. 114 min. Garay was inspired by three of his friends – the protagonists of the film, including the painter Ocaña – to tell the story of three homosexuals who decide to spend the summer together in a country house in Santander, owned by the parents of one of them. Garay sympathetically depicts a number of attitudes that at the time were considered shocking and even unnatural. Consequently, the film was confined to adult cinemas, despite having nothing to do with conventional pornography. Presented by Jesús Garay\nJesús Garay (Santander, 1949) is a director, writer and film critic. In 1969 he founded the group La Fábrica de Cine in Santander. He has participated from the beginning in the production of alternative films of a collective nature and in non-professional formats. He has also made commercials and corporate films. Among his best-known works are Pasión lejana (1986), La banyera (1989) and Eloïse (2009). THURSDAY 2 MARCH, AT 6.30 pm AND SUNDAY 19 MARCH, AT 4.30 pm\nCon uñas y dientes (With Nails and Teeth). Paulino Viota, 1977\nCast: Alicia Sánchez, Santiago Ramos, Alfredo Mayo, Víctor Petit, Francisco Vidal, Guadalupe G. Güemes, Fidel Almansa. Spain. VO. 96 min. With a delayed and underground release, the film uses the development of a strike to offer a bitter view of the Transition, and portrays the frustrated hopes of a broad sector of Spanish society of the time. ‘Despite being written very quickly, this film is a kind of crystallisation of a very long work. My basic influences for Con uñas y dientes were Brecht and Marxism in general. The struggle against Franco led me, like many others, to Marxism and, in art, to Brecht. With the political reform that replaced the old regime, the scope of what could be said in Spanish cinema was extended. Con uñas y dientes was the first Spanish film – since the Civil War – to deal explicitly with the class struggle. It expanded the spectrum of characters that could appear on the screen, giving a voice to the working class, and it did so from a Marxist point of view, addressed especially to working class people.’ (Paulino Viota)\nPresented by Santiago López Petit, Thursday 2 March\nSantiago López Petit (Barcelona, 1950) is a philosopher. He was a militant of the workers’ autonomy during the seventies, when he worked as a chemist, and Professor of Philosophy at the Universitat de Barcelona (1990–2013). His most recent books are La movilización global (Madrid, 2009) and Hijos de la noche (Barcelona, 2014). He has promoted collective initiatives such as Dinero Gratis and Espai en Blanc. TUESDAY 7 MARCH, AT 6.30 pm AND THURSDAY 30 MARCH, AT 9.30 pm\nEl diputado (The Deputy).\n\nMagnolia has picked these up for US release, and I'm sure they'll just go straight to video, but check out Mirageman when you can. It's really worth it. THE BACKWOODS - Spanish-produced Straw Dogs riff that stars Gary Oldman and Paddy Considine as two Brits who go to the wilds of Spain for a vacation with their foreign-born wives. The locals start lusting after Considine's French hottie, they discover a secret in the woods, and the locals come after them. A serious 70s vibe permeates this movie, which is also a major Peckinpah homage. Unfortunately, the many Spanish sequences weren't subtitled in this print, but we still got the point. It's a good updating of the earlier film, removing much of its misogyny but retaining its viciousness. There's no siege, as in the original, but rather a different kind of final confrontation. The two UK actors are great and the movie is gorgeously shot. Not sure where this one is going in the US, but hopefully it'll see a release. YOUR MOMMY KILLS ANIMALS - caught this controversial documentary on DVD-R screener, and really liked it. It opens with some shocking footage of workers abusing dogs at some kind of animal testing facility, but backs off the shock tactics for the rest of the film. And despite its oddball title, it's a remarkably even-handed documentary about the animal rights movement that'll definitely change your opinion of at least some of its subjects. The only organizations that really get skewered are the Humane Society and PETA, and that's more for their oversized corporate problems these days than for anything else (although they go into great detail about PETA's seemingly contradictory policy on euthanizing homeless animals). I think this is getting a release here in theatres, and it's worth seeing. GARY'S TOUCH - the most controversial film of the fest, and it was only a 20-minute short that screened during Small Gauge Trauma. Made by a gay, Asian, Ottawa resident, the movie is about a creepy homeless guy intent on procreating, despite the fact that he's not attracted to women and has some serious personality issues. To say any more would be to spoil this film's myriad surprises. Suffice to say that it's probably best if you haven't had a full meal before viewing it. THE TRIPPER - David Arquette's directorial debut, a gore comedy about a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask who offs hippies. And that's about it. Not nearly as bad as it sounds, yet not all that good, either. AMPHIBIAN MAN - the 1961 Russian fantasy flick about an underwater dude who romances a land-girl. Heavily melodramatic and padded, but still charming in its own way. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR - like last year's The Lost, this one is based on a full-strength Jack Ketchum novel, though this is always the one that people say \"couldn't be filmed\". Well, apparently there are two versions of the story coming out, this one and another based on the true-crime tale that inspired the novel 20 years ago (An American Crime). About a group of kids in the mid-50s (early 60s in the other movie) led by their delinquent mother to torture and imprison an orphaned cousin who's staying with them, it's grueling throughout and seriously divided the audience. The original story is extremely powerful and well-observed in its ability to show how \"ordinary\" people can do inhuman things in the right circumstances (think Abu Ghraib, etc), but I think that the filmmakers who did this version weren't quite up to the task of translating the story. It lacks any kind of transcendence or meaningful resolution. Although they certainly gave it the college try, I think it remained beyond their grasp. I'd have liked to have seen what a more experienced group of filmmakers could have done with the material, and definitely look forward to American Crime, which I hear is a much better movie. AL FINAL DEL ESPECTRO - you didn't know that lame ripoffs of Asian horror came from places other than Hollywood, did you? Add Colombia to the list.\n\nHello ladies and gentlemen, Muldoon here with this week's selection of interesting short films from all over the globe. Each film this week was submitted by the films' creators, not a PR company, but real folks who rolled up their sleeves, set out to accomplish something, and did. Much like every other week, these are my personal picks, which may or may not align with what kind of films you're into. What I can say is I think they're each pretty cool in their own special ways, so one thing you're not going to get this week are multiple versions of the same story. So without further ado, let's hop right on into this week's lineup and just have some fun watching cool movies. Boom! To kick things off right, I've got a film I \"like\" from Daniel Reisinger. (I'll keep my day job...) Daniel's created a rather hilarious film that feels all too real. It's a modern day \"be careful what you wish for\" style flick that feels fresh and pokes at our collective obsession with Facebook. The short defiintely goes in directions you might not expect, but ultimately find yourself enjoying. Great acting. Great Humor. Great way to kick this week's lineup off! \"In a world where every loser is pretending their life is awesome on Facebook - Allan Kasvotski's status updates are suddenly coming true.\" I firmly believe Reisinger is a force to be reckoned with, a talent I want to see more from, so I definitely suggest you folks hit up his website if you feel the same! KAFKA'S LITTLE FABLE\n\"Adapted from a short story by Franz Kafka, Kafka’s Little Fable is about a powerless mouse bound by fear who longs to escape his fate, only to be consumed by it instead.\" I love this next short. It's got a unique look to it that's coupled with great narration and sound design. M.R. Horhager's minute and a half of a short wil llikely stick with you the rest of the day, as it touches upon the idea of fear and how you can't let it consume you. If you like what you see here, then check out his Vimeo page (and check out my favorite of his: I HATE YOU RED LIGHT!). Next up is more of a conceptual pitch featuring an array of demonic visions from Toby Meakins. Meakins last popped up here with BREATHE, which is now in the works to become a feature (Congrats, man!). \"Malevolent spirits plague the land feeding on pain,suffering and DEATH. There remains one hope amidst the terror.... Ghoster.\" Let's be honest here - I hope to share shorts here on SATURDAY SHORTS, but found this just... badass, and needed to share. I hope to see this thing come to fruition. I GOT YOUR NOSE\nJon Kovel is back with something rather twisted, the perfect short for SATURDAY SHORTS (and for Crypt TV as well)! \"It's a twisted short about the deadly consequences the kiddie game of \"got your nose\" has on our young ones.\" Short. Sweet. To the point. Check out more of Jon's work over on Funny Or Die - the guy's consistently delivering solid content. Joe Lescolla has our last short of the day, a densely atmospheric short that fondly looks back at the monster flicks of the 80's. BAM! That's it for this week, ladies and gents. Hopefully I'll see you all a week from now with another handful of great films from all over. I have no clue what all it will entail, but they will be shorts I can get behind, I know that much! Have a great week! (Go out and make something cool.) If you have a short and think it belongs here or are on the fence about whether to send it in, please do send it in - I'd love to see what you've put together. I've already seen hundreds of fresh new filmmakers' shorts and like any good addict, I need more!\n\nIn my quest to watch as many of this year’s Oscar nominated films as I can, I checked out a screening of all five of the Live Action Short nominees. The results were… depressing! That said, I did like 4 of the 5 films, to varying degrees. Below are my brief thoughts on each, in the order I watched them. Mother (Rodrigo Sorogoyen, Spain)\nPerhaps the ideal use of the short film format, Mother tells an economical story in a trim 18 minutes. It’s self-contained and propulsive, ratcheting up the tension by using a single shot for the majority of its runtime. The acting is solid, selling this story of a mother who receives a call from her young son who’s been left by himself in an unknown location. Of course, things only escalate from there, but we always stay on the mother’s end of the line so the viewer is similarly left in the dark of what exactly is happening. I would have liked a bit more character development to make it easier to get emotionally invested. But the slick filmmaking provides plenty of narrative stakes on its own. Fauve (Jeremy Comte, Canada)\nComte’s short is easily my favourite of the bunch, telling the story of two boys who are out exploring on their own and get into far more trouble than they expect. The child actors are excellent and Comte’s camera is patient, giving the film an extremely naturalistic feel. The story unfolds at the perfect pace, building to a subtle but emotionally impactful ending. There is an artistry to Fauve that sets it apart from the others, and I’d be extremely interested to see what Comte could do with the feature-length format. He has a knack for visual storytelling. Because while like most of the other shorts in this programme Fauve is grim, it never wallows and instead earns its somberness. I would be surprised if this one won the Oscar, but it would certainly be worthy. Marguerite (Marianne Farley, Canada)\nThe category’s second offering from Canada, Marguerite is actually the most uplifting of the bunch. Which is an interesting thing to say about a film that follows a dying elderly women thinking about the great regrets of her life. But there is a hopefulness and warmth to Marguerite that actually makes it quite lovely. There are only two actors in the film (Beatrice Picard and Sandrine Bisson) and both are wonderful, lending a lot of emotional heft to the proceedings. The film’s character intimacy is its great strength. Less strong is the pacing, which feels a bit shaggy even at only 19 minutes long. While emotionally affecting and overall a strong showing, it felt like there was just one small element missing. Detainment (Vincent Lambe, Ireland)\nI can almost always find a way to at least justify a film’s existence, but that’s not really the case with Detainment. Tackling the distressing true story of two 10-year-old boys accused of murdering a toddler, it comes across as not only exploitative (which would be bad enough) but also artless. There’s no real visual style, atmosphere, or narrative tension (beyond the general sense of dread stemming from the subject matter) to be found. The bright spot (if you can call it that) of the film is the performance by Ely Solan as one of the two boys, the doe-eyed Jon. It is an unsettlingly excellent performance from such a young actor, to the point where it made me wonder about the ethics of putting child actors into such a disturbing (yes, fictional) situation. There simply isn’t a reason for this movie to exist. It’s one thing to be bleak. It’s another to use real-life tragedy for shock value and do nothing more with it. Skin (Guy Nattiv, USA)\nI have mixed feelings on Skin. Partly, I think it suffered for being the last of the five shorts shown in the programme, forced to follow up all the grimness that came before. But more than that, I think it just goes overboard to make its point. The subject matter (concerning a racially-based hate crime in the small-town southern USA) is no doubt important. But while I think (?)\n\nQuestion:I'm interested in the short films produced in Spain in 1997 - could you recommend some notable works from that period?",

            "passage": "\"Codex Atanicus\" is a collection of the three most twisted short films by Spanish director Carlos Atanes. The three shorts, \"Metaminds & Metabodies\", \"Morfing\" and \"Welcome to Spain\" will take you into a movie universe few people have found before. I didn't know what I was getting into when I contacted Carlos Atanes about getting a screener for his DVD collection \"Codex Atanicus\". I've seen plenty of surreal\/art house films and I wasn't really expecting to be surprised. Shocked even. Not at graphic violence or violation, but at how different Carlos Atanes' movies are to anything I've ever seen. He has a certain way to confuse the flying fuck out of me, while still keeping me interested in whatever messed up situation is playing on the screen in front of me. I don't understand what he is trying to say, and I don't understand how he comes up with it, but I'm impressed. The first short on the DVD, \"Metaminds & Metabodies\" is really hard to dissect and go through in detail. It's all taking place in a bar that is suppose to represent the waiting room for Hell... somehow, and it starts out with something that seems like a live performance where a girl is singing some strange song while being hooked into the wall through barbed wire. Meanwhile, a man is threatening her that he will eat a contract. Like I said, it first seemed like a live performance in the bar, but that kinda changed when the man gets shot after eating the contract and whatnot. Don't ask me what kind of contract it is, 'cause I don't know. Following scenes seemed pretty much random but I'm sure that Carlos Atanes had a point in all of this, and I would love to find out some day, but right now it all just seemed like random ideas put together. But, it offered some twisted moments, some gore and some naked chicks, so even if you don't understand what's going on, there's still some odd pleasures to find in this movie. Moving over to the next short, \"Morfing\", and not really sure where to start on this one. The... ehum.. story, I suppose.. is alot easier to follow than in \"Metaminds & Metabodies\", but this is still nothing less than a huge \"what the fuck?\"-moment. It's basicly about a girl who has a camera man following her while she follows the director of these films, Carlos Atanes (yes, THESE films) while he is trying to get his new film \"Morfing\" into production. However, before she gets to discuss the movie with him, she finds him in the bathroom trying to hang himself. After convincing him he might as well give it another go, they set out to find people who wants to finance his film, and people to star in it. All of this sounds fairly normal, but I assure you that dialogue and random things they meet (girl with an alien-ish arm, man who dies after getting a bloody baby thrown at him, and so on) make it all too weird to explain. The short ends with the actual film that they are trying to get into production, and well.. It's basicly a minute or two long, with some more of the typical Carlos Atanes mono\/dialogues and a shot of a girl getting drenched in what I think is suppose to be sperm. I really urge you to watch this movie as it's entertaining in both a strange way, and a highly comical way. \"Welcome To Spain\" is my least favorite of these three art house films, but that's not me saying it's a bad film. It's definitely another strange ride, and when the words written on the front cover, \"Three wild tales\" were written down, they weren't kidding. Here we have another innovative short from this Spanish director that gives you absolutely no clues as to what he is trying to say, but you're intrigued and you want to find out what the reason for these things are. I can't say much about \"Welcome To Spain\", than that. Going into details with a film that basicly ends in a huge fight in a stairway where one guy masturbates to a photo, one swallows a nail and gets it pierced through his chin, and a girl biting a man's ass, is just not possible. I'm gonna end this review with a well-deserved; WHAT THE FUCK?",

I wasn't able to attend all of the screenings, but I did get to see one feature film and two great shorts programs over the course of the weekend. Here are my thoughts on what I saw. The one feature film that I was able to catch was the opening night, midnight presentation of \"The Human Race\". To read my review CLICK HERE! The two blocks of shorts I was able to attend featured films from the science fiction and horror genres. There was a very diverse mix of styles, ideas, and concepts throughout each block and I was impressed with the overall quality on display. Below, you will see a brief synopsis for each of the shorts that, in my opinion, were the most memorable including my overall favorite which I saved for the very end. \"Appntmnt\" gives you a whole different way to look at those random people you see on the street in every day life. Does that homeless person over in the corner actually have a story to tell? If you know me at all, you understand how I believe that \"The Cabin in the Woods\" is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. Erik Gardner's \"Blue Hole\" gives yet another twist on the classic tale of people finding more than they bargained for out in the wilderness. This nine minute entry from Spain also screened this year at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Short Film Festival which was held at the world famous Cinerama theater. Director, Javier Chillón's short film is a highly entertaining and well deserved entry in to both festivals. Are you scared of clowns or do you love the way they make you laugh? Either way, \"Dorothy\" just might give you a whole new perspective in this blood soaked Australian short film from director Eros Romero. Margot Kidder stars in one of the more elaborate short films from this year's crop of selections. \"HENRi\" shows how an artificial intelligence can evolve and adapt over time under the most dire of circumstances. Thanks to Guillermo Del Toro, Spain has become a breeding ground for some very creative and truly scary horror stories. Out of everything I saw during MIFFF, Leyenda (Legend) was one of my favorites as it took a no holds barred approach that reminded me a lot of Del Toro's \"Pan's Labyrinth\", but still managed to hold its own and not fall into the dreaded copycat territory. Director Ryan Denmark has a very interesting sense of humor as \"Plush\" was easily one the funnier entries I had the pleasure of seeing. You may think twice about leaving that teddy bear on your bed after you see this movie which redefines what it means to be cute and cuddly. \"Velvet Road\" is a zombie period piece which shows what it might be like if a zombie outbreak happened during the 1960's. This actually turned out to be one of the more emotionally charged films as race, love, and the undead all come crashing together on a southern back road. BEST SHORT FILM\nBEST SHORT FILM\nWritten by and starring Marion Kerr, \"FAR\" was the one short film that stood out above all the rest. Director Brian Crewe has earned the distinction of creating the TwoOhSix.com \"Official Selection\" for Best Short Film at the Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape.

            "passage": "Old Joy - dir. Kelly Reichardt - 2006 - USA\nA heterosexual Brokeback Mountain? Sideways for realists? These are just a few comparisons I’ve heard made toward Old Joy, Kelly Reichardt’s second feature-length film after appearing briefly in Hal Hartley’s The Unbelievable Truth and working as a costume designer on Todd Haynes’ Poison. Neither comparison does her film justice, as the film is never particularly “heterosexual” and is far more wonderful than any comparison to the painfully overrated Sideways. Two men escape their differing personal lives to rekindle their friendship on a two-day camping trip. Mark (Daniel London) is about to become a father; he hasn’t seen his friend Kurt (Will Oldham) in what seems to be a long time. Their life paths appear to have taken separate directions, but, organized by Kurt, they embark on their nature excursion. Old Joy is hardly the “get lost to find yourself” film you’re afraid it might become (Sideways), but instead a powerfully acute depiction of personal relations. In an all-to-brief seventy-six minutes, Reichardt leaves you wanting more, and that’s her particular strength, other than creating a fully-alive atmosphere. Old Joy is snippets of conversation, shadows of backstory, and richly textured emotions that seem too much to fill up the running time. But, like most great films, Old Joy resonates with mystery and, especially, intrigue and stands as one of the finest cinematic experiences I’ve endured. The Secret Life of Words (La vida secreta de las palabras) - dir. Isabel Coixet - 2005 - Spain\nYou have to hand it to a director that, unlike so many of their peers, strays away from the falseness of beautiful imagery and composition. In her second film, Coixet paints her film in monochromatic colors, unflattering lighting, and ugly set decoration. Though never forcibly unsightly as a number of films I can think of (particularly Gary Oldman’s Nil by Mouth, though I have no idea what made me think of it), Coixet knows exactly what she means to convey with The Secret Life of Words. Though dialogue is key (and “words” is in the title), it doesn’t serve as the distraction one might think. Instead, The Secret Life of Words becomes a film of expressions, both between characters and within the frame itself. The film takes place in what we’re lead to believe is the loneliest place on earth, an oil rig in the middle of the ocean. Hanna (Sarah Polley), to cure the boredom of her month-long vacation from working in a factory, assumes the role of a nurse by chance, caring for Josef (Tim Robbins), who was temporarily blinded and badly burned during a fire on the rig. Hanna, deaf and closed-off, predictably sheds her armor with Josef late in the film, but the relationship between her and Josef isn’t the sole focus of the film. Coixet attempts, and often succeeds, at creating this landscape of desolation, from the two leads to the other, remaining members on the rig, including Simon (Javier Cámara) as the cook who hides his own sadness with the guise of culture and jovialness. Ultimately, The Secret Life of Words isn’t nearly as emotionally gratifying as Coixet intended, though in her second venture as director (her first was My Life Without Me, also with Polley, and also produced by the Almodóvar brothers), she continues to show promise, creating a detailed world and provoking the same sort of unexpected feelings that one of her producers has become known for. El Calentito - dir. Chus Gutiérrez - 2005 - Spain\nI suppose it’s sort of difficult to discuss contemporary Spanish cinema without a small mention of Pedro Almodóvar. El Calentito owes much to Almodóvar’s Labyrinth of Passion, a depiction of post-Franco youth run wild in Spain, so much so that it even includes a directly lifted scene from the film with the director himself on stage. Naturally, with such inspiration, the film contains some signatures of Almodóvar: strong females, hot lesbians, punk music (which was more prevalent in his earlier films), and (of course) transvestites.",

Chema de la Peña, 2011\nCast: Paco Tous, Fernando Cayo, Juan Diego, Mariano Venancio. Spain. VO. 98 min. 23 F is the first feature film to reconstruct the coup d’état of 1981. From the storming of the Congress to the release of the deputies, it relives the seventeen-and-a-half hours that shook the foundations of a young democracy. Presented by Chema de la Peña, Thursday 23 February\nChema de la Peña is an economist and autodidact. In 1993 he created his own production company with which he made his first short films, commercials and video clips. Among his feature films are Shacky Carmine (1999); the comedy Isi & Disi, the biggest box-office draw of 2004, with two Goya Prize nominations; Sud Express (2006), filmed in France, Spain and Portugal; and Un cine como tú en un país como este (A Cinema Like You in a Country Like This, 2010), about the first generation of directors who were able to make uncensored films in 1976, a year after the death of Franco. TUESDAY 28 FEBRUARY, AT 6.30 pm\nManderley. Jesús Garay, 1979\nCast: José Ocaña, Enrique Rada, Joan Ferrer, Pío Muriedas, Antonio Martín. Spain. VO. 114 min. Garay was inspired by three of his friends – the protagonists of the film, including the painter Ocaña – to tell the story of three homosexuals who decide to spend the summer together in a country house in Santander, owned by the parents of one of them. Garay sympathetically depicts a number of attitudes that at the time were considered shocking and even unnatural. Consequently, the film was confined to adult cinemas, despite having nothing to do with conventional pornography. Presented by Jesús Garay\nJesús Garay (Santander, 1949) is a director, writer and film critic. In 1969 he founded the group La Fábrica de Cine in Santander. He has participated from the beginning in the production of alternative films of a collective nature and in non-professional formats. He has also made commercials and corporate films. Among his best-known works are Pasión lejana (1986), La banyera (1989) and Eloïse (2009). THURSDAY 2 MARCH, AT 6.30 pm AND SUNDAY 19 MARCH, AT 4.30 pm\nCon uñas y dientes (With Nails and Teeth). Paulino Viota, 1977\nCast: Alicia Sánchez, Santiago Ramos, Alfredo Mayo, Víctor Petit, Francisco Vidal, Guadalupe G. Güemes, Fidel Almansa. Spain. VO. 96 min. With a delayed and underground release, the film uses the development of a strike to offer a bitter view of the Transition, and portrays the frustrated hopes of a broad sector of Spanish society of the time. ‘Despite being written very quickly, this film is a kind of crystallisation of a very long work. My basic influences for Con uñas y dientes were Brecht and Marxism in general. The struggle against Franco led me, like many others, to Marxism and, in art, to Brecht. With the political reform that replaced the old regime, the scope of what could be said in Spanish cinema was extended. Con uñas y dientes was the first Spanish film – since the Civil War – to deal explicitly with the class struggle. It expanded the spectrum of characters that could appear on the screen, giving a voice to the working class, and it did so from a Marxist point of view, addressed especially to working class people.’ (Paulino Viota)\nPresented by Santiago López Petit, Thursday 2 March\nSantiago López Petit (Barcelona, 1950) is a philosopher. He was a militant of the workers’ autonomy during the seventies, when he worked as a chemist, and Professor of Philosophy at the Universitat de Barcelona (1990–2013). His most recent books are La movilización global (Madrid, 2009) and Hijos de la noche (Barcelona, 2014). He has promoted collective initiatives such as Dinero Gratis and Espai en Blanc.

            "passage": "Magnolia has picked these up for US release, and I'm sure they'll just go straight to video, but check out Mirageman when you can. It's really worth it. THE BACKWOODS - Spanish-produced Straw Dogs riff that stars Gary Oldman and Paddy Considine as two Brits who go to the wilds of Spain for a vacation with their foreign-born wives. The locals start lusting after Considine's French hottie, they discover a secret in the woods, and the locals come after them. A serious 70s vibe permeates this movie, which is also a major Peckinpah homage. Unfortunately, the many Spanish sequences weren't subtitled in this print, but we still got the point. It's a good updating of the earlier film, removing much of its misogyny but retaining its viciousness. There's no siege, as in the original, but rather a different kind of final confrontation. The two UK actors are great and the movie is gorgeously shot. Not sure where this one is going in the US, but hopefully it'll see a release. YOUR MOMMY KILLS ANIMALS - caught this controversial documentary on DVD-R screener, and really liked it. It opens with some shocking footage of workers abusing dogs at some kind of animal testing facility, but backs off the shock tactics for the rest of the film. And despite its oddball title, it's a remarkably even-handed documentary about the animal rights movement that'll definitely change your opinion of at least some of its subjects. The only organizations that really get skewered are the Humane Society and PETA, and that's more for their oversized corporate problems these days than for anything else (although they go into great detail about PETA's seemingly contradictory policy on euthanizing homeless animals). I think this is getting a release here in theatres, and it's worth seeing. GARY'S TOUCH - the most controversial film of the fest, and it was only a 20-minute short that screened during Small Gauge Trauma. Made by a gay, Asian, Ottawa resident, the movie is about a creepy homeless guy intent on procreating, despite the fact that he's not attracted to women and has some serious personality issues. To say any more would be to spoil this film's myriad surprises. Suffice to say that it's probably best if you haven't had a full meal before viewing it. THE TRIPPER - David Arquette's directorial debut, a gore comedy about a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask who offs hippies. And that's about it. Not nearly as bad as it sounds, yet not all that good, either. AMPHIBIAN MAN - the 1961 Russian fantasy flick about an underwater dude who romances a land-girl. Heavily melodramatic and padded, but still charming in its own way. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR - like last year's The Lost, this one is based on a full-strength Jack Ketchum novel, though this is always the one that people say \"couldn't be filmed\". Well, apparently there are two versions of the story coming out, this one and another based on the true-crime tale that inspired the novel 20 years ago (An American Crime). About a group of kids in the mid-50s (early 60s in the other movie) led by their delinquent mother to torture and imprison an orphaned cousin who's staying with them, it's grueling throughout and seriously divided the audience. The original story is extremely powerful and well-observed in its ability to show how \"ordinary\" people can do inhuman things in the right circumstances (think Abu Ghraib, etc), but I think that the filmmakers who did this version weren't quite up to the task of translating the story. It lacks any kind of transcendence or meaningful resolution. Although they certainly gave it the college try, I think it remained beyond their grasp. I'd have liked to have seen what a more experienced group of filmmakers could have done with the material, and definitely look forward to American Crime, which I hear is a much better movie. AL FINAL DEL ESPECTRO - you didn't know that lame ripoffs of Asian horror came from places other than Hollywood, did you? Add Colombia to the list.",

            "passage": "Hello ladies and gentlemen, Muldoon here with this week's selection of interesting short films from all over the globe. Each film this week was submitted by the films' creators, not a PR company, but real folks who rolled up their sleeves, set out to accomplish something, and did. Much like every other week, these are my personal picks, which may or may not align with what kind of films you're into. What I can say is I think they're each pretty cool in their own special ways, so one thing you're not going to get this week are multiple versions of the same story. So without further ado, let's hop right on into this week's lineup and just have some fun watching cool movies. Boom! To kick things off right, I've got a film I \"like\" from Daniel Reisinger. (I'll keep my day job...) Daniel's created a rather hilarious film that feels all too real. It's a modern day \"be careful what you wish for\" style flick that feels fresh and pokes at our collective obsession with Facebook. The short defiintely goes in directions you might not expect, but ultimately find yourself enjoying. Great acting. Great Humor. Great way to kick this week's lineup off! \"In a world where every loser is pretending their life is awesome on Facebook - Allan Kasvotski's status updates are suddenly coming true.\" I firmly believe Reisinger is a force to be reckoned with, a talent I want to see more from, so I definitely suggest you folks hit up his website if you feel the same! KAFKA'S LITTLE FABLE\n\"Adapted from a short story by Franz Kafka, Kafka’s Little Fable is about a powerless mouse bound by fear who longs to escape his fate, only to be consumed by it instead.\" I love this next short. It's got a unique look to it that's coupled with great narration and sound design. M.R. Horhager's minute and a half of a short wil llikely stick with you the rest of the day, as it touches upon the idea of fear and how you can't let it consume you. If you like what you see here, then check out his Vimeo page (and check out my favorite of his: I HATE YOU RED LIGHT!). Next up is more of a conceptual pitch featuring an array of demonic visions from Toby Meakins. Meakins last popped up here with BREATHE, which is now in the works to become a feature (Congrats, man!). \"Malevolent spirits plague the land feeding on pain,suffering and DEATH. There remains one hope amidst the terror.... Ghoster.\" Let's be honest here - I hope to share shorts here on SATURDAY SHORTS, but found this just... badass, and needed to share. I hope to see this thing come to fruition. I GOT YOUR NOSE\nJon Kovel is back with something rather twisted, the perfect short for SATURDAY SHORTS (and for Crypt TV as well)! \"It's a twisted short about the deadly consequences the kiddie game of \"got your nose\" has on our young ones.\" Short. Sweet. To the point. Check out more of Jon's work over on Funny Or Die - the guy's consistently delivering solid content. Joe Lescolla has our last short of the day, a densely atmospheric short that fondly looks back at the monster flicks of the 80's. BAM! That's it for this week, ladies and gents. Hopefully I'll see you all a week from now with another handful of great films from all over. I have no clue what all it will entail, but they will be shorts I can get behind, I know that much! Have a great week! (Go out and make something cool.) If you have a short and think it belongs here or are on the fence about whether to send it in, please do send it in - I'd love to see what you've put together. I've already seen hundreds of fresh new filmmakers' shorts and like any good addict, I need more!",

            "passage": "In my quest to watch as many of this year’s Oscar nominated films as I can, I checked out a screening of all five of the Live Action Short nominees. The results were… depressing! That said, I did like 4 of the 5 films, to varying degrees. Below are my brief thoughts on each, in the order I watched them. Mother (Rodrigo Sorogoyen, Spain)\nPerhaps the ideal use of the short film format, Mother tells an economical story in a trim 18 minutes. It’s self-contained and propulsive, ratcheting up the tension by using a single shot for the majority of its runtime. The acting is solid, selling this story of a mother who receives a call from her young son who’s been left by himself in an unknown location. Of course, things only escalate from there, but we always stay on the mother’s end of the line so the viewer is similarly left in the dark of what exactly is happening. I would have liked a bit more character development to make it easier to get emotionally invested. But the slick filmmaking provides plenty of narrative stakes on its own. Fauve (Jeremy Comte, Canada)\nComte’s short is easily my favourite of the bunch, telling the story of two boys who are out exploring on their own and get into far more trouble than they expect. The child actors are excellent and Comte’s camera is patient, giving the film an extremely naturalistic feel. The story unfolds at the perfect pace, building to a subtle but emotionally impactful ending. There is an artistry to Fauve that sets it apart from the others, and I’d be extremely interested to see what Comte could do with the feature-length format. He has a knack for visual storytelling. Because while like most of the other shorts in this programme Fauve is grim, it never wallows and instead earns its somberness. I would be surprised if this one won the Oscar, but it would certainly be worthy. Marguerite (Marianne Farley, Canada)\nThe category’s second offering from Canada, Marguerite is actually the most uplifting of the bunch. Which is an interesting thing to say about a film that follows a dying elderly women thinking about the great regrets of her life. But there is a hopefulness and warmth to Marguerite that actually makes it quite lovely. There are only two actors in the film (Beatrice Picard and Sandrine Bisson) and both are wonderful, lending a lot of emotional heft to the proceedings. The film’s character intimacy is its great strength. Less strong is the pacing, which feels a bit shaggy even at only 19 minutes long. While emotionally affecting and overall a strong showing, it felt like there was just one small element missing. Detainment (Vincent Lambe, Ireland)\nI can almost always find a way to at least justify a film’s existence, but that’s not really the case with Detainment. Tackling the distressing true story of two 10-year-old boys accused of murdering a toddler, it comes across as not only exploitative (which would be bad enough) but also artless. There’s no real visual style, atmosphere, or narrative tension (beyond the general sense of dread stemming from the subject matter) to be found. The bright spot (if you can call it that) of the film is the performance by Ely Solan as one of the two boys, the doe-eyed Jon. It is an unsettlingly excellent performance from such a young actor, to the point where it made me wonder about the ethics of putting child actors into such a disturbing (yes, fictional) situation. There simply isn’t a reason for this movie to exist. It’s one thing to be bleak. It’s another to use real-life tragedy for shock value and do nothing more with it. Skin (Guy Nattiv, USA)\nI have mixed feelings on Skin. Partly, I think it suffered for being the last of the five shorts shown in the programme, forced to follow up all the grimness that came before. But more than that, I think it just goes overboard to make its point. The subject matter (concerning a racially-based hate crime in the small-town southern USA) is no doubt important. But while I think (?)",

    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Step 1: What is Arduino? Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.\n\nChoosing an Arduino for Your Project\nThe next step in the Arduino evolutionary chain was merging the USB-to-Serial programming part of the board onto the main MCU. That meant we had to leave the ATmega328 behind -- because it doesn't natively support USB -- in favor of the ATmega32U4. Aside from the additional USB support, the 32U4 is largely similar to the 328. Both are 8-bit AVRs with 32kB of flash memory, 22-ish I\/O lines, ADCs, UARTs, timers, etc. These ATmega32U4 boards often have the benefit of being cheaper than the ATmega328-based boards -- there's one less costly IC to put on there. They can also do things regular Arduino boards can't, like emulate a USB keyboard\/mouse. On the downside, they can be less reliable, and more difficult to use. The Leonardo is the patriarch of all ATmega32U4 Arduino boards. It shares the same form factor and I\/O placement (analog, PWM, I2C pins in the same place) as the Arduino Uno, so it remains shield compatible. Arduino Leonardo with HeadersDEV-11286\nDifferences between the Leonardo and the Uno? Aside from the new microcontroller, and lack of a second USB-to-Serial-converting IC, there's not many. The USB connector is different, the Leonardo connects to a computer via a micro-B USB cable. The driver installation process is also a bit more involved -- sometimes it can take a little extra fidgeting to get the board installed on your computer. Just as the Pro Mini took the guts of the Arduino Uno and shrunk them down, the Pro Micro works as a miniature version of the Leonardo. Unlike the Pro Mini, the Pro Micro doesn't require an external board to upload a sketch -- the 32U4 takes care of everything! Pro Micros are among the more complicated Arduino boards to get up and running. There are extra steps required to enable them in your Arduino environment, and a misstep can (at least temporarily) \"brick\" the Pro Micro. These boards are a good choice if you're an advanced Arduino-er and have a small USB-oriented project in mind (a mini USB keyboard\/mouse?). There are plenty of other riffs on the Leonardo design as well. There's the Fio v3, for any Arduino Leonardo project you might want to add an XBee to. Or the Qduino Mini which adds a LiPo charger and battery fuel gauge, and two RGB LEDs (one for status and another that is user programmable!). The board was designed by Quin at the age of 14 and manufactured at SparkFun. Bare Conductive Touch Board\nThen there is the Bare Conductive touch board. Basically it is a Arduino Leonardo designed to turn almost any material or surface into a sensor. The board comes with a built-in capacitive touch sensor, a MP3 decoder IC, microSD card socket, and LiPo charge IC to create light switches, musical instruments, custom interactive surfaces.\n\nFor debugging your programs, you need to do workarounds to see the Serial.prints() in your setup() routine. Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.\n\nThe long awaited ARM board by Arduino is finally here, now you can access higher level functionality while still using the wildly popular Arduino IDE. Warning: Unlike other Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I\/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I\/O pin could damage the board. If you are looking to interface 5V based product to the due we recommend using the Adafruit 8 channel bi-directional level converter. The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet). It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, CAN bus, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. If you're curious to what the erase button does well it.....hmmm....how can we put this?....it swiftly eliminates the sketch you've uploaded to it....and in other terms: it erases your sketch. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout. Some interesting applications for the Due:\nFeatures and Specs:\n|Input Voltage (recommended)||7-12V|\n|Input Voltage (limits)||6-20V|\n|Digital I\/O Pins||54 (of which 12 provide PWM output)|\n|Analog Input Pins||12|\n|Analog Outputs Pins||2 (DAC)|\n|Total DC Output Current on all I\/O lines||130 mA|\n|DC Current for 3.3V Pin||800 mA|\n|DC Current for 5V Pin||800 mA|\n|Flash Memory||512 KB all available for user applications|\n|SRAM||96 KB (two banks: 64KB and 32KB)|\n|Clock Speed||84 MHz|\nThe Due follows the 1.0 pinout:\nThe Due has a dedicated forum for discussing the board. Here is the specification page for more info. Note: You will have download the newer Arduino 1.5 and above in order to have the Due board available in the IDE. If you do any work with the ATtiny cores you will have to temporarily remove the \"hardware\" folder from your main Arduino Sketch folder or the Arduino 1.5.1 IDE will crash on boot. Since we work with the SB-FireFly all the time, this happened to us.\n\nArduino Due is here! Arduino announces the release of the new Arduino Due board based on the Cortex M3 ARM processor\nThe release of the 1.0 Arduino platform in 2011 represented a milestone for Open Source Hardware: after six years of development, Arduino is declared mature and stable. Once this was achieved, the team applied itself to the new version of Arduino designed to provide more creative options to users. The result of this work is the Arduino Due, a board that provides increased performance and faster connectivity at an affordable price (49 USD MSRP). Arduino Due is ideal for those who want to build projects that require high computing power such as the remotely-controlled drones that, in order to fly, need to process a lot of sensor data per second. Arduino Due gives students the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the ARM processor in a cheaper and much simpler way than before. To Scientific projects, which need to acquire data quickly and accurately, Arduino Due provides a platform to create open source tools that are much more advanced than those available now. The new platform enables the open source digital fabrication community (3d Printers, Laser cutters, CNC milling machines) to achieve higher resolutions and faster speed with fewer components than in the past. Main features of Arduino Due\n• The board is equipped with a SAM3X8E processor from Atmel, based on the 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz. • USB 2.0 interface running at 480 Megabits that allows Arduino Due to act as a USB Host (so you can interface it to USB devices like mice, keyboards, cameras, mobile phones and more). Arduino Due supports the Android ADK 2012 protocol. • 12 analog inputs (ADC) with 12-bit resolution and high speed, opening the door to audio applications and signal processing projects that were impossible with Arduino Uno. • High-resolution Analog outputs (DAC). The board provides two 12-bit outputs that can be used to generate audio signals. The Arduino Due software comes with software examples for a WAV and OGG player. • 4 high-speed serial communication ports. • 70 input\/output pins. • High-speed CAN interface. The CAN protocol is used in the automotive industry to network the different components of the car, is now becoming popular in the field of industrial automation thanks to its speed and ability to withstand electrical noise. • 12 PWM channels. • 2 I2C bus. Operating Voltage 3.3V\nInput Voltage (recommended) 7-12V\nInput Voltage (min\/max) 6-20V\nDigital I\/O Pins 54 (of which 6 provide PWM)\nAnalog Input Pins 12\nAnalog Output Pins 2 (DAC)\nTotal DC Output Current on all I\/O lines 130 mA\nDC Current for 3.3V Pin 800 mA\nDC Current for 5V Pin theoretical 1A, recommended 800 mA\nFlash Memory 512 KB\nSRAM 96 KB (64 + 32 KB)\nClock speed 84 MHz\nDebug access JTAG\/SWD connector\n\nTinkerers, DIY-nuts and electronic manglers, hold onto your hats: there’s a new Arduino in town. Everybody’s favorite prototyping board has just gained a new family member, in the shape of the Arduino Nano 3.0. It drops the size down to just 1.7 x 0.7 inches while still packing integrated mini-USB, top-mounted LEDs and ATMEGA328, and in fact the only thing you’re really doing without is the power jack. That’s because the Arduino Nano 3.0 is intended for breadboarding, where the compact dimensions will leave more space for other components. There are 14 digital I\/O pins – six of which provide PWM output – and eight analog input pins, together with 32KB of flash memory (though 2KB of that is reserved for the bootloader). If you’re wondering what all the fuss is about, the Arduino is an open hardware design that’s easily programmed in a C++ derivative. It’s commonly used to drive prototype hardware projects or interface between physical sensors and a computer; more information here or you can find previous Arduino projects we’ve covered here.\n\n\"Arduino\" is an open-source set of hardware and software designed around the ATMEGA series of microcontrollers. These are entire computers contained within a single chip.. with one of these chips, and a small number of external components, you have the framework for complex electronic projects and intelligent devices. It's intended to be used by people not normally interested in getting their hands dirty in the inner workings- artists (kinetic sculptures), robot builders, students, and prototyping hobbyists. In short, it simplifies the process of creating a special-purpose \"smart\" device. When referencing Arduino, many people refer to the entire package- the chip, the on-chip boot software, and the programming environment- as a single unit. In reality, nearly all aspects can be changed- the chips and hardware come in several flavors, as do boot software and the programming environment. To deviate from the \"package\" is fine, but with certain tradeoffs. Different flavor of hardware offer varying feature sets like memory size and operating speeds, while different development software platforms provide varying levels of programming ease traded off against efficiency. Development languages run the gamut- from simplified Firmata Scripting to Assembly Language coding (not for the faint of heart). There are even compiled and interpreted forms of BASIC which can be used. Because it provides a nice balance of simplicity and power, at least at the outset I will be using the Arduino development language, which is similar to \"C\" and based on a scripting language called Wiring. If you have ever done Java, Pascal, C++, or similar coding, then Arduino code should be easy to adapt to. Since this is mainly a command and control device, and we don't want to get too bogged down in syntax, the Arduino language and IDE will serve nicely while still keeping the code simple.. I'm a firm believer that keeping things simple makes for a better outcome. One nice aspect of the wide support base is that you can choose what you use- you don't need to change hardware if you change programming language and vice versa. To start off, I chose a variant of the Arduino called a Boarduino. I chose this variant because it offered several benefits for me over the \"Off the Rack\" standard Arduino. First, the Boarduino came as a self-assemble kit, not a finished product. It's been some time since I had done much electronic assembly, and considered that a well-designed kit would give me some much-needed practice soldering and handling components, while still being a project needing only an hour or so of relatively simple work. Secondly, the Boarduino design minimizes the component count, minimizing the complexity. Lastly, the Boarduino is extremely inexpensive, with the module components totalling around $15 per module, making it reasonable to dedicate a module to a \"permanent\" project. The absolute minimum hardware implementation of the chip circuit can be had for under $10 on eBay and other online vendors as of July 2010. Though underpowered for some of the projects I intend, there are Atmel processors which scale down to an eight-pin chip selling for under $2 each which still maintains a substantial amount of the function contained in the Atmega328\/Arduino platform. Conversely, Atmel and others produce similar but far more powerful devices at substantially higher cost also. For my purposes, the chosen platform offers a nice blend of power while still fitting into a Hobby budget. Boarduino kit, Assembled. The birth of a new machine. Boarduino kit, purchased locally but designed and sold by Adafruit. The local seller is actually a college student who is an avid fan of the Arduino\/Atmega platform. In addition to the components and board for the Boarduino itself, included was a kit-form interface card to allow a home computer to communicate with it via a PC serial port, a solderless prototyping breadboard, and a small assortment of components (LED's, resistors, etc) to start out with. Assembled Boarduino parked happily on the breadboard. Online assembly instructions for the module were fairly good, and would be able to be read and followed by a high school student with relative ease. Even before I first powered it, I've decided this module would make an EXCELLENT project for any tech-minded teen. Not only is the kit manageable, the module, when done, opens worlds of experiments for an inquisitive and creative mind.\n\nArduino Micro – Without HeadersARD-MICRON\nIt's the cutest, tiniest little Arduino yet! The Arduino Micro packs all of the power of the Arduino Leonardo in a 1.9\" x 0.7\" (48mm x 18mm) size. Although it may look like a stick of gum, its actually a USB-native 8-bit microcontroller, with 32K of flash, and 2.5K of RAM. You can program it directly via the USB micro connector on one end (or for the advanced users, the 6-pin ISP header). The Arduino Micro is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4 (datasheet), developed in conjunction with Arduino.cc and Adafruit. Onboard is the processor, crystal, micro USB connection with fuse, Reset button, ISP low-level reprogramming header, ON LED, TX and RX LEDs, a extra user pin #13 LED, and a 3.3V regulator. You'll probably also want to pick up a micro-B USB cable to connect this board to your computer\nYou can use it for basic Arduino sketches as well as USB client projects like making it appear as a mouse or keyboard to your computer! Although it is not shield compatible - it does have all the same pins as a Leonardo. Its best for when you want to shrink your project down or use it on a breadboard. This version of the Micro comes without any header pins and runs at 5V logic with a 16MHz crystal.\n\nFor the Professional Maker: The Adafruit Trinket: A Tiny Dev Board for When a Few I\/O Pins is Enough\nJuly 14, 2017\nThe board features an ATtiny85 microcontroller for processing, giving it 8K of flash memory and five available I\/O pins. When you start a maker project, if you need programmatic control, you may turn to an Arduino board, such as the Uno or Mega, but in many situations, something much smaller would work be preferable. Of course you could turn to the Arduino Nano, as it is quite small, but if you only need a limited number of I\/O, in an even smaller package, the tiny Adafruit Trinket could be exactly what you’re looking for! [Image by lady ada, via Adafruit]\nThe board features an ATtiny85 microcontroller for processing, giving it 8K of flash memory and five available I\/O pins. Two versions are available, one with 5 V logic and 3.3 V logic. Though they mostly function in the same manner, the 3.3 V version is actually slightly smaller at 27 mm x 15 mm versus the slightly “less tiny” 5 V footprint of 31 mm x 15.5 mm. By default, the ATtiny85 runs at 8 MHz, however the 5 V version can be set to 16 MHz if you prefer. You can also set the 3.3 V version to 16 MHz, though as outlined here, this isn’t officially supported, and may not run properly. If that number of I\/O sounds a little low to you, then there is more bad news: two of them are also used for USB communication. This limits their usefulness if you need to reprogram the chip without disconnecting these pins or if you’re going to use it as a virtual keyboard. This does bring up an excellent feature of the Trinket: it can be plugged into a computer and will act as an HMI device (virtual keyboard), so if you need an extra hotkey (or three), you can connect one of these devices to your computer and program it to emulate a keyboard press when it gets an input. [Image by lady ada, via Adafruit]\nTo program the board, when you plug the board into your computer via the micro USB connector (or if you hit the reset button), it goes into bootloader mode for 10 seconds, flashing the red light until it times out. During this time you can send it your program via the Arduino IDE Arduino IDE in the same way that you send a program to an Arduino Board, or you can use AVRdude if you prefer that method. If you’re using the Arduino IDE, you’ll need to go through a few steps to set it up to send programs to this board, outlined here. Make sure you’re using a good USB cable, as it’s quite frustrating to attempt to interface with a new device only to be stopped by something very basic. Also, if your program takes a while to compile, you may want to start the upload process a few seconds before starting the bootloader in order to give it time to load. [Image by Rick Winscot, via Adafruit]\nPerhaps you think this is interesting, but wonder how this very limited number of of I\/O pins can be used. Though certainly not appropriate for the core of an advanced robotics project, there are many builds that simply require one or two inputs to trigger a certain output, and the outputs do feature a variety of functions like analog inputs and PWM outputs. Plus, if you want to leave it in your device, Trinket’s list price of $6.95 means that this won’t be too hard on your wallet. For an interesting example, this colorful tree topper was built with a Trinket, or you can build a computer volume knob using its HMI capabilities referenced earlier!\n\nNow bear in mind that I am a mature Englishman, so when I talk boards I am not looking at the sort of thing that you see on the US Pacific coast and that the Beach Boys sang about. (There, that rather demonstrated “maturity”. For those of you wondering what I am on about, the Beach Boys were a Californian 1960s band who sang about surfing, cars and girls – very exotic in early 1960’s, pre-swinging London.) Instead we are looking at Raspberry Pi and its rivals, which have sparked off a whole new wave of tinkerers – a new type of tinkerer, who plays with hardware at a module level and with software. A distinctive feature of these board families is that they all have developed a strong, web-based community, where community members share projects, problems and successes. We are going to have a quick survey of BeagleBoard, PandaBoard, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. All of these, with the exception of Raspberry Pi, are aimed at the top-end hobbyist, tinkerer or in-house engineer exploring options. They are normally small boards, around the size of a credit card or a playing card, usually with the option for plugging in other cards and a range of I.O. options, including USB. Raspberry Pi is probably the best known. A bunch of Cambridge University guys were unhappy that their new students were no longer hobbyist programmers; instead they were largely computer users, often games players and occasional website developers. To help to get around this, the team designed a bare-bones computer that required only a keyboard, a TV screen, and a power supply. This was launched three years ago, and the 5 millionth board has just been sold. The design, controlled by the Raspberry Pi foundation, uses an ARM 11 based Broadcom processor, which also has an on-board video processor. The second generation Raspberry Pi was launched only a few weeks ago, with the Broadcom SoC upgraded to a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 and a dual-core VideoCore GPU. The board now has 1 GB of on-board memory. The board is manufactured and sold by two of the world’s largest distis, RS Components and Newark element 14 (Premier Farnell). Both host significant community websites, and the foundation website lists many more sites. While some are backed by commercial organisations selling add-on boards, etc., the bulk of them are run by enthusiasts: clearly the hobbyist is back out in force again. When you start looking, the range of projects is amazing, and the community is staggering in its generosity. There are multiple operating systems configured for Raspberry Pi, and a wide range of programming languages; there is currently work underway to certify a Raspberry Pi board for space, linked to a school’s competition to develop programmes to be run in space; and the community is planning a massive series of events on Pi Day (you do know what Pi Day is, don’t you? Well, if you live in the US and use their weird month\/day\/year dating system the 14th of March is 3\/14. Pi, of course is 3.14 to two decimal places, so March 14th is Pi Day. Ok – it wasn’t my idea.) But back to the boards, there will be Pi Day events at, for example, the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California, as part of the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, and at other venues. The official page on the foundation website is adding things every day. The Raspberry Pi Foundation admits it severely underestimated interest in the board, and it had to struggle in the early days to meet demand. It also did not expect it to be used in commercial products. As part of the launch for Raspberry Pi 2, it said that the earlier boards would continue in production “to meet the requirements of commercial customers.” Companies have found that, in particular for consumer products, the board provides a great platform to build on. Arduino also started as a way to get students more involved, but this time from a hardware perspective. The board was developed, in Italy, as a platform for learning about developing interactive applications. The founding team have worked with Smart Projects in Italy and SparkFun electronics in the US to produce families of boards, although, as the board design is open source, other companies have built commercial boards but are not allowed to use the Arduino name, so you have, for instance, Boarduino. Full details are available for someone to build their own board.\n\nQuestion:Which Arduino board would you recommend for large-scale projects requiring extra memory and pins?\n\n",

            "passage": "Step 1: What is Arduino? Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.",

            "passage": "Choosing an Arduino for Your Project\nThe next step in the Arduino evolutionary chain was merging the USB-to-Serial programming part of the board onto the main MCU. That meant we had to leave the ATmega328 behind -- because it doesn't natively support USB -- in favor of the ATmega32U4. Aside from the additional USB support, the 32U4 is largely similar to the 328. Both are 8-bit AVRs with 32kB of flash memory, 22-ish I\/O lines, ADCs, UARTs, timers, etc. These ATmega32U4 boards often have the benefit of being cheaper than the ATmega328-based boards -- there's one less costly IC to put on there. They can also do things regular Arduino boards can't, like emulate a USB keyboard\/mouse. On the downside, they can be less reliable, and more difficult to use. The Leonardo is the patriarch of all ATmega32U4 Arduino boards. It shares the same form factor and I\/O placement (analog, PWM, I2C pins in the same place) as the Arduino Uno, so it remains shield compatible. Arduino Leonardo with HeadersDEV-11286\nDifferences between the Leonardo and the Uno? Aside from the new microcontroller, and lack of a second USB-to-Serial-converting IC, there's not many. The USB connector is different, the Leonardo connects to a computer via a micro-B USB cable. The driver installation process is also a bit more involved -- sometimes it can take a little extra fidgeting to get the board installed on your computer. Just as the Pro Mini took the guts of the Arduino Uno and shrunk them down, the Pro Micro works as a miniature version of the Leonardo. Unlike the Pro Mini, the Pro Micro doesn't require an external board to upload a sketch -- the 32U4 takes care of everything! Pro Micros are among the more complicated Arduino boards to get up and running. There are extra steps required to enable them in your Arduino environment, and a misstep can (at least temporarily) \"brick\" the Pro Micro. These boards are a good choice if you're an advanced Arduino-er and have a small USB-oriented project in mind (a mini USB keyboard\/mouse?). There are plenty of other riffs on the Leonardo design as well. There's the Fio v3, for any Arduino Leonardo project you might want to add an XBee to. Or the Qduino Mini which adds a LiPo charger and battery fuel gauge, and two RGB LEDs (one for status and another that is user programmable!). The board was designed by Quin at the age of 14 and manufactured at SparkFun. Bare Conductive Touch Board\nThen there is the Bare Conductive touch board. Basically it is a Arduino Leonardo designed to turn almost any material or surface into a sensor. The board comes with a built-in capacitive touch sensor, a MP3 decoder IC, microSD card socket, and LiPo charge IC to create light switches, musical instruments, custom interactive surfaces.",

Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.",

Warning: Unlike other Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I\/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I\/O pin could damage the board. If you are looking to interface 5V based product to the due we recommend using the Adafruit 8 channel bi-directional level converter. The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet). It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, CAN bus, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. If you're curious to what the erase button does well it.....hmmm....how can we put this?....it swiftly eliminates the sketch you've uploaded to it....and in other terms: it erases your sketch. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout. Some interesting applications for the Due:\nFeatures and Specs:\n|Input Voltage (recommended)||7-12V|\n|Input Voltage (limits)||6-20V|\n|Digital I\/O Pins||54 (of which 12 provide PWM output)|\n|Analog Input Pins||12|\n|Analog Outputs Pins||2 (DAC)|\n|Total DC Output Current on all I\/O lines||130 mA|\n|DC Current for 3.3V Pin||800 mA|\n|DC Current for 5V Pin||800 mA|\n|Flash Memory||512 KB all available for user applications|\n|SRAM||96 KB (two banks: 64KB and 32KB)|\n|Clock Speed||84 MHz|\nThe Due follows the 1.0 pinout:\nThe Due has a dedicated forum for discussing the board. Here is the specification page for more info. Note: You will have download the newer Arduino 1.5 and above in order to have the Due board available in the IDE. If you do any work with the ATtiny cores you will have to temporarily remove the \"hardware\" folder from your main Arduino Sketch folder or the Arduino 1.5.1 IDE will crash on boot.

Arduino announces the release of the new Arduino Due board based on the Cortex M3 ARM processor\nThe release of the 1.0 Arduino platform in 2011 represented a milestone for Open Source Hardware: after six years of development, Arduino is declared mature and stable. Once this was achieved, the team applied itself to the new version of Arduino designed to provide more creative options to users. The result of this work is the Arduino Due, a board that provides increased performance and faster connectivity at an affordable price (49 USD MSRP). Arduino Due is ideal for those who want to build projects that require high computing power such as the remotely-controlled drones that, in order to fly, need to process a lot of sensor data per second. Arduino Due gives students the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the ARM processor in a cheaper and much simpler way than before. To Scientific projects, which need to acquire data quickly and accurately, Arduino Due provides a platform to create open source tools that are much more advanced than those available now. The new platform enables the open source digital fabrication community (3d Printers, Laser cutters, CNC milling machines) to achieve higher resolutions and faster speed with fewer components than in the past. Main features of Arduino Due\n• The board is equipped with a SAM3X8E processor from Atmel, based on the 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz. • USB 2.0 interface running at 480 Megabits that allows Arduino Due to act as a USB Host (so you can interface it to USB devices like mice, keyboards, cameras, mobile phones and more). Arduino Due supports the Android ADK 2012 protocol. • 12 analog inputs (ADC) with 12-bit resolution and high speed, opening the door to audio applications and signal processing projects that were impossible with Arduino Uno. • High-resolution Analog outputs (DAC). The board provides two 12-bit outputs that can be used to generate audio signals. The Arduino Due software comes with software examples for a WAV and OGG player. • 4 high-speed serial communication ports. • 70 input\/output pins. • High-speed CAN interface. The CAN protocol is used in the automotive industry to network the different components of the car, is now becoming popular in the field of industrial automation thanks to its speed and ability to withstand electrical noise. • 12 PWM channels. • 2 I2C bus.

            "passage": "\"Arduino\" is an open-source set of hardware and software designed around the ATMEGA series of microcontrollers. These are entire computers contained within a single chip.. with one of these chips, and a small number of external components, you have the framework for complex electronic projects and intelligent devices. It's intended to be used by people not normally interested in getting their hands dirty in the inner workings- artists (kinetic sculptures), robot builders, students, and prototyping hobbyists. In short, it simplifies the process of creating a special-purpose \"smart\" device. When referencing Arduino, many people refer to the entire package- the chip, the on-chip boot software, and the programming environment- as a single unit. In reality, nearly all aspects can be changed- the chips and hardware come in several flavors, as do boot software and the programming environment. To deviate from the \"package\" is fine, but with certain tradeoffs. Different flavor of hardware offer varying feature sets like memory size and operating speeds, while different development software platforms provide varying levels of programming ease traded off against efficiency. Development languages run the gamut- from simplified Firmata Scripting to Assembly Language coding (not for the faint of heart). There are even compiled and interpreted forms of BASIC which can be used. Because it provides a nice balance of simplicity and power, at least at the outset I will be using the Arduino development language, which is similar to \"C\" and based on a scripting language called Wiring. If you have ever done Java, Pascal, C++, or similar coding, then Arduino code should be easy to adapt to. Since this is mainly a command and control device, and we don't want to get too bogged down in syntax, the Arduino language and IDE will serve nicely while still keeping the code simple.. I'm a firm believer that keeping things simple makes for a better outcome. One nice aspect of the wide support base is that you can choose what you use- you don't need to change hardware if you change programming language and vice versa. To start off, I chose a variant of the Arduino called a Boarduino. I chose this variant because it offered several benefits for me over the \"Off the Rack\" standard Arduino. First, the Boarduino came as a self-assemble kit, not a finished product. It's been some time since I had done much electronic assembly, and considered that a well-designed kit would give me some much-needed practice soldering and handling components, while still being a project needing only an hour or so of relatively simple work. Secondly, the Boarduino design minimizes the component count, minimizing the complexity. Lastly, the Boarduino is extremely inexpensive, with the module components totalling around $15 per module, making it reasonable to dedicate a module to a \"permanent\" project. The absolute minimum hardware implementation of the chip circuit can be had for under $10 on eBay and other online vendors as of July 2010. Though underpowered for some of the projects I intend, there are Atmel processors which scale down to an eight-pin chip selling for under $2 each which still maintains a substantial amount of the function contained in the Atmega328\/Arduino platform. Conversely, Atmel and others produce similar but far more powerful devices at substantially higher cost also. For my purposes, the chosen platform offers a nice blend of power while still fitting into a Hobby budget. Boarduino kit, Assembled. The birth of a new machine. Boarduino kit, purchased locally but designed and sold by Adafruit. The local seller is actually a college student who is an avid fan of the Arduino\/Atmega platform. In addition to the components and board for the Boarduino itself, included was a kit-form interface card to allow a home computer to communicate with it via a PC serial port, a solderless prototyping breadboard, and a small assortment of components (LED's, resistors, etc) to start out with. Assembled Boarduino parked happily on the breadboard. Online assembly instructions for the module were fairly good, and would be able to be read and followed by a high school student with relative ease. Even before I first powered it, I've decided this module would make an EXCELLENT project for any tech-minded teen. Not only is the kit manageable, the module, when done, opens worlds of experiments for an inquisitive and creative mind.",

When you start a maker project, if you need programmatic control, you may turn to an Arduino board, such as the Uno or Mega, but in many situations, something much smaller would work be preferable. Of course you could turn to the Arduino Nano, as it is quite small, but if you only need a limited number of I\/O, in an even smaller package, the tiny Adafruit Trinket could be exactly what you’re looking for! [Image by lady ada, via Adafruit]\nThe board features an ATtiny85 microcontroller for processing, giving it 8K of flash memory and five available I\/O pins. Two versions are available, one with 5 V logic and 3.3 V logic. Though they mostly function in the same manner, the 3.3 V version is actually slightly smaller at 27 mm x 15 mm versus the slightly “less tiny” 5 V footprint of 31 mm x 15.5 mm. By default, the ATtiny85 runs at 8 MHz, however the 5 V version can be set to 16 MHz if you prefer. You can also set the 3.3 V version to 16 MHz, though as outlined here, this isn’t officially supported, and may not run properly. If that number of I\/O sounds a little low to you, then there is more bad news: two of them are also used for USB communication. This limits their usefulness if you need to reprogram the chip without disconnecting these pins or if you’re going to use it as a virtual keyboard. This does bring up an excellent feature of the Trinket: it can be plugged into a computer and will act as an HMI device (virtual keyboard), so if you need an extra hotkey (or three), you can connect one of these devices to your computer and program it to emulate a keyboard press when it gets an input. [Image by lady ada, via Adafruit]\nTo program the board, when you plug the board into your computer via the micro USB connector (or if you hit the reset button), it goes into bootloader mode for 10 seconds, flashing the red light until it times out. During this time you can send it your program via the Arduino IDE Arduino IDE in the same way that you send a program to an Arduino Board, or you can use AVRdude if you prefer that method. If you’re using the Arduino IDE, you’ll need to go through a few steps to set it up to send programs to this board, outlined here. Make sure you’re using a good USB cable, as it’s quite frustrating to attempt to interface with a new device only to be stopped by something very basic. Also, if your program takes a while to compile, you may want to start the upload process a few seconds before starting the bootloader in order to give it time to load. [Image by Rick Winscot, via Adafruit]\nPerhaps you think this is interesting, but wonder how this very limited number of of I\/O pins can be used. Though certainly not appropriate for the core of an advanced robotics project, there are many builds that simply require one or two inputs to trigger a certain output, and the outputs do feature a variety of functions like analog inputs and PWM outputs. Plus, if you want to leave it in your device, Trinket’s list price of $6.95 means that this won’t be too hard on your wallet. For an interesting example, this colorful tree topper was built with a Trinket, or you can build a computer volume knob using its HMI capabilities referenced earlier!",

(There, that rather demonstrated “maturity”. For those of you wondering what I am on about, the Beach Boys were a Californian 1960s band who sang about surfing, cars and girls – very exotic in early 1960’s, pre-swinging London.) Instead we are looking at Raspberry Pi and its rivals, which have sparked off a whole new wave of tinkerers – a new type of tinkerer, who plays with hardware at a module level and with software. A distinctive feature of these board families is that they all have developed a strong, web-based community, where community members share projects, problems and successes. We are going to have a quick survey of BeagleBoard, PandaBoard, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. All of these, with the exception of Raspberry Pi, are aimed at the top-end hobbyist, tinkerer or in-house engineer exploring options. They are normally small boards, around the size of a credit card or a playing card, usually with the option for plugging in other cards and a range of I.O. options, including USB. Raspberry Pi is probably the best known. A bunch of Cambridge University guys were unhappy that their new students were no longer hobbyist programmers; instead they were largely computer users, often games players and occasional website developers. To help to get around this, the team designed a bare-bones computer that required only a keyboard, a TV screen, and a power supply. This was launched three years ago, and the 5 millionth board has just been sold. The design, controlled by the Raspberry Pi foundation, uses an ARM 11 based Broadcom processor, which also has an on-board video processor. The second generation Raspberry Pi was launched only a few weeks ago, with the Broadcom SoC upgraded to a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 and a dual-core VideoCore GPU. The board now has 1 GB of on-board memory. The board is manufactured and sold by two of the world’s largest distis, RS Components and Newark element 14 (Premier Farnell). Both host significant community websites, and the foundation website lists many more sites. While some are backed by commercial organisations selling add-on boards, etc., the bulk of them are run by enthusiasts: clearly the hobbyist is back out in force again. When you start looking, the range of projects is amazing, and the community is staggering in its generosity. There are multiple operating systems configured for Raspberry Pi, and a wide range of programming languages; there is currently work underway to certify a Raspberry Pi board for space, linked to a school’s competition to develop programmes to be run in space; and the community is planning a massive series of events on Pi Day (you do know what Pi Day is, don’t you? Well, if you live in the US and use their weird month\/day\/year dating system the 14th of March is 3\/14. Pi, of course is 3.14 to two decimal places, so March 14th is Pi Day. Ok – it wasn’t my idea.) But back to the boards, there will be Pi Day events at, for example, the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California, as part of the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, and at other venues. The official page on the foundation website is adding things every day. The Raspberry Pi Foundation admits it severely underestimated interest in the board, and it had to struggle in the early days to meet demand. It also did not expect it to be used in commercial products. As part of the launch for Raspberry Pi 2, it said that the earlier boards would continue in production “to meet the requirements of commercial customers.” Companies have found that, in particular for consumer products, the board provides a great platform to build on. Arduino also started as a way to get students more involved, but this time from a hardware perspective. The board was developed, in Italy, as a platform for learning about developing interactive applications. The founding team have worked with Smart Projects in Italy and SparkFun electronics in the US to produce families of boards, although, as the board design is open source, other companies have built commercial boards but are not allowed to use the Arduino name, so you have, for instance, Boarduino.

Julie Payette, a former astronaut, spoke without notes from the floor of the house — she didn’t like being on the Speaker’s platform, she said to chuckles. During a lively speech from the heart, Payette outlined her long-standing “love relationship” with Alberta — skiing in the Rockies from a young age, survival training in 1993 at Jasper Lake and “the best hamburger in the world” she ate afterwards in Hinton, a 1999 visit when she and the five members of her space crew went to the Edmonton Science Centre then crammed into a 1971 Cutlass and drove to Calgary, receiving honours at the Stampede. Flying in space, the planet makes little distinction, she said. “We share a vast, diverse, spectacular country, all of us, and we work together to accomplish things,” she said. “One of the greatest privileges that we get when we see the planet from above is to see with perspective, to realize how important and precious home is, and how much we need to put in some work.”\n“We can’t be complacent.”\nBut Payette also had a caution of sorts. “Things change. We can’t be complacent. I know that you will continue to do what you do so well in this room. You will continue to look out for those who have less,” she said. It’s important to stand up for those who can’t, she said, and welcome people who seek harbour, and use the land intelligently. Payette also spoke of her wish for MLAs to “reach across differences and also seek opportunities for more collaboration and team work.”\n“Never cease to base your judgment on facts and evidence, to be curious, and to ask questions, because that is the premise by which we find solutions,” she said. Hundreds go out to greet Payette\nPayette’s speech was the third time in history a governor general has addressed the Alberta legislature. It also marked Payette’s first official visit to the province after being sworn in as Canada’s 29th representative of the Queen in October. Her visit began with the boom of cannons — a 21-gun salute as part of military honours. Around 100 members of the public welcomed Payette to Edmonton, watching as a guard of honour marched onto the grounds just after 9:30 a.m.\nPayette arrived around 10 a.m., greeted at the foot of the legislature stairs by Premier Rachel Notley with a handshake and a “Welcome to Alberta.”\nAfter the military honours, the ceremony moved inside to the rotunda, which was packed with MLAs, staffers and school groups. Clutching a small bouquet, Payette put her hand on her heart and wound her way around a fountain to greet children, seniors and a small group of veterans. After her speech to MLAs, Payette headed to CanmetENERGY Devon, and on Tuesday night was set to attend an official welcome reception at Government House. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to travel to Calgary, where she and Dr. Robert Thirsk, another former astronaut, are set to visit Robert Thirsk High School and talk with students about space exploration and the feasibility of reaching Mars. She will also visit WinSport and the NeuroArm at the University of Calgary.\n\nThere's no Nipissing-Harris electoral riding. No Shawinigan-Chrétien. But just four years after it hurried former premier Ralph Klein from office, Alberta's Progressive Conservative government has moved to immortalize his name in the form of a riding. Calgary-North Hill is set to become Calgary-Klein this fall, marking the latest such example of a practice that's embraced here in Alberta - and rare in every other province. Alberta's first premier, Alexander Rutherford, and successors Ernest Manning and Peter Lougheed have ridings named after them or their families. Other ridings are named after a host of other politicians, including onetime Edmonton and Calgary mayors Laurence Decore and Harry Hays. Happily bucking the national trend, Alberta has wasted no time in bestowing the tradition on the polarizing Mr. Klein, 68. Mr. Lougheed had been the only person to receive such an honour while still alive, but the riding is named for his family. Calgary-Klein is named exclusively for Mr. Klein, who will also be very much alive to see the result. \"Sometimes we wait too long to honour people,\" said Kyle Fawcett, explaining the haste. Mr. Fawcett is the first-term MLA who represents the riding, which sits north of downtown in an inner suburb, bounded by freeways and gritty 16th Avenue and including a cemetery and two golf courses. It also includes Mr. Klein's home neighbourhood of Tuxedo Park. Last week, Mr. Fawcett formally proposed the change. The idea was adopted as an amendment to a report, partly to avoid confusion - Calgary would otherwise have had provincial ridings of Nose Hill, North Hill and Northern Hills. Mr. Fawcett expects a bill finalizing the change will pass in this autumn's brief legislative session. \"Ralph was at times controversial, but I think that's sort of what made him Ralph,\" Mr. Fawcett said. Controversial, to say the least. While many here agree with Mr. Fawcett, others remember a different Ralph - a man who famously threw money at a homeless person after grilling him on why he doesn't have a job; who drank heavily; and who frequently clashed with Ottawa over a series of issues affecting his province, including a stand against same-sex marriage. Now, the populist leader is being canonized in Alberta politics while others are left out - among them Mr. Klein's predecessor, Don Getty. Opposition politicians, typically wary of attacking retired opponents, criticize the move. \"There would be tremendous public discomfort with Klein's name being put forward in this way, because he's such a controversial figure,\" said Rachel Notley, a New Democract MLA. A movement to name a riding after her father, former New Democrat leader Grant Notley, failed earlier this year. \"The whole process is a grossly partisan process.\" Others suggest Mr. Klein's legacy isn't worthy of the honour. Mr. Rutherford was the province's first premier, Mr. Manning its longest-serving, and Mr. Lougheed a champion of provincial energy rights. Mr. Klein paid off the province's debt, but has few other hallmark achievements. \"What's the guy's legacy in Alberta? What is it he accomplished?\" asked Nelson Wiseman, a political scientist at the University of Toronto. \"I don't think it's proper, especially when the guy's alive and also still a divisive figure.\" Across Canada, a handful of ridings at the provincial and federal level have been named for deceased former leaders. Among them is B.C. 's federal riding of Burnaby-Douglas, a nod to both governor James Douglas and health-care pioneer Tommy Douglas. In Quebec, the ridings of René-Lévesque, Johnson and Jean-Lesage were all named for former premiers after their deaths. The federal riding of Bourassa is named after publisher Henri Bourassa, not former premier Robert Bourassa. In Ontario, ridings such as Elgin, Brant, Simcoe and York share names with long-deceased leaders, but also with communities within the riding.\n\nAnd while the hurting hasn’t stopped, she feels pride in knowing her son did the right thing, she said. “I’ve lost my son, but he became part of history.”\nThe highest honor\nThe Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces. It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq. There were no Medals of Honor awarded during Operation Desert Storm or operations in Grenada, Panama and Lebanon. Source: U.S. Army\nAwards by service\nAlthough soldiers have received the lion’s share of the nation’s highest military award, Marines, sailors, airmen and one Coast Guardsman have earned the Medal of Honor as well. Here’s how the medals have been split among the services:\nAir Force: 17\nMarine Corps: 296\nCoast Guard: 1\nSource: Congressional Medal of Honor Society\n\nLater, the founders of a new Lodge, principally from Australia, who\nhad landed in Vancouver after participating in the Klondike Gold\nRush, was granted permission to implement the ritual adopted in New\nSouth Wales, described as an impressive and eridite ritual made up\nfrom what a committee deemed the best of the Irish, English and\nScottish rituals. This Lodge became Lodge Southern Cross # 44 in\nThus we find there are four types of rituals being excercised in\nB.C. Canadian ( Ontario ), American, English, and New South Wales. It is also interesting to note that some of the American Lodges use\nthe 'Look to the East' ritual book of Ralph P. LESTER, which is\nconsidered spurious by many jurisdictions. Finally I will endeavour to summarize our beginnings in our own\nProvince of Alberta. The original Masonic Lodge chartered from the\nGrand Lodge of Manitoba was Saskatchewan Lodge # 17 which met at\nEdmonton. There is no relationship to our present day Lodge by the\nsame name. It was dispensated on 13 January 1882, instituted 13 Feb\n1882, and constituted 21 April 1883. They elected Phillip HERMINCK worshipful Master, James KERNSHAN\nSenior Warden, Ralph Robert BURTON Junior Warden. Originally\nstarted by 13 charter members their transient nature so reduced\ntheir numbers that the remaining members felt obliged to surrender\nthe charter to the Grand Lodge of Manitoba. But Alberta Masons were not so easily discouraged., and forty of\nthem met in George MURDOCH's shack in Calgary to organize a Lodge. They subscribed sums of five to twenty five dollars each in either\nmoney or lumber to erect a Lodge in Calgary. It was first decided\nthat they would petition the Grand Lodge of B.C. for dispensation,\nbut it was finally agreed because of the natural barrier of the\nRocky Mountains and the easier access to Winnipeg, they should\napply to the Grand Lodge of Manitoba instead. On 10 January 1884, a dispensation was granted to Bow River Lodge\nto meet at Calgary on the Monday before the full moon. This is what\nis referred to colloqually as \"Moon Lodge.\" It was instituted on\nthe 28 January 1884 and it's charter dated 14 Feb. 1884. 24\npetitioners had recommended that M.J. LINDSAY be Worshipful Master,\nGeorge MURDOCH senior warden, Fred E. NEWMAN Junior Warden. Bow River Lodge members passed a resolution on 14 January 1889,\nthat the Past Masters and the Wardens of the Lodge be formed into a\ncommittee of the Lodge to confer with other Lodges to form a Grand\nLodge. On 20 April 1890 it was decided by the Lodge to grant $200. from the Lodge treasury as a guarantee fund towards the\nestablishment of a Grand Lodge. The members present at that meeting\nalso signed a guarantee amounting to upwards of $300. additionally. It was resolved at the 20 June 1890 meeting that a convention of\nthe Lodges located at Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, Anthracite and\nPincher Creek be held at Calgary with Bow River Lodge to consider\nformation of a Provincial Grand Lodge. Alberta was not yet a\nProvince and this technically presented jurisdictional problems,\nwhich delayed fruitition of this dream until 1905. On 19 April 1905, a communication to Bow River Lodge from\nWorshipful Master Brother O.W. HEALY of Medicine Hat Lodge\nsuggesting a conference of delegates assemble in Calgary on\nVictoria Day, 24 May 1905, to further pursue the subject, was\nreceived. Instead it was decided that a convention of delegates\nappear and present the proposal to the Grand Lodge of Manitoba to\nmeet at Medicine Hat on the Monday before Grand Lodge convened. Worshipful Master Rev.C.W. HOGBIN of Bow River Lodge did call a\nconvention as suggested for 24 May 1905, and the following Lodges\nwere represented there:\nBow River # 28 Medicine Hat # 31 Alberta # 37 MacLEOD PERFECTIUN #\n60 EUREKA # 65 ACACIA # 66 RED DEER # 73 JASPER # 78 WETASKIWIN #\nWorshipful Master Brother HOGBIN was nominated as Chairman, and\nR.W. Brother George MacDONALD as Secretary of the meeting. After\nfull discussion the following resolution was passed: \"That we\nproceed to form a Grand Lodge as soon as possible after 01 July\n1905.\" Again, because Alberta was not a Province yet, the\njurisdictional technicalities delayed their efforts. Finally on 01\nSep 1905, Alberta became a Province.\n\n|— City —|\n|City of Calgary|\n|Nickname: Cowtown, The Stampede City|\n|Coordinates: 51°03′N 114°04′W|\nNovember 7, 1884\n|- City||January 1, 1894|\n|- Mayor||Naheed Nenshi|\n|- Governing body||Calgary City Council|\n|- Manager||Owen A.

The city is located in the south of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) east of the Canadian Rockies. Calgary is well-known as a destination for winter sports and ecotourism with a number of major mountain resorts near the city. Economic activity in Calgary is mostly centered on the petroleum industry; however, agriculture, tourism, and high-tech industries also contribute to the city's fast economic growth. The ascending price of oil in the late 1990s and early 2000s has triggered an economic boom in Calgary with a corresponding influx in population growth. Consequently, the city has one of the fastest growing populations in Canada. Despite the expanding city sprawl, Calgary was ranked the World's Cleanest City by Mercer Quality of Living Survey released by Forbes Magazine in 2007. In 1988, Calgary became the first Canadian city to host the Olympic Winter Games. The metropolis is also home to many major annual festivals including the Calgary Stampede, the Folk Music Festival, the Lilac Festival, Wordfest: Banff-Calgary International Writers Festival, One World Festival (GlobalFest), and the second largest Caribbean festival in the country (Carifest). A resident of Calgary is known as a Calgarian. Before the Calgary area was settled by Europeans, it was inhabited by Pre-Clovis people whose presence has been traced back to at least 11,000 years. In 1787 cartographer David Thompson spent the winter with a band of Piegan encamped along the Bow River. He was the first recorded European to visit the area and John Glenn was the first documented European settler in the Calgary Area, in 1873. The site became a post of the North West Mounted Police (now the RCMP). Originally named Fort Brisebois, after NWMP officer Éphrem-A Brisebois, it was renamed Fort Calgary in 1876 because of questionable conduct on the part of that officer. The NWMP detachment was assigned to protect the western plains from US whiskey traders. Fort Calgary was named by Colonel James Macleod after Calgary (Cala-ghearraidh, Beach of the pasture) on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883 and a rail station was constructed, Calgary began to grow into an important commercial and agricultural centre. The Canadian Pacific Railway headquarters are located in Calgary today. Calgary was officially incorporated as a town in 1884 and elected its first mayor, George Murdoch. In 1894, Calgary became the first city in what was then called the Northwest Territories. Oil was first discovered in Alberta in 1902, but it did not become a significant industry in the province until 1947 when huge reserves of it were discovered. Calgary quickly found itself at the centre of the ensuing oil boom. The city's economy grew when oil prices increased with the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973.\n\nIn 1926, when Baker confronted federal Minister of the Interior Charlie Stewart over his modification of the Territorial Trading and Trafficking Laws (which restricted Baker’s right to trade with the Aboriginal population), Stewart replied, “It wouldn’t be necessary for the new rule if it was not for those damned Syrians and Jews going around fooling the poor Indians!”\nYet Baker proved his commitment to Canada’s highest values when he went on to represent a mostly Aboriginal constituency in the legislature of the Northwest Territories. He is buried in the graveyard of Edmonton’s Al-Rashid mosque, opened in 1938, the oldest mosque in Canada. It’s not surprising that Alberta’s Muslims are inspired by stories such as Peter Baker’s. Encouraged by his example, we have unquestionably thrived. And through it all, our best and brightest—from Larry Shaben, Canada’s first Muslim cabinet minister, who represented the riding of Lesser Slave Lake, to Moe Amery, the current MLA for Calgary–East, to Calgary’s new mayor, Naheed Nenshi—have continued to serve Alberta and show the rest of the country how multiculturalism can work. Given our history in Alberta, one point on which every Muslim will likely agree (and believe me, there aren’t many—we’re as diverse a community as they come) is that we’re wary of the title “newcomer.” Mahdi Qasqas, director of Muslim Youth Services in Calgary, finds the label problematic because it can connote a weak commitment to Canada. Sitting in his office at the back of a converted exercise centre (where the “Love My Curves” logo now reads simply “Love MY,” the “MY” standing for “Muslim Youth”), Qasqas explains, “Even our newest arrivals just want to work and raise their children like everyone else.” In other words, Muslims come to Canada to be Canadians, to enjoy the much-envied freedoms and opportunities of Canadians—not to make this country resemble the place they left. In truth, “newcomers” is perhaps a designation we all share—Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Canadian history didn’t begin with John Cabot in 1497 when he claimed what is now Newfoundland for God and England. The first ocean voyagers to come to Canada’s shores were the Vikings, bringing All-Father Odin. The next explorer to make it here was Chinese-Muslim admiral Zheng He. However, the distinction of being the “first-discoverer” will always belong to the first man, woman or child who crossed the Bering Strait land bridge from Siberia over 40,000 years ago. According to the Huron Carol, which I learned way back in grade school in Ontario, the people who discovered North America were partial to Gitchi Manitou. The thing is: God, Odin, Allah and Gitchi Manitou are all understood by their worshippers as being inadequate names for the same God-concept: the one who made us all and wants us to treat each other with respect. Rather than being the name of some “foreign” non-Christian God—as portrayed by non-Muslim preachers such as evangelical leader Franklin Graham—Allah is even the word that Arabic-speaking Christians use when they’re talking either to or about God. Ever since Islam began under Muhammad (after which name Muslims respectfully add “peace be upon him,” as they do after naming every prophet, including Jesus, peace be upon him) people who live by Muhammad’s example, regardless of their language, have revered and protected the path to worship of other believers, whether Muslim or not. Muhammad’s society in Medina promised equivalent status, rights, roles and responsibilities for all, regardless of race or religion. Muhammad’s Islam affirms women as the equals of men. Muhammad appointed a woman named Um-Waraqah an imam. When the first Muslims took over Jerusalem, they hallowed the Western Wall of the Old Temple and even allowed the Jews—who’d been evicted by the Christians—back in. And a Christian monastery still sits at the foot of Mount Sinai, where they cherish a document in which Muhammad promises religious freedom and Muslim protection to “all those who adopt Christianity both near and far,” and in which Muhammad makes his promises binding on all other Muslims until the end of time.\n\nMount Assiniboine, also known as Assiniboine Mountain, is a pyramidal peak mountain located on the Great Divide, in British Columbia.

At 11,870 ft, it is the highest peak in the Southern Continental Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. Mt. Assiniboine rises nearly 1,525 m (5,003 ft) above Lake Magog. Because of its resemblance to the Matterhorn in the Alps, it is nicknamed the \"Matterhorn of the Rockies\". Mt. Assiniboine was named by George M. Dawson in 1885. When Dawson saw Mt. Assiniboine from Copper Mountain, he saw a plume of clouds trailing away from the top. This reminded him of the plumes of smoke emanating from the teepees of Assiniboine Indians. Mt. Assiniboine lies on the border between Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, in British Columbia, and Banff National Park, in Alberta. The park does not have any roads and thus can only be reached by a six-hour hike or horse-pack 27 km, three-hour bike ride (now disallowed to reduce human \/ grizzly encounters) or helicopter. The usual approach is via Bryant Creek. From Canmore follow the Smith-Dorien road to the Mount Shark parking lot. The trail is well signed. A helipad is also here.\n\nFirst Nations in Alberta\nFirst Nations in Alberta are indigenous peoples who live in the Canadian province of Alberta. The First Nations are those peoples (or nations) recognized as Aboriginal peoples in Canada excluding the Inuit and the Métis. According to the Canadian census, in 2001 a population of 84,990 Albertans reported a \"North American Indian\" (i.e. First Nations) identity, rising to 116,670 in 2011 or 13.7% of all First Nations people in Canada, giving Alberta the third largest First Nations population among the provinces and territories (after Ontario and BC). From this total around half of the population lives on an Indian reserve (58,782 Registered Indians lived on-reserve in Alberta in 2005). The rest of the population lives off-reserve, amongst the rest of the Canadian population. Many of these are urban Aboriginals living in cities, especially Edmonton (the provincial capital) which had an off-reserve status population of 18,210 people in 2011, the second highest for any city in Canada (after Winnipeg). Besides this there were 19,945 people in Alberta in 2011 who claimed a North American Indian identity on the census but are not part of the official Indian Register; such people are commonly called \"non-status Indians\". There are 48 First Nations or \"bands\" in Alberta (in the sense of governments made up of a council and a chief), belonging to nine different ethnic groups or \"tribes\" based on their ancestral languages. There are a variety of ways of classifying the various First Nations groups in Alberta. In anthropological terms there are two broad cultural groupings in Alberta based on different climactic\/ecological regions and the ways of life adapted to those regions. In the northern part of the province the Subarctic peoples relied on boreal species such as moose, woodland caribou, etc. as their main prey animals, extensively practised ice fishing, and utilized canoes, snowshoes, and toboggans for transportation. The Plains Indians of the south lived primarily in a prairie grasslands environment (but with access as well to the nearby Rocky Mountains) and relied on the plains bison (or \"buffalo\") as their major food source and used the travois for transportation. Peoples in the central, aspen parkland belt of Alberta practised hybrid cultures with features of both the aforementioned groups. At the time of contact with Euro-Canadian observers, all of the indigenous peoples in Alberta belonged to several overlapping groups: lodges, bands, tribes, and confederacies. The smallest unit was the lodge, which is what observers called an extended family or any other group living in the same dwelling such as a teepee or wigwam. Several lodges living together formed a band. Bands were highly mobile small groups consisting of a respected (male) leader sometimes called a chief, possibly his extended family, and other unrelated families. The band was a fundamental unit of organization, as a band was large enough to defend itself and engage in communal hunts, yet small enough to be mobile and to make decisions by consensus (leaders had only charismatic authority and no coercive power). Lodges and individuals were free to leave bands, and bands regularly split in two or merged with another, yet no one would want to be without the protection of living in a band for very long. Bands among the Peigan people in southern Alberta ranged in size from 10 to 30 lodges, or about 80 to 240 persons. By contrast, a tribe is an ethnic affiliation. A tribe is group of people who recognize each other as compatriots due to shared language and culture. Bands from the same tribe, speaking the same language, usually relied on each other as allies against outsiders, but in Alberta tribes were not institutionalized, and decision making consisted of leaders from various bands meeting together in council to reach consensus. There are approximately nine indigenous ethnic or tribal groups in Alberta in the twenty-first century, depending on how they are counted.\n\nThe advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east-central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the buffalo bean, fleabane, and sagebrush. Both yellow and purple clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically birch, poplar, and tamarack. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. Aspen poplar, balsam poplar (or cottonwood), and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include Jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, Lodgepole pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack. The First Nations settled the plains about 8,000 years ago, sustaining themselves by hunting the buffalo. Evidence of their activities can still be seen at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, which is now a World Heritage Site in southern Alberta. These peoples included the Blackfoot, Blood, and Peigan. Another group of First Nations, including the Woodland Cree and Chippewa tribes, settled the woodland areas of central Alberta. They hunted caribou and moose and fished the lakes and rivers, using bark canoes to travel. During the nineteenth century, European fur traders married Native women. The children of these marriages are called Métis (meaning \"mixed\"). Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park protects the largest concentration of rock art on the North American Plains. The first European arrived in what is now Alberta in 1754. Anthony Henday, a Hudson's Bay Company fur trader, came seeking a trading agreement with the First Nations that occupied the territory. Prior to this, Alberta was part of Rupert's Land from the time of the incorporation of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670. For the next hundred years fur trading dominated most of Alberta. From the arrival of the North-West Company in 1731, communities began to arise. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752. The North-West Company of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond, who, on behalf of the North-West Company of Montreal, built Fort Athabasca on Lac La Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then on foot trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river that bears his name, which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. He thus became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico. To compete with Alexander Mackenzie, the Hudson's Bay Company sent out surveyors Peter Fidler and David Thompson to map and explore the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Rivers. By 1790, both companies had competing posts near and across what is now northern and central Alberta. With increased competition, however, came violence, and by 1821 with some persuasion from the British government, the North-West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company. By 1870, the fur trade industry was rapidly declining. On June 23, 1870, the Canadian government took possession of all HBC territory (Rupert’s Land), which included the area now known as Alberta. By the late 1850s, the Canadian government had hired John Palliser and his team to explore the arable lands of Alberta. The team, also known as the \"Palliser Expedition,\" discovered many coal deposits and passages through the Rocky Mountains appropriate for the construction of a railroad.\n\nCalgary is the largest city in the province of Alberta in Canada, situated at about 80 km east at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the hills and prairies of the Canadian basin. The city is one of the sunniest in Canada. The sun shines here on average 2,400 hours per year. The Calgary center height above the sea level is about 1048 m. Calgary life revolves around extracting oil, found here in the early 20th century. Despite this, the city is considered by many people one of the cleanest cities in the world. Surrounded by the majestic Rocky Mountains with the famous ski resorts and the magnificent landscaped parks, Calgary dates back to 1875, when at the intersection of the Bow and Elbow rivers was the Mounted Police fort called \"Calgary \" fort meaning \" clean running water \" in honor of the same bay, and in 1894, Calgary received the status of a major city. Although the history of Calgary has just over 100 years, the city is famous for its attractions and major events: from the opening of oil and gas in the capital of Calgary, Canada to the Olympic Games. In 1988 the Winter Olympic Games had been held here, fact which made the town famous in the world. Today, millions of tourists from all over the world come to Calgary - a beautiful modern city with glittering skyscrapers, comfortable hotels, spacious parks, numerous museums, art galleries, sports facilities, shops, restaurants and nightclubs. Magnificent landscapes, great opportunities for different sports, wonderful climate and comfort of the 21st century make Calgary one of the most attractive cities in Canada. \"\" Calgary’s cultural life\nIn 1988, when the Calgary Winter Olympics were held , a new bobsleigh track had been installed underneath, specially for the Games. These are refrigeration units which allow you to store ice even at 20 ° C. The new indoor stadium provides an opportunity to 19 000 spectators to watch the matches of hockey teams and figure skating competitions. There have also been built modern ski and ski slopes, the International Centre for Broadcasting was also put into effect. The city is world famous for its annual rodeo Calgary Stampede and Exhibition. Nothing can be compared with the biggest cowboy holiday parades, performances. Competitions are held within 10 days from the second week of July. Professionals and amateurs with the same scarves and the famous cowboy boots should hold no less than 8 seconds on the back of an unbroken horse, tame a wild mustang or 10 seconds to throw a lasso at the frisky young bull. Calgary lives a rich and varied cultural life: a town of about 500 churches and religious organizations, many theaters, cinemas, opera, ballet, exhibition halls, cultural centers. Shops and shopping malls to suit every taste are located throughout the city, especially the popular shops of the pedestrian zone Stephens Avenue, as well as the following shopping malls: the Calgary Eaton Centre, TD Square and Scotia Centre. Nightlife in Calgary is rich and bright. There are a lot of nightclubs, discos, 18 clubs with live music and more than 70 pubs and sports bars. Calgary is a fairly safe city, but as in all big cities, you must be careful in the areas with large concentrations of people. Surprising neighborhood of Calgary with its clean air, clear skies, perfect conditions for sports and tourism, as well as the lowest crime rate and lack of transport issues make this city one of the most attractive for tourists. This Canadian Centre is visited every year by hundreds of thousands of fans of outdoor activities from different parts of Canada itself, North America and around the world.\n\nQuestion:What is the highest honor in Alberta?",

            "passage": "Albertans must work together and rise above their differences to preserve the province’s strengths, the Governor General told the legislative assembly Tuesday afternoon. Julie Payette, a former astronaut, spoke without notes from the floor of the house — she didn’t like being on the Speaker’s platform, she said to chuckles. During a lively speech from the heart, Payette outlined her long-standing “love relationship” with Alberta — skiing in the Rockies from a young age, survival training in 1993 at Jasper Lake and “the best hamburger in the world” she ate afterwards in Hinton, a 1999 visit when she and the five members of her space crew went to the Edmonton Science Centre then crammed into a 1971 Cutlass and drove to Calgary, receiving honours at the Stampede. Flying in space, the planet makes little distinction, she said. “We share a vast, diverse, spectacular country, all of us, and we work together to accomplish things,” she said. “One of the greatest privileges that we get when we see the planet from above is to see with perspective, to realize how important and precious home is, and how much we need to put in some work.”\n“We can’t be complacent.”\nBut Payette also had a caution of sorts. “Things change. We can’t be complacent. I know that you will continue to do what you do so well in this room. You will continue to look out for those who have less,” she said. It’s important to stand up for those who can’t, she said, and welcome people who seek harbour, and use the land intelligently. Payette also spoke of her wish for MLAs to “reach across differences and also seek opportunities for more collaboration and team work.”\n“Never cease to base your judgment on facts and evidence, to be curious, and to ask questions, because that is the premise by which we find solutions,” she said. Hundreds go out to greet Payette\nPayette’s speech was the third time in history a governor general has addressed the Alberta legislature. It also marked Payette’s first official visit to the province after being sworn in as Canada’s 29th representative of the Queen in October. Her visit began with the boom of cannons — a 21-gun salute as part of military honours. Around 100 members of the public welcomed Payette to Edmonton, watching as a guard of honour marched onto the grounds just after 9:30 a.m.\nPayette arrived around 10 a.m., greeted at the foot of the legislature stairs by Premier Rachel Notley with a handshake and a “Welcome to Alberta.”\nAfter the military honours, the ceremony moved inside to the rotunda, which was packed with MLAs, staffers and school groups. Clutching a small bouquet, Payette put her hand on her heart and wound her way around a fountain to greet children, seniors and a small group of veterans. After her speech to MLAs, Payette headed to CanmetENERGY Devon, and on Tuesday night was set to attend an official welcome reception at Government House. On Wednesday, she is scheduled to travel to Calgary, where she and Dr. Robert Thirsk, another former astronaut, are set to visit Robert Thirsk High School and talk with students about space exploration and the feasibility of reaching Mars. She will also visit WinSport and the NeuroArm at the University of Calgary.",

            "passage": "There's no Nipissing-Harris electoral riding. No Shawinigan-Chrétien. But just four years after it hurried former premier Ralph Klein from office, Alberta's Progressive Conservative government has moved to immortalize his name in the form of a riding. Calgary-North Hill is set to become Calgary-Klein this fall, marking the latest such example of a practice that's embraced here in Alberta - and rare in every other province. Alberta's first premier, Alexander Rutherford, and successors Ernest Manning and Peter Lougheed have ridings named after them or their families. Other ridings are named after a host of other politicians, including onetime Edmonton and Calgary mayors Laurence Decore and Harry Hays. Happily bucking the national trend, Alberta has wasted no time in bestowing the tradition on the polarizing Mr. Klein, 68. Mr. Lougheed had been the only person to receive such an honour while still alive, but the riding is named for his family. Calgary-Klein is named exclusively for Mr. Klein, who will also be very much alive to see the result. \"Sometimes we wait too long to honour people,\" said Kyle Fawcett, explaining the haste. Mr. Fawcett is the first-term MLA who represents the riding, which sits north of downtown in an inner suburb, bounded by freeways and gritty 16th Avenue and including a cemetery and two golf courses. It also includes Mr. Klein's home neighbourhood of Tuxedo Park. Last week, Mr. Fawcett formally proposed the change. The idea was adopted as an amendment to a report, partly to avoid confusion - Calgary would otherwise have had provincial ridings of Nose Hill, North Hill and Northern Hills. Mr. Fawcett expects a bill finalizing the change will pass in this autumn's brief legislative session. \"Ralph was at times controversial, but I think that's sort of what made him Ralph,\" Mr. Fawcett said. Controversial, to say the least. While many here agree with Mr. Fawcett, others remember a different Ralph - a man who famously threw money at a homeless person after grilling him on why he doesn't have a job; who drank heavily; and who frequently clashed with Ottawa over a series of issues affecting his province, including a stand against same-sex marriage. Now, the populist leader is being canonized in Alberta politics while others are left out - among them Mr. Klein's predecessor, Don Getty. Opposition politicians, typically wary of attacking retired opponents, criticize the move. \"There would be tremendous public discomfort with Klein's name being put forward in this way, because he's such a controversial figure,\" said Rachel Notley, a New Democract MLA. A movement to name a riding after her father, former New Democrat leader Grant Notley, failed earlier this year. \"The whole process is a grossly partisan process.\" Others suggest Mr. Klein's legacy isn't worthy of the honour. Mr. Rutherford was the province's first premier, Mr. Manning its longest-serving, and Mr. Lougheed a champion of provincial energy rights. Mr. Klein paid off the province's debt, but has few other hallmark achievements. \"What's the guy's legacy in Alberta? What is it he accomplished?\" asked Nelson Wiseman, a political scientist at the University of Toronto. \"I don't think it's proper, especially when the guy's alive and also still a divisive figure.\" Across Canada, a handful of ridings at the provincial and federal level have been named for deceased former leaders. Among them is B.C. 's federal riding of Burnaby-Douglas, a nod to both governor James Douglas and health-care pioneer Tommy Douglas. In Quebec, the ridings of René-Lévesque, Johnson and Jean-Lesage were all named for former premiers after their deaths. The federal riding of Bourassa is named after publisher Henri Bourassa, not former premier Robert Bourassa. In Ontario, ridings such as Elgin, Brant, Simcoe and York share names with long-deceased leaders, but also with communities within the riding.",

It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq.

This Lodge became Lodge Southern Cross # 44 in\nThus we find there are four types of rituals being excercised in\nB.C. Canadian ( Ontario ), American, English, and New South Wales. It is also interesting to note that some of the American Lodges use\nthe 'Look to the East' ritual book of Ralph P. LESTER, which is\nconsidered spurious by many jurisdictions. Finally I will endeavour to summarize our beginnings in our own\nProvince of Alberta. The original Masonic Lodge chartered from the\nGrand Lodge of Manitoba was Saskatchewan Lodge # 17 which met at\nEdmonton. There is no relationship to our present day Lodge by the\nsame name. It was dispensated on 13 January 1882, instituted 13 Feb\n1882, and constituted 21 April 1883. They elected Phillip HERMINCK worshipful Master, James KERNSHAN\nSenior Warden, Ralph Robert BURTON Junior Warden. Originally\nstarted by 13 charter members their transient nature so reduced\ntheir numbers that the remaining members felt obliged to surrender\nthe charter to the Grand Lodge of Manitoba. But Alberta Masons were not so easily discouraged., and forty of\nthem met in George MURDOCH's shack in Calgary to organize a Lodge. They subscribed sums of five to twenty five dollars each in either\nmoney or lumber to erect a Lodge in Calgary. It was first decided\nthat they would petition the Grand Lodge of B.C. for dispensation,\nbut it was finally agreed because of the natural barrier of the\nRocky Mountains and the easier access to Winnipeg, they should\napply to the Grand Lodge of Manitoba instead. On 10 January 1884, a dispensation was granted to Bow River Lodge\nto meet at Calgary on the Monday before the full moon. This is what\nis referred to colloqually as \"Moon Lodge.\" It was instituted on\nthe 28 January 1884 and it's charter dated 14 Feb. 1884. 24\npetitioners had recommended that M.J. LINDSAY be Worshipful Master,\nGeorge MURDOCH senior warden, Fred E. NEWMAN Junior Warden. Bow River Lodge members passed a resolution on 14 January 1889,\nthat the Past Masters and the Wardens of the Lodge be formed into a\ncommittee of the Lodge to confer with other Lodges to form a Grand\nLodge. On 20 April 1890 it was decided by the Lodge to grant $200. from the Lodge treasury as a guarantee fund towards the\nestablishment of a Grand Lodge. The members present at that meeting\nalso signed a guarantee amounting to upwards of $300. additionally. It was resolved at the 20 June 1890 meeting that a convention of\nthe Lodges located at Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, Anthracite and\nPincher Creek be held at Calgary with Bow River Lodge to consider\nformation of a Provincial Grand Lodge. Alberta was not yet a\nProvince and this technically presented jurisdictional problems,\nwhich delayed fruitition of this dream until 1905. On 19 April 1905, a communication to Bow River Lodge from\nWorshipful Master Brother O.W. HEALY of Medicine Hat Lodge\nsuggesting a conference of delegates assemble in Calgary on\nVictoria Day, 24 May 1905, to further pursue the subject, was\nreceived. Instead it was decided that a convention of delegates\nappear and present the proposal to the Grand Lodge of Manitoba to\nmeet at Medicine Hat on the Monday before Grand Lodge convened. Worshipful Master Rev.C.W. HOGBIN of Bow River Lodge did call a\nconvention as suggested for 24 May 1905, and the following Lodges\nwere represented there:\nBow River # 28 Medicine Hat # 31 Alberta # 37 MacLEOD PERFECTIUN #\n60 EUREKA # 65 ACACIA # 66 RED DEER # 73 JASPER # 78 WETASKIWIN #\nWorshipful Master Brother HOGBIN was nominated as Chairman, and\nR.W. Brother George MacDONALD as Secretary of the meeting. After\nfull discussion the following resolution was passed: \"That we\nproceed to form a Grand Lodge as soon as possible after 01 July\n1905.\" Again, because Alberta was not a Province yet, the\njurisdictional technicalities delayed their efforts. Finally on 01\nSep 1905, Alberta became a Province.",

The city is located in the south of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) east of the Canadian Rockies. Calgary is well-known as a destination for winter sports and ecotourism with a number of major mountain resorts near the city. Economic activity in Calgary is mostly centered on the petroleum industry; however, agriculture, tourism, and high-tech industries also contribute to the city's fast economic growth. The ascending price of oil in the late 1990s and early 2000s has triggered an economic boom in Calgary with a corresponding influx in population growth. Consequently, the city has one of the fastest growing populations in Canada. Despite the expanding city sprawl, Calgary was ranked the World's Cleanest City by Mercer Quality of Living Survey released by Forbes Magazine in 2007. In 1988, Calgary became the first Canadian city to host the Olympic Winter Games. The metropolis is also home to many major annual festivals including the Calgary Stampede, the Folk Music Festival, the Lilac Festival, Wordfest: Banff-Calgary International Writers Festival, One World Festival (GlobalFest), and the second largest Caribbean festival in the country (Carifest). A resident of Calgary is known as a Calgarian. Before the Calgary area was settled by Europeans, it was inhabited by Pre-Clovis people whose presence has been traced back to at least 11,000 years. In 1787 cartographer David Thompson spent the winter with a band of Piegan encamped along the Bow River. He was the first recorded European to visit the area and John Glenn was the first documented European settler in the Calgary Area, in 1873. The site became a post of the North West Mounted Police (now the RCMP). Originally named Fort Brisebois, after NWMP officer Éphrem-A Brisebois, it was renamed Fort Calgary in 1876 because of questionable conduct on the part of that officer. The NWMP detachment was assigned to protect the western plains from US whiskey traders. Fort Calgary was named by Colonel James Macleod after Calgary (Cala-ghearraidh, Beach of the pasture) on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883 and a rail station was constructed, Calgary began to grow into an important commercial and agricultural centre. The Canadian Pacific Railway headquarters are located in Calgary today. Calgary was officially incorporated as a town in 1884 and elected its first mayor, George Murdoch. In 1894, Calgary became the first city in what was then called the Northwest Territories. Oil was first discovered in Alberta in 1902, but it did not become a significant industry in the province until 1947 when huge reserves of it were discovered. Calgary quickly found itself at the centre of the ensuing oil boom. The city's economy grew when oil prices increased with the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973.",

            "passage": "In 1926, when Baker confronted federal Minister of the Interior Charlie Stewart over his modification of the Territorial Trading and Trafficking Laws (which restricted Baker’s right to trade with the Aboriginal population), Stewart replied, “It wouldn’t be necessary for the new rule if it was not for those damned Syrians and Jews going around fooling the poor Indians!”\nYet Baker proved his commitment to Canada’s highest values when he went on to represent a mostly Aboriginal constituency in the legislature of the Northwest Territories. He is buried in the graveyard of Edmonton’s Al-Rashid mosque, opened in 1938, the oldest mosque in Canada. It’s not surprising that Alberta’s Muslims are inspired by stories such as Peter Baker’s. Encouraged by his example, we have unquestionably thrived. And through it all, our best and brightest—from Larry Shaben, Canada’s first Muslim cabinet minister, who represented the riding of Lesser Slave Lake, to Moe Amery, the current MLA for Calgary–East, to Calgary’s new mayor, Naheed Nenshi—have continued to serve Alberta and show the rest of the country how multiculturalism can work. Given our history in Alberta, one point on which every Muslim will likely agree (and believe me, there aren’t many—we’re as diverse a community as they come) is that we’re wary of the title “newcomer.” Mahdi Qasqas, director of Muslim Youth Services in Calgary, finds the label problematic because it can connote a weak commitment to Canada. Sitting in his office at the back of a converted exercise centre (where the “Love My Curves” logo now reads simply “Love MY,” the “MY” standing for “Muslim Youth”), Qasqas explains, “Even our newest arrivals just want to work and raise their children like everyone else.” In other words, Muslims come to Canada to be Canadians, to enjoy the much-envied freedoms and opportunities of Canadians—not to make this country resemble the place they left. In truth, “newcomers” is perhaps a designation we all share—Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Canadian history didn’t begin with John Cabot in 1497 when he claimed what is now Newfoundland for God and England. The first ocean voyagers to come to Canada’s shores were the Vikings, bringing All-Father Odin. The next explorer to make it here was Chinese-Muslim admiral Zheng He. However, the distinction of being the “first-discoverer” will always belong to the first man, woman or child who crossed the Bering Strait land bridge from Siberia over 40,000 years ago. According to the Huron Carol, which I learned way back in grade school in Ontario, the people who discovered North America were partial to Gitchi Manitou. The thing is: God, Odin, Allah and Gitchi Manitou are all understood by their worshippers as being inadequate names for the same God-concept: the one who made us all and wants us to treat each other with respect. Rather than being the name of some “foreign” non-Christian God—as portrayed by non-Muslim preachers such as evangelical leader Franklin Graham—Allah is even the word that Arabic-speaking Christians use when they’re talking either to or about God. Ever since Islam began under Muhammad (after which name Muslims respectfully add “peace be upon him,” as they do after naming every prophet, including Jesus, peace be upon him) people who live by Muhammad’s example, regardless of their language, have revered and protected the path to worship of other believers, whether Muslim or not. Muhammad’s society in Medina promised equivalent status, rights, roles and responsibilities for all, regardless of race or religion. Muhammad’s Islam affirms women as the equals of men. Muhammad appointed a woman named Um-Waraqah an imam. When the first Muslims took over Jerusalem, they hallowed the Western Wall of the Old Temple and even allowed the Jews—who’d been evicted by the Christians—back in. And a Christian monastery still sits at the foot of Mount Sinai, where they cherish a document in which Muhammad promises religious freedom and Muslim protection to “all those who adopt Christianity both near and far,” and in which Muhammad makes his promises binding on all other Muslims until the end of time.",

Assiniboine from Copper Mountain, he saw a plume of clouds trailing away from the top. This reminded him of the plumes of smoke emanating from the teepees of Assiniboine Indians. Mt. Assiniboine lies on the border between Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, in British Columbia, and Banff National Park, in Alberta. The park does not have any roads and thus can only be reached by a six-hour hike or horse-pack 27 km, three-hour bike ride (now disallowed to reduce human \/ grizzly encounters) or helicopter.

            "passage": "First Nations in Alberta\nFirst Nations in Alberta are indigenous peoples who live in the Canadian province of Alberta. The First Nations are those peoples (or nations) recognized as Aboriginal peoples in Canada excluding the Inuit and the Métis. According to the Canadian census, in 2001 a population of 84,990 Albertans reported a \"North American Indian\" (i.e. First Nations) identity, rising to 116,670 in 2011 or 13.7% of all First Nations people in Canada, giving Alberta the third largest First Nations population among the provinces and territories (after Ontario and BC). From this total around half of the population lives on an Indian reserve (58,782 Registered Indians lived on-reserve in Alberta in 2005). The rest of the population lives off-reserve, amongst the rest of the Canadian population. Many of these are urban Aboriginals living in cities, especially Edmonton (the provincial capital) which had an off-reserve status population of 18,210 people in 2011, the second highest for any city in Canada (after Winnipeg). Besides this there were 19,945 people in Alberta in 2011 who claimed a North American Indian identity on the census but are not part of the official Indian Register; such people are commonly called \"non-status Indians\". There are 48 First Nations or \"bands\" in Alberta (in the sense of governments made up of a council and a chief), belonging to nine different ethnic groups or \"tribes\" based on their ancestral languages. There are a variety of ways of classifying the various First Nations groups in Alberta. In anthropological terms there are two broad cultural groupings in Alberta based on different climactic\/ecological regions and the ways of life adapted to those regions. In the northern part of the province the Subarctic peoples relied on boreal species such as moose, woodland caribou, etc. as their main prey animals, extensively practised ice fishing, and utilized canoes, snowshoes, and toboggans for transportation. The Plains Indians of the south lived primarily in a prairie grasslands environment (but with access as well to the nearby Rocky Mountains) and relied on the plains bison (or \"buffalo\") as their major food source and used the travois for transportation. Peoples in the central, aspen parkland belt of Alberta practised hybrid cultures with features of both the aforementioned groups. At the time of contact with Euro-Canadian observers, all of the indigenous peoples in Alberta belonged to several overlapping groups: lodges, bands, tribes, and confederacies. The smallest unit was the lodge, which is what observers called an extended family or any other group living in the same dwelling such as a teepee or wigwam. Several lodges living together formed a band. Bands were highly mobile small groups consisting of a respected (male) leader sometimes called a chief, possibly his extended family, and other unrelated families. The band was a fundamental unit of organization, as a band was large enough to defend itself and engage in communal hunts, yet small enough to be mobile and to make decisions by consensus (leaders had only charismatic authority and no coercive power). Lodges and individuals were free to leave bands, and bands regularly split in two or merged with another, yet no one would want to be without the protection of living in a band for very long. Bands among the Peigan people in southern Alberta ranged in size from 10 to 30 lodges, or about 80 to 240 persons. By contrast, a tribe is an ethnic affiliation. A tribe is group of people who recognize each other as compatriots due to shared language and culture. Bands from the same tribe, speaking the same language, usually relied on each other as allies against outsiders, but in Alberta tribes were not institutionalized, and decision making consisted of leaders from various bands meeting together in council to reach consensus. There are approximately nine indigenous ethnic or tribal groups in Alberta in the twenty-first century, depending on how they are counted.",

            "passage": "The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east-central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the buffalo bean, fleabane, and sagebrush. Both yellow and purple clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically birch, poplar, and tamarack. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. Aspen poplar, balsam poplar (or cottonwood), and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include Jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, Lodgepole pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack. The First Nations settled the plains about 8,000 years ago, sustaining themselves by hunting the buffalo. Evidence of their activities can still be seen at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, which is now a World Heritage Site in southern Alberta. These peoples included the Blackfoot, Blood, and Peigan. Another group of First Nations, including the Woodland Cree and Chippewa tribes, settled the woodland areas of central Alberta. They hunted caribou and moose and fished the lakes and rivers, using bark canoes to travel. During the nineteenth century, European fur traders married Native women. The children of these marriages are called Métis (meaning \"mixed\"). Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park protects the largest concentration of rock art on the North American Plains. The first European arrived in what is now Alberta in 1754. Anthony Henday, a Hudson's Bay Company fur trader, came seeking a trading agreement with the First Nations that occupied the territory. Prior to this, Alberta was part of Rupert's Land from the time of the incorporation of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670. For the next hundred years fur trading dominated most of Alberta. From the arrival of the North-West Company in 1731, communities began to arise. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752. The North-West Company of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond, who, on behalf of the North-West Company of Montreal, built Fort Athabasca on Lac La Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then on foot trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river that bears his name, which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. He thus became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico. To compete with Alexander Mackenzie, the Hudson's Bay Company sent out surveyors Peter Fidler and David Thompson to map and explore the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Rivers. By 1790, both companies had competing posts near and across what is now northern and central Alberta. With increased competition, however, came violence, and by 1821 with some persuasion from the British government, the North-West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company. By 1870, the fur trade industry was rapidly declining. On June 23, 1870, the Canadian government took possession of all HBC territory (Rupert’s Land), which included the area now known as Alberta. By the late 1850s, the Canadian government had hired John Palliser and his team to explore the arable lands of Alberta. The team, also known as the \"Palliser Expedition,\" discovered many coal deposits and passages through the Rocky Mountains appropriate for the construction of a railroad.",

The city is one of the sunniest in Canada. The sun shines here on average 2,400 hours per year. The Calgary center height above the sea level is about 1048 m. Calgary life revolves around extracting oil, found here in the early 20th century. Despite this, the city is considered by many people one of the cleanest cities in the world. Surrounded by the majestic Rocky Mountains with the famous ski resorts and the magnificent landscaped parks, Calgary dates back to 1875, when at the intersection of the Bow and Elbow rivers was the Mounted Police fort called \"Calgary \" fort meaning \" clean running water \" in honor of the same bay, and in 1894, Calgary received the status of a major city. Although the history of Calgary has just over 100 years, the city is famous for its attractions and major events: from the opening of oil and gas in the capital of Calgary, Canada to the Olympic Games. In 1988 the Winter Olympic Games had been held here, fact which made the town famous in the world. Today, millions of tourists from all over the world come to Calgary - a beautiful modern city with glittering skyscrapers, comfortable hotels, spacious parks, numerous museums, art galleries, sports facilities, shops, restaurants and nightclubs. Magnificent landscapes, great opportunities for different sports, wonderful climate and comfort of the 21st century make Calgary one of the most attractive cities in Canada. \"\" Calgary’s cultural life\nIn 1988, when the Calgary Winter Olympics were held , a new bobsleigh track had been installed underneath, specially for the Games. These are refrigeration units which allow you to store ice even at 20 ° C. The new indoor stadium provides an opportunity to 19 000 spectators to watch the matches of hockey teams and figure skating competitions. There have also been built modern ski and ski slopes, the International Centre for Broadcasting was also put into effect. The city is world famous for its annual rodeo Calgary Stampede and Exhibition. Nothing can be compared with the biggest cowboy holiday parades, performances. Competitions are held within 10 days from the second week of July. Professionals and amateurs with the same scarves and the famous cowboy boots should hold no less than 8 seconds on the back of an unbroken horse, tame a wild mustang or 10 seconds to throw a lasso at the frisky young bull. Calgary lives a rich and varied cultural life: a town of about 500 churches and religious organizations, many theaters, cinemas, opera, ballet, exhibition halls, cultural centers. Shops and shopping malls to suit every taste are located throughout the city, especially the popular shops of the pedestrian zone Stephens Avenue, as well as the following shopping malls: the Calgary Eaton Centre, TD Square and Scotia Centre.

    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: It’s important to be sincere and honest when you’re apologizing for something you’ve done. But does the plural “My apologies” carry more weight than the singular “My apology”? Both phrases refer to a feeling of regret, but only one of them actually means “I’m sorry” (even if you only sort of mean it). “My Apologies” Means “I’m Sorry”\nThe word apology comes from the Greek apologia, meaning “a speech of defense.” Even though apologies is technically the plural version of apology, that’s not how we use it in English. My apologies is an idiom that means “I feel regret” or “I’m sorry.” In this context, my apologies is short for the longer “Please accept my apologies,” which has a similar meaning to “I beg your pardon.”\n- My apologies for bumping into you. - I sent you the wrong directions? My apologies. I’ll send you the correct ones. You can also use my apologies as an idiomatic statement for regret. - Please give Harold my apologies; I won’t be able to attend the wedding. - I made my apologies to the host before leaving early from the party. When Do You Use “My Apologies”? Because my apologies is a more formal expression than “I’m sorry,” you typically use it when:\n- you’re trying to be polite in a social situation (“My apologies, I didn’t see you there.”)\n- you’re RSVPing “no” to an event (“My apologies, I won’t be able to attend.”)\n- you’re addressing a misunderstanding or mistake at work (“My apologies, let me send the attachment again.”)\nNotice that you can separate my apologies from the rest of the sentence with a comma when using it to mean “I’m sorry.”\n“My Apology” Means “That Time I Said I Was Sorry”\nWhen you say “my apology,” you’re referring to a time when you said you were sorry. The noun phrase is a literal description of someone’s statement of regret or remorse, not an idiom for “I’m sorry.”\n- In the letter, I expressed my apology for the unkind things I said. - The newspaper printed my apology in the editorial section. Unlike my apologies, my apology doesn’t just relate to social situations. You also can’t use my apology as a synonym for “I’m sorry.”\nYou express my apology for a specific thing you said or did; you express my apologies for breaking social rules. Is It “Please Accept My Apology” or “Please Accept My Apologies”? The apology vs. apologies debate gets a little tricky when you’re asking someone to accept it (or them). Both “Please accept my apology” and “Please accept my apologies” are correct — depending on the context. - Please accept my apology for breaking your lamp. (You’re apologizing for something specific.) - Please accept my apologies for being late. (You’re being polite.) You may also use “Please accept my apologies” when you’re issuing more than one apology. For example, if you’re apologizing for breaking the lamp, yelling at your friend, slamming their door, spreading rumors about them online, and crashing their car — yeah, you probably owe them more than one apology. But if it’s just one offense, “Please accept my apology” will do it. More Ways To Say “I’m Sorry”\nMy apologies and my apology aren’t the only statements that express remorse. If “I’m sorry” isn’t the right phrase, try:\n- Excuse me\n- Pardon me\n- Please forgive me\n- My bad\n- My mistake\n\nOne of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.\n\nI recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares! We all have high maintenance people in our lives.\n\n‘I’m sorry.’ The two simple yet powerful words couples might have difficulty saying at the right time. As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.\n\nThey're Not Just for Children\nWe learned them as children, but no mater your age these essential words are effortless to say and convey a wealth of meaning to others. They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.\n\nHow To Apologize\nA look into apologies from a neurological intelligence perspective\nWhen I was a kid I did not understand apologies very well. One time at an art day camp I told someone that their artwork looked ugly. He was so upset that he snitched to the camp leader, who made me apologize. I said sorry, and the kid was still upset. They told me to \"Say it like I mean it\" whatever that meant, so I changed my voice to make it sound pitiful and regretful and said sorry again. They preferred the second apology to the first, even though I wasn't any more sorry the second time. I did not learn to apologize better from that exchange, but I did learn that people care a lot and can be very particular about how you apologize. They care because an apology has a purpose. I now know that apologies are supposed to initiate, or facilitate the healing of a broken relationship. If your apology doesn't do that, then others won't accept it. While other people have a very specific expectation of what your apology should look like, you might have different reasons for wanting to apologize. Usually people apologize after they realize that their actions affect themselves or after they realize how their actions affected others. For example, when I hurt the kid's feelings I could have apologized out of fear of the punishment the camp instructor might give me, or I could have apologized because I realized how much I had hurt the kid. The first motivation does not make for a good apology because people want to believe that you care about them. In addition to looking at good and bad apologies we will also be looking at the 5 different methods of apologizing. These methods were found by marriage councilor Gary Chapman. He calls them the languages of apology; they are: expressing regret, restitution, requesting forgiveness, not doing it again, and accepting responsibility. He found these different types of apologies by interviewing people, and asking them \"if you were to apologize to someone how would you do it? \", and \"if someone were to apologize to you how would you want them to do it?\" It turns out that these different types of apologies are rooted in the ethics of neurological intelligence. You can read more about these in my post titled Meta Ethics. As a quick recap the theory states that there are two systems of ethics. The first states that ethical behavior is motivated by preserving or enhancing your identity. This theory is where bad apologies come from. The second states that ethical behavior comes from building or preserving your relationships, this is where good apologies come from. Both systems of ethics have six different ethical principles which define them. The sixth relationship ethic states that you need to show people mercy; one way to do this is through apologizing for the ways that you failed the other ethics. Therefore the sixth ethic is not an apology method, but apologizing itself. Similarly the sixth identity ethic is not a method of making a poor apology, but instead the motivation for making a poor apology. Language 1: Don't Do it Again\nWhen you stop doing something that is wrong you are following the social contracts ethic. This ethic states that the only way to keep people from taking advantage of each other is to make mutually beneficial social contracts. When you stop doing harmful things you show that you are capable of creating and keeping social contracts again. The identity ethic that corresponds to this is the values ethic. It states that the things you believe are right are what is right. If you stop doing the things that you believe are wrong this might be good or bad, that depends on whether you were right or not. But it is not necessarily an apology. For it to be an apology it would have to actually be benefiting others with your change of behavior. Language 2: Restitution\nRestitution means that you try to correct the bad thing you have done. It comes from the common good ethic, which states that in order to reap the greatest benefit from group living you must contribute to the common good of society. When you make restitution you show that what you have done has placed an additional burden on someone, and the only way to make that up is to contribute to them. Sometimes restitution means that our undue the thing that you did wrong. If you steal, then you return it; if you break something, then you replace it. However there are some things that you cannot undo.\n\nKnowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.\n\nIn these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.\n\nQuestion:I need to express regret for something I did, but I want to use a different word than 'sorry.' What are some alternative words I can use to express an apology?",

            "passage": "It’s important to be sincere and honest when you’re apologizing for something you’ve done. But does the plural “My apologies” carry more weight than the singular “My apology”? Both phrases refer to a feeling of regret, but only one of them actually means “I’m sorry” (even if you only sort of mean it). “My Apologies” Means “I’m Sorry”\nThe word apology comes from the Greek apologia, meaning “a speech of defense.” Even though apologies is technically the plural version of apology, that’s not how we use it in English. My apologies is an idiom that means “I feel regret” or “I’m sorry.” In this context, my apologies is short for the longer “Please accept my apologies,” which has a similar meaning to “I beg your pardon.”\n- My apologies for bumping into you. - I sent you the wrong directions? My apologies. I’ll send you the correct ones. You can also use my apologies as an idiomatic statement for regret. - Please give Harold my apologies; I won’t be able to attend the wedding. - I made my apologies to the host before leaving early from the party. When Do You Use “My Apologies”? Because my apologies is a more formal expression than “I’m sorry,” you typically use it when:\n- you’re trying to be polite in a social situation (“My apologies, I didn’t see you there.”)\n- you’re RSVPing “no” to an event (“My apologies, I won’t be able to attend.”)\n- you’re addressing a misunderstanding or mistake at work (“My apologies, let me send the attachment again.”)\nNotice that you can separate my apologies from the rest of the sentence with a comma when using it to mean “I’m sorry.”\n“My Apology” Means “That Time I Said I Was Sorry”\nWhen you say “my apology,” you’re referring to a time when you said you were sorry. The noun phrase is a literal description of someone’s statement of regret or remorse, not an idiom for “I’m sorry.”\n- In the letter, I expressed my apology for the unkind things I said. - The newspaper printed my apology in the editorial section. Unlike my apologies, my apology doesn’t just relate to social situations. You also can’t use my apology as a synonym for “I’m sorry.”\nYou express my apology for a specific thing you said or did; you express my apologies for breaking social rules. Is It “Please Accept My Apology” or “Please Accept My Apologies”? The apology vs. apologies debate gets a little tricky when you’re asking someone to accept it (or them). Both “Please accept my apology” and “Please accept my apologies” are correct — depending on the context. - Please accept my apology for breaking your lamp. (You’re apologizing for something specific.) - Please accept my apologies for being late. (You’re being polite.) You may also use “Please accept my apologies” when you’re issuing more than one apology. For example, if you’re apologizing for breaking the lamp, yelling at your friend, slamming their door, spreading rumors about them online, and crashing their car — yeah, you probably owe them more than one apology. But if it’s just one offense, “Please accept my apology” will do it. More Ways To Say “I’m Sorry”\nMy apologies and my apology aren’t the only statements that express remorse. If “I’m sorry” isn’t the right phrase, try:\n- Excuse me\n- Pardon me\n- Please forgive me\n- My bad\n- My mistake",

            "passage": "One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.",

            "passage": "I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares! We all have high maintenance people in our lives.",

            "passage": "‘I’m sorry.’ The two simple yet powerful words couples might have difficulty saying at the right time. As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.",

            "passage": "They're Not Just for Children\nWe learned them as children, but no mater your age these essential words are effortless to say and convey a wealth of meaning to others. They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.",

            "passage": "How To Apologize\nA look into apologies from a neurological intelligence perspective\nWhen I was a kid I did not understand apologies very well. One time at an art day camp I told someone that their artwork looked ugly. He was so upset that he snitched to the camp leader, who made me apologize. I said sorry, and the kid was still upset. They told me to \"Say it like I mean it\" whatever that meant, so I changed my voice to make it sound pitiful and regretful and said sorry again. They preferred the second apology to the first, even though I wasn't any more sorry the second time. I did not learn to apologize better from that exchange, but I did learn that people care a lot and can be very particular about how you apologize. They care because an apology has a purpose. I now know that apologies are supposed to initiate, or facilitate the healing of a broken relationship. If your apology doesn't do that, then others won't accept it. While other people have a very specific expectation of what your apology should look like, you might have different reasons for wanting to apologize. Usually people apologize after they realize that their actions affect themselves or after they realize how their actions affected others. For example, when I hurt the kid's feelings I could have apologized out of fear of the punishment the camp instructor might give me, or I could have apologized because I realized how much I had hurt the kid. The first motivation does not make for a good apology because people want to believe that you care about them. In addition to looking at good and bad apologies we will also be looking at the 5 different methods of apologizing. These methods were found by marriage councilor Gary Chapman. He calls them the languages of apology; they are: expressing regret, restitution, requesting forgiveness, not doing it again, and accepting responsibility. He found these different types of apologies by interviewing people, and asking them \"if you were to apologize to someone how would you do it? \", and \"if someone were to apologize to you how would you want them to do it?\" It turns out that these different types of apologies are rooted in the ethics of neurological intelligence. You can read more about these in my post titled Meta Ethics. As a quick recap the theory states that there are two systems of ethics. The first states that ethical behavior is motivated by preserving or enhancing your identity. This theory is where bad apologies come from. The second states that ethical behavior comes from building or preserving your relationships, this is where good apologies come from. Both systems of ethics have six different ethical principles which define them. The sixth relationship ethic states that you need to show people mercy; one way to do this is through apologizing for the ways that you failed the other ethics. Therefore the sixth ethic is not an apology method, but apologizing itself. Similarly the sixth identity ethic is not a method of making a poor apology, but instead the motivation for making a poor apology. Language 1: Don't Do it Again\nWhen you stop doing something that is wrong you are following the social contracts ethic. This ethic states that the only way to keep people from taking advantage of each other is to make mutually beneficial social contracts. When you stop doing harmful things you show that you are capable of creating and keeping social contracts again. The identity ethic that corresponds to this is the values ethic. It states that the things you believe are right are what is right. If you stop doing the things that you believe are wrong this might be good or bad, that depends on whether you were right or not. But it is not necessarily an apology. For it to be an apology it would have to actually be benefiting others with your change of behavior. Language 2: Restitution\nRestitution means that you try to correct the bad thing you have done. It comes from the common good ethic, which states that in order to reap the greatest benefit from group living you must contribute to the common good of society. When you make restitution you show that what you have done has placed an additional burden on someone, and the only way to make that up is to contribute to them. Sometimes restitution means that our undue the thing that you did wrong. If you steal, then you return it; if you break something, then you replace it. However there are some things that you cannot undo.",

            "passage": "Knowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

            "passage": "Thursday, January 15, 2009\nI got this sweet but very sad picture (above) from a friend... It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.",

            "passage": "In these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.",

    "text": "La Tomatina is a festival held in the Valencian town of Buñol, where the people who wish to participate, throw tomatoes at one another for the ultimate tomato fight. The festival takes place on the last Wednesday of every August and people love to get involved. There’s something about getting soaked in Tomato juice that seems to put a great big smile on everyone’s face. Dump trucks are brought to the scene and people get to dive in and start throwing tomatoes. All the action is followed by celebrations of food and drink and dance. Over 150,000 tomatoes are used every year which come from Extremadura, a less expensive tomato.\nAt 11:00am canons sound by exploding tomato-packed rockets at the people to commence the event. Over 30,000 people show up for the tomato throw down. In 2013, city officials introduced an entry fee and limited the number of participants, citing concerns over safety. At 12:00p.m. the canons sound again signaling that the tomato throwing has come to its end.\nTomato Throwing Pointers:\n- Participants must use goggles and gloves.\n- All tomatoes must be crushed before bring thrown to avoid risk of injury.\n- No other projectiles are allowed to be thrown.\nThe whole idea of a Tomato throwing festival wasn’t an idea at all but an angry play that took place back in August of 1945, when a group of young people went into the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young group decided to cheer with a musician but through the excitement, caused one person to fall off of a float. This created a storm from the fallen participant getting up from the ground and hitting everyone in his path, causing an apparent uproar in the crowd.\nA nearby vegetable stand stood where there were tomatoes and people automatically began pelting one another with them. This was the start of what has become known as La Tomatina. There were years after the first tomato was thrown, where locals battled with authorities and were briefly sent to jail, until the town finally got permission to throw tomatoes at one another without law enforcement intervening. Authorities finally allowed tomato throwing one day a year, making the event official.",

    "answer": "La Tomatina, the famous tomato fight festival celebrated annually in the Spanish town of Buñol, began quite unexpectedly. The origin of the festival dates back to the 1940s, when a group of young men from the town decided to join a local parade honoring the town's patron saint, San Luis Bertrán.\n\nFeeling mischievous, these young men, who were also known to be pranksters, decided to spoil the mood of the parade. They obtained a large quantity of tomatoes and started hurling them at each other and at the parade participants. The tomato fight quickly escalated, turning the entire square into a messy battleground of red pulp.\n\nThe playful incident quickly turned into a tradition, and the following year, on the same day, a similar event occurred. This time, even more people joined in, and the tomato fight became an annual event. Over the years, it has grown into the massive festival it is today, attracting thousands of participants from around the world who gather to engage in the world's largest tomato fight.\n\nSince then, La Tomatina has become an iconic event, celebrated every last Wednesday of August, where participants are encouraged to throw tomatoes at each other, turning the streets of Buñol into a vibrant, tomato-soaked playground. Despite the chaos, it's an event marked by good-natured fun and camaraderie among its participants.",

Valencia, on the east coast of Spain, is a sunny Mediterranean city famous for its long sandy beaches and delicious oranges. Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes. The curious thing, however, is that the small town’s notoriety does not stem from the quality of its tomatoes but rather their interesting custom of “bathing” in it. Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes. The tomatoes are specially grown for the festival and are said to not be of food grade quality. When the last Wednesday of August arrives, shopkeepers and other business owners with establishments near the main square cover their windows and doors in preparation for the messy tomato event. The next step in La Tomatina festival is the arrival of the large trucks that slowly make their way up the cobblestone streets of Buñol filled with squishy ripe tomatoes on route to the town square where masses of people are awaiting the official start of the festival. However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water. The result is actually a pristine shine to the cobblestone streets which are disinfected and thoroughly cleansed due to the acidity of the tomato sauce. The Buñol Tomatina festival is an event worth witnessing and participating in at least once in your lifetime. However, we recommend that you plan ahead, the small town only offers so much accommodation and the hotels in all the surrounding areas quickly fill up as the event draws near.

The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

Held annually in Bunol (roughly a 30-minute drive from Valencia), this saucy celebration offers participants just one glorious hour of red, pulpy, juicy, squishy and sticky fun. How to paint a town in tomato juice\nAt about 11am on August 27, 2014 (and on the last Wednesday of every August), La Tomatina explodes into Bunol with thousands of sticky visitors and flying tomatoes, and by the end of the frenzied hour, you can hardly tell the people and produce apart. It starts with the tradition where one of the punters has to climb a greasy pole and fetch a ham from the top – as soon as the ham is down, the pulpy carnage can begin. According to urban legend, it all started in the mid-1940s when a group of men wanted to partake in a local parade. Somewhat miffed, they protested by stealing tomatoes from a local stall and using them as weapons. A year later, the same thing happened, yet it wasn’t until the late 50s that the event became official. These days, Bunol’s 9,000 residents are overwhelmed by roughly 30,000 people surging in to the city. Pro tip: Book your accommodation well in advance or expect to stay in Valencia, as Bunol doesn’t have the capacity for such an influx. In fact, the festival used to attract as many as 50,000 people, but since 2013 it has been a ticketed event, capping the numbers to just 20,000 lucky tomato throwers. Tens of thousands of revellers surge through the tiny streets of Bunol, squashing, volleying and dodging approximately 117,934kg (that’s almost 2,000kg a minute!) of overripe tomatoes, according to the Huffington Post. Fire trucks come in afterwards to clean up the pooling mess on the streets, while it’s up to the soggy tomato throwers to clean off best they can either at the Bunol River, or back at their accommodation. Shopkeepers cover their storefronts in an attempt to protect their businesses from the ubiquitous tomato goo, the whole city celebrates for the week with music, parades, dancing and fireworks, and Bunol imports several trucks (or about 100 tonnes) of ripe tomatoes from Extremadura. While it may look like red chaos, there are a handful of rather important rules to keep in mind – as well as some expert advice. 1. You can’t rip shirts\n2. You have to squish the tomatoes prior to throwing them\n3. You can only throw tomatoes\n4. You must stop at the sound of the second cannon\n5. You are strongly – strongly – advised to wear goggles and gloves\n6. Wear closed shoes that you don’t care too much about – thongs will only slip off, and your clothes don’t stand much of a chance of recovering from the battle\n7. Bring waterproof covers for your cameras and phones, and keep keys in plastic bags under your clothes. The less you can bring with you the better, and just make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in case those pesky tomatoes do find their way into somewhere they shouldn’t be. Check out the options available from Virgin Travel Insurance to see if they suit your needs.

La Vijanera is often a colourful masquerade celebrated on the 1st Sunday with the year from the small city of Silió, Cantabria.

Every “zarramaco” has a particular purpose and collectively they tour the city of Silió hunting and banishing evil spirits. Just after studying the “coplas” – a humorous critique recalling the gatherings on the prior 12 months – comes the symbolic looking and killing on the bear.

Although Spain is widely known by Flamenco and bullfights, this country has several festivals and celebrations and most towns have their own in addition to the national ones. The majority of festivals in Spain are religious in origin, but, these days, this religious component of every celebration is usually secondary.|\nBelow you'll see a list with the most impressive festivals or \"fiestas\" in Spain:\nCarnival in Spain\nDuring the Carnival celebrations in February there are several impressive festivities in all Spain, specially in Tenerife and Cádiz. In fact, carnival in the Canary Islands and Cádiz are the bests Carnival celebrations in the world, after Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Trinidad. In those cities, colourful processions are organised and participants wear extravagant costumes. Generally, in many cities of Spain, people dress up and go out, and dance all night long. The Carnival celebrations end on Ash Wednesday with the traditional burial of the Sardine, this event marks the beginning of Lent. Seville April Fair Andalucia\nSeville's April Fair (La Feria de Abril) is a huge annual event which takes place in Seville - Andalucía - two weeks after Easter. During this festival you have the opportunity to see the typical flamenco dress, which almost all women wear. Also you will hear the songs of the \"cantaores\" (flamenco singers) and enjoy the movements of the \"bailaoras\" (dancers). San Fermin Running of the Bulls, Pamplona\nThe festival of San Fermin is by far the best known event taking place in Pamplona. Every year from July 7th-14th thousands pack into Pamplona to start Spain's most famous bull-running fiesta to honour Navarre capital's patron saint, San Fermin. The bull run is the most well known act of the Sanfermines and the reason why so many strangers want to come to Pamplona during these celebrations. The bull running consists of running along certain stretches of the streets which have been previously walled off, and the aim of which is to take six bulls from the Santo Domingo corrals to the Bull Ring. La Tomatina in Buñol, Valencia. Tomato Festival\nThe \"Tomatina\" is the world's biggest tomato fight and takes place at Bunyol near Valencia. On the last Wednesday of August this charming town erupts into a fiery blaze of tomato-hurling. This fight takes place between 11am and 1pm on that day. Every year around 30,00 people descend on the Spanish town of Bunyol to throw more than 240,000 pounds of tomatoes at each other. Fallas Festival in Valencia\nLas Fallas is, without doubt, one of the most unique and crazy festivals in Spain. The Fallas takes place every March in Valencia to celebrate the feast of San José, the patron saint of carpenters. The focus of the fiesta is the creation and destruction of \"ninots\" (huge cardboard statues made of wood and plaster) that are placed at over 350 key intersections and parks around the city. In fact, in all the town you will see these \"ninots\" which will be burned at the last day of the festival -March 19th- in a festival of fire, fireworks and organized mayhem. Festes de la Merce in Barcelona\nLa Merce, Barcelona's biggest annual festival, takes place on 24th September and lasts for around 3 days. This is a festival held in honour of Mare de Deu de la Merce, the Patron Saint of Barcelona. During this festival, fire-breathing dragons, costumed devils, human pyramids, Sardana dance groups, orchestras, DJs and big-name bands converge on Barcelona. San Isidro in Madrid\nSan Isidro is the patron saint of the peasants and is also the patron saint of Madrid. Madrid's main annual festival includes nine days of celebrations as well as the start of the capital's bullfighting season.

La Tomatina lasts for exactly one hour from the cannon shot, once the Ham has been won from the 'Soap Pole'. It ends with another cannon shot. The Spanish rarely continue after the cannon. Niether should you. The Organisers tell you to squash tomatoes prior to hurling them, They can really hurt if they hit you, whole, in the face. T-shirts must never be knotted and thrown, a wet t-shirt with a knot in can do serious damage. Ladies, do wear a bather under your t-shirt or top, you will more than likely lose your top during the battle...\nNever take valuables or passports into the fray - there is a serious amount of pickpocketing at La Tomatina each year - make sure, if you are on a coach, that they will look after your belongings while you battle. (if you are on a thisisvalencia.com coach - its all part of the service)Or leave your things for a few euros with one of the villagers offering the service on the way into the village. Oh, and bring a change of clothes, and if you are on our thisisvalencia.com tour, bring your swimmers - we swim and chill in a lovely spot after lunch. RULES AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ORGANISERS OF LA TOMATINA\nThese are virtually verbatim from their copy, we've changed a bit of spelling and grammar, but 'tip for enjoyment' number four is classic,\nso we left it unchanged. (anything in italics are our notes and additions)\nRULES & TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT FROM BUÑOL CITY HALL\nThe City Hall of Buñol has prepared a list of rules which will ensure that the Tomatina remains a celebration. These simple rules of civic responsibility and cohabitation are important for the festival to develop as usual, without any problem:\n· You must not bring bottles or other type of objects which could cause an accident. · You must not break(knot) or throw T-shirts. · The tomatos must be squashed before throwing them, to avoid hurting people. · You must be careful of any lorry. · When you hear the second shot, you must stop throwing tomatos. TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT\nDo not wear flip-flops, wear old sports shoes\nDo not wear clothes that you want to wear again in the future, it ishighly likely they will be ruined. - don't forget we give you a free tee-shirt, and we'll have extras for sale on the day\nGoggles are very practical, because the tomatos cause itchiness in the eyes. (Later, your skin will be very smooth due to the tomatoes.) - - don't forget we give you a free pair of goggles on the day! Enjoy it the most. It is great to be able to do something as nonsense as throwing tomatoes to anyone moving for an hour. You can relieve all your tightness. We should celebrate it more often. If you want to take pictures, you need an underwater waterproof camera. - We always carry a stock of very reasonably priced waterproof disposable cameras on the day - order in advance narer the day\nDo not bring a video camera. - unless it is waterproof. Never, and we mean never, climb on a gate, window, wall, etc. to be able to watch the battle, you will became the target of 40,000 people.

Valencia, on the east coast of Spain, is a sunny Mediterranean city famous for its long sandy beaches and delicious oranges. Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes. The curious thing, however, is that the small town’s notoriety does not stem from the quality of its tomatoes but rather their interesting custom of “bathing” in it. Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes. The tomatoes are specially grown for the festival and are said to not be of food grade quality. When the last Wednesday of August arrives, shopkeepers and other business owners with establishments near the main square cover their windows and doors in preparation for the messy tomato event. The next step in La Tomatina festival is the arrival of the large trucks that slowly make their way up the cobblestone streets of Buñol filled with squishy ripe tomatoes on route to the town square where masses of people are awaiting the official start of the festival. However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water. The result is actually a pristine shine to the cobblestone streets which are disinfected and thoroughly cleansed due to the acidity of the tomato sauce. The Buñol Tomatina festival is an event worth witnessing and participating in at least once in your lifetime. However, we recommend that you plan ahead, the small town only offers so much accommodation and the hotels in all the surrounding areas quickly fill up as the event draws near.

            "passage": "HISTORYThere are plenty of theories on how the legend of La Tomatina came about. The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

            "passage": "La Tomatina is one of very few places – outside of American rom-coms – where public food fighting is not only allowed, but highly encouraged. Held annually in Bunol (roughly a 30-minute drive from Valencia), this saucy celebration offers participants just one glorious hour of red, pulpy, juicy, squishy and sticky fun. How to paint a town in tomato juice\nAt about 11am on August 27, 2014 (and on the last Wednesday of every August), La Tomatina explodes into Bunol with thousands of sticky visitors and flying tomatoes, and by the end of the frenzied hour, you can hardly tell the people and produce apart. It starts with the tradition where one of the punters has to climb a greasy pole and fetch a ham from the top – as soon as the ham is down, the pulpy carnage can begin. According to urban legend, it all started in the mid-1940s when a group of men wanted to partake in a local parade. Somewhat miffed, they protested by stealing tomatoes from a local stall and using them as weapons. A year later, the same thing happened, yet it wasn’t until the late 50s that the event became official. These days, Bunol’s 9,000 residents are overwhelmed by roughly 30,000 people surging in to the city. Pro tip: Book your accommodation well in advance or expect to stay in Valencia, as Bunol doesn’t have the capacity for such an influx. In fact, the festival used to attract as many as 50,000 people, but since 2013 it has been a ticketed event, capping the numbers to just 20,000 lucky tomato throwers. Tens of thousands of revellers surge through the tiny streets of Bunol, squashing, volleying and dodging approximately 117,934kg (that’s almost 2,000kg a minute!) of overripe tomatoes, according to the Huffington Post. Fire trucks come in afterwards to clean up the pooling mess on the streets, while it’s up to the soggy tomato throwers to clean off best they can either at the Bunol River, or back at their accommodation. Shopkeepers cover their storefronts in an attempt to protect their businesses from the ubiquitous tomato goo, the whole city celebrates for the week with music, parades, dancing and fireworks, and Bunol imports several trucks (or about 100 tonnes) of ripe tomatoes from Extremadura. While it may look like red chaos, there are a handful of rather important rules to keep in mind – as well as some expert advice. 1. You can’t rip shirts\n2. You have to squish the tomatoes prior to throwing them\n3. You can only throw tomatoes\n4. You must stop at the sound of the second cannon\n5. You are strongly – strongly – advised to wear goggles and gloves\n6. Wear closed shoes that you don’t care too much about – thongs will only slip off, and your clothes don’t stand much of a chance of recovering from the battle\n7. Bring waterproof covers for your cameras and phones, and keep keys in plastic bags under your clothes. The less you can bring with you the better, and just make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in case those pesky tomatoes do find their way into somewhere they shouldn’t be. Check out the options available from Virgin Travel Insurance to see if they suit your needs. Do think you’re a natural born food fighter?",

            "passage": "The festivals and celebrations in Spain are full of life. Although Spain is widely known by Flamenco and bullfights, this country has several festivals and celebrations and most towns have their own in addition to the national ones. The majority of festivals in Spain are religious in origin, but, these days, this religious component of every celebration is usually secondary.|\nBelow you'll see a list with the most impressive festivals or \"fiestas\" in Spain:\nCarnival in Spain\nDuring the Carnival celebrations in February there are several impressive festivities in all Spain, specially in Tenerife and Cádiz. In fact, carnival in the Canary Islands and Cádiz are the bests Carnival celebrations in the world, after Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Trinidad. In those cities, colourful processions are organised and participants wear extravagant costumes. Generally, in many cities of Spain, people dress up and go out, and dance all night long. The Carnival celebrations end on Ash Wednesday with the traditional burial of the Sardine, this event marks the beginning of Lent. Seville April Fair Andalucia\nSeville's April Fair (La Feria de Abril) is a huge annual event which takes place in Seville - Andalucía - two weeks after Easter. During this festival you have the opportunity to see the typical flamenco dress, which almost all women wear. Also you will hear the songs of the \"cantaores\" (flamenco singers) and enjoy the movements of the \"bailaoras\" (dancers). San Fermin Running of the Bulls, Pamplona\nThe festival of San Fermin is by far the best known event taking place in Pamplona. Every year from July 7th-14th thousands pack into Pamplona to start Spain's most famous bull-running fiesta to honour Navarre capital's patron saint, San Fermin. The bull run is the most well known act of the Sanfermines and the reason why so many strangers want to come to Pamplona during these celebrations. The bull running consists of running along certain stretches of the streets which have been previously walled off, and the aim of which is to take six bulls from the Santo Domingo corrals to the Bull Ring. La Tomatina in Buñol, Valencia. Tomato Festival\nThe \"Tomatina\" is the world's biggest tomato fight and takes place at Bunyol near Valencia. On the last Wednesday of August this charming town erupts into a fiery blaze of tomato-hurling. This fight takes place between 11am and 1pm on that day. Every year around 30,00 people descend on the Spanish town of Bunyol to throw more than 240,000 pounds of tomatoes at each other. Fallas Festival in Valencia\nLas Fallas is, without doubt, one of the most unique and crazy festivals in Spain. The Fallas takes place every March in Valencia to celebrate the feast of San José, the patron saint of carpenters. The focus of the fiesta is the creation and destruction of \"ninots\" (huge cardboard statues made of wood and plaster) that are placed at over 350 key intersections and parks around the city. In fact, in all the town you will see these \"ninots\" which will be burned at the last day of the festival -March 19th- in a festival of fire, fireworks and organized mayhem. Festes de la Merce in Barcelona\nLa Merce, Barcelona's biggest annual festival, takes place on 24th September and lasts for around 3 days. This is a festival held in honour of Mare de Deu de la Merce, the Patron Saint of Barcelona. During this festival, fire-breathing dragons, costumed devils, human pyramids, Sardana dance groups, orchestras, DJs and big-name bands converge on Barcelona. San Isidro in Madrid\nSan Isidro is the patron saint of the peasants and is also the patron saint of Madrid. Madrid's main annual festival includes nine days of celebrations as well as the start of the capital's bullfighting season. During these days of celebration many cultural events are offered to the people: contests of \"chotis\" (Madrid's traditional dance), concerts of folk music, craftsmanship fairs, etc.",

            "passage": "RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\nIt has to be said that the Spanish may sound like lawless funsters who disobey all the rules but the reason that La Tomatina and other fiestas in Spain are fun and relatively accident free is that they do, in fact, respect the rules. La Tomatina lasts for exactly one hour from the cannon shot, once the Ham has been won from the 'Soap Pole'. It ends with another cannon shot. The Spanish rarely continue after the cannon. Niether should you. The Organisers tell you to squash tomatoes prior to hurling them, They can really hurt if they hit you, whole, in the face. T-shirts must never be knotted and thrown, a wet t-shirt with a knot in can do serious damage. Ladies, do wear a bather under your t-shirt or top, you will more than likely lose your top during the battle...\nNever take valuables or passports into the fray - there is a serious amount of pickpocketing at La Tomatina each year - make sure, if you are on a coach, that they will look after your belongings while you battle. (if you are on a thisisvalencia.com coach - its all part of the service)Or leave your things for a few euros with one of the villagers offering the service on the way into the village. Oh, and bring a change of clothes, and if you are on our thisisvalencia.com tour, bring your swimmers - we swim and chill in a lovely spot after lunch. RULES AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ORGANISERS OF LA TOMATINA\nThese are virtually verbatim from their copy, we've changed a bit of spelling and grammar, but 'tip for enjoyment' number four is classic,\nso we left it unchanged. (anything in italics are our notes and additions)\nRULES & TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT FROM BUÑOL CITY HALL\nThe City Hall of Buñol has prepared a list of rules which will ensure that the Tomatina remains a celebration. These simple rules of civic responsibility and cohabitation are important for the festival to develop as usual, without any problem:\n· You must not bring bottles or other type of objects which could cause an accident. · You must not break(knot) or throw T-shirts. · The tomatos must be squashed before throwing them, to avoid hurting people. · You must be careful of any lorry. · When you hear the second shot, you must stop throwing tomatos. TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT\nDo not wear flip-flops, wear old sports shoes\nDo not wear clothes that you want to wear again in the future, it ishighly likely they will be ruined. - don't forget we give you a free tee-shirt, and we'll have extras for sale on the day\nGoggles are very practical, because the tomatos cause itchiness in the eyes. (Later, your skin will be very smooth due to the tomatoes.) - - don't forget we give you a free pair of goggles on the day! Enjoy it the most. It is great to be able to do something as nonsense as throwing tomatoes to anyone moving for an hour. You can relieve all your tightness. We should celebrate it more often. If you want to take pictures, you need an underwater waterproof camera. - We always carry a stock of very reasonably priced waterproof disposable cameras on the day - order in advance narer the day\nDo not bring a video camera. - unless it is waterproof. Never, and we mean never, climb on a gate, window, wall, etc. to be able to watch the battle, you will became the target of 40,000 people. Don't miss the ‘soap-post’ a pole rubbed in soap with a ham leg hanging at the top. If you can reach the top, the ham leg is yours.",

The perfumery!”: Documenting science-related cultural learning pathways across contexts and timescales. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51(3), 260–285. doi:10.1002\/tea.21134\nCurrent science education reforms emphasize the ways in which students’ scientific practices, such as experimenting, collecting data, and interpreting results, develop over time. Bricker and Bell suggest that practices develop not only over time, but also across multiple settings and opportunities. Their study shows how, over several years, one youth’s identification with science was shaped by many everyday moments, social configurations, and collaborators. Maltese, A., Melki, C., & Weibke, H. (2014). The nature of experiences responsible for the generation and maintenance of interest in STEM. Science Education, 98(6), 937–962. doi:10.1002\/sce.21132\nResearchers Maltese, Melki, and Wiebke investigated when lasting interest in STEM is sparked and how it is maintained by comparing the remembrances of adults who did and did not persist in STEM. Both groups said that they became interested in STEM early, usually by Grade 6. Those who persisted in STEM were more likely than those who did not to say that they had always been interested in STEM. Parents and teachers were early influences for those who stayed in STEM fields. Van Schijndel, T. J. P., Franse, R. K., & Raijmakers, M. E. J. (2010). The Exploratory Behavior Scale: Assessing young visitors’ hands-on behavior in science museums. Science Education, 94, 794–809. The authors of this paper were interested in knowing how parents can support exploratory behaviors of their preschool-aged children at museum exhibits. They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

The field of informal science education has embraced “making” and design activities as a powerful approach to engaging learners. This chapter by Blikstein finds that in order to create disruptive spaces where students can learn STEM, design and build inventive projects, educators . This paper provides theoretical background and concrete cases that illuminate program design and implementation issues related to making. Alexander, J. M., Johnson, K. E., & Kelley, K. (2012).

She concluded that the benefits of visiting a science museum are “much more than science,” including spending quality time together as a family, interacting with others, learning about local culture and history, learning from each other, and, of course, learning science.

This study looks at how characteristics of parent-child dyads, in combination with exhibit qualities, contribute to their interactions in a science center.\n\nReliability coefficients for each subscale were determined using statistical methods better suited to ordinal data analysis. The SPSS Categories procedure CATPCA (a nonlinear Categorical Principal Components Analysis) uses optimal scaling to statistically transform ordinal data into a quantitative numerical variable (Meulman, Van der Kooij, & Heiser, 2004). CATPCA provides an ordinal alpha reliability measure, and the reliability coefficient calculated is for the transformed variables (IBM Support, 2013). To compare and confirm reliability statistics, both Cronbach’s Alpha and CATPCA ordinal alpha analyses were conducted (using SPSS, Version 22.0), and the results are shown in Table 4. Alpha reliability coefficients normally range between 0 and 1. “A reliability coefficient of 0.70 or higher is considered ‘acceptable’ in most social science research situations” (UCLA, Institute for Digital Research and Education, 2017, An Example, para. 2; see also George & Mallery, 2003; Kline, 1999). It is not surprising that the values for ordinal alpha were higher (because ordinal data is being analyzed) than those for Cronbach’s alpha, which treats Likert scale data as interval data. Mean values of responses by category. Although participants’ answers to individual survey items are on an ordinal (Likert) scale, the answers to a group of items in a category can be regarded as close to normally distributed interval data. Therefore, these data were analyzed using mean values. A comparison of the means of each subgroup by category is shown in Table 4 and is also displayed graphically in Figure 1. |Category||Number of items||AEEs||CTTs||Cronbach's Alpha||CATPCA Ordinal Alpha|\nFigure 1. Mean scores for all items on each subscale by subgroup. The highest mean scores for both subgroups were obtained in the Resources category. The lowest mean score for CTTs was in the Human Values category, and the lowest mean scores for AEEs were in the Systems and Modeling categories (tied). In summary, salient findings included:\n- Descriptive statistics including median ratings, standard deviations, and the Interquartile Range (IQR) for each item;\n- A ranked analysis of the engineering and technology concepts and skills perceived to be most important for the general education of high school students by whole-group median rating;\n- An identification of items for which differences between subgroups were statistically significant;\n- A list of concepts and skills that experts agree are highly important for high school students to attain as part of their fundamental education that are not presently addressed by the STL; and\n- Internal consistency reliability measures of the subscales. A limitation of the present research related to the selection of the expert panelists: there was a considerable imbalance between more experienced (presumably older) and less experience (presumably younger) panelists. Thus, perspectives of younger educators who might have reflected more contemporary views of the importance of certain ideas and skills may not have been adequately considered. Therefore, it is recommended that in selecting panelists for future studies, targeted efforts should be made to recruit younger panelists to determine if their perceptions about the importance of knowledge and skills related to contemporary technologies differ significantly from their more experienced, presumably older, colleagues. Because engineering and technology education are receiving greater attention as components of STEM education, support for the establishment of PreK–12 ETE programs in the United States has been rapidly growing. Although university level academic engineering educators are an ideal professional constituency to ally with and support secondary school ETE programs, prior to this study, it was uncertain whether they held similar perceptions about the fundamental knowledge and skills that high school graduates need for life in a technological world to the classroom technology teachers who develop curriculum and deliver secondary school ETE instruction. We have examined the alignment of the two constituencies’ perceptions about the importance of key concepts and skills that all high school students in the United States should learn as part of their fundamental education. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a greater degree of concordance than there are perceptual differences between the two constituencies.\n\nA national need exists to effectively engage women and people categorized as minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and career paths. Given the minimal existence of standards and accreditation boards for engineering design and holistic engineering practice in K–12 contexts, we must better understand how said engineering design and holistic engineering practice affects the learning and identity formation of K–12 students. Here, 50 rising 9th–12th grade girls are exposed to either a socio-ethics enhanced engineering curriculum or a standard engineering curriculum through a week-long STEM summer camp. Qualitative methods are used to conduct a thematic analysis on the engineering language used by students in each curriculum group. Significant differences in language and attitudes towards engineering and the practice of STEM subjects is observed through the incorporation of ethics and humanities into a standard model engineering curriculum. The study presented in this paper demonstrates that students have a tendency towards describing scientific ideas through abstract terms, while a group who participated in the social science integrated camp tended to describe scientific ideas using social-emotional terms. Lastly, students who participated in the camp with integrated social sciences displayed an expanded view and sense of responsibility for the society for which their science is developed to serve. These results could have implications on how STEM subjects are communicated to attract and sustain student interest.

Research indicates that engineering and technology integration in K-12 improve students’ content understanding and skill development, understanding of interactions among the STEM disciplines, and interest in STEM careers. Many in-service STEM teachers have limited experience and\/or educational background in engineering and technology. These teachers have limited confidence to incorporate engineering and technology in their classroom. At a professional development (PD) workshop, that is part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded engineering research project, teachers from different school districts were invited to learn building automation and additive manufacturing at a university campus in summer 2017. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of students on the STEM pathway. This work reports the findings of a study that explored the effectiveness of a teacher PD workshop implemented in the first year of the project. In the PD workshop teachers engaged in authentic engineering design activities using 3D printers and the internet of things technologies. In this two-week program, teachers were trained to use computer-aided design tools, additive manufacturing processes, and how to integrate sensors into various devices. University faculty and students, who administered the workshop, illustrated how to effectively incorporate these technologies and engineering design principles into their classrooms. The main question posed was: to what extent do the teachers’ participation in the professional development activities affect their confidence and efficacy toward STEM and perception of engineering and teaching? To answer this question, authors employed a pre- and post-test survey research design was employed; data were collected from the participants before and after the PD workshop activities. The Design, Engineering and Technology (DET) Survey and Teacher Efficacy and Attitudes toward STEM Survey (T-STEM) were administered to participants. DET is a five-point Likert scale with 40 items. This instrument focuses on capturing the participants’ views and familiarity with DET concepts. The T_STEM survey is a 5 point Likert scale with 36 items. The T_STEM survey measures participants’ confidence and efficacy towards STEM fields, 21st century learning, and other constructs. Quantitative data and statistical analyses of pre and post workshop data are presented. Cevik, E., & Johnson, M., & Yalvac, B., & Whitfield, J. G., & Kuttolamadom, M., & Porter, J. R., & Morgan, J.

This study utilized mixed methods to analyze how changes in middle school students’ affective characteristics might be linked to their future career decision-making, following participation in an integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics summer camp. As part of the summer camp, rising sixth- through eighth-grade students attended a weeklong learning experience based on a specific engineering context. Each grade level cohort participated with their same grade peers in a 36-hour, 6-day event focused on sparking their interest in engineering careers and developing their content knowledge in select science and mathematics content areas. Pre-post testing was conducted with 65 students of diverse backgrounds in grades six through eight to measure their self-reported engineering-related self-efficacy, knowledge of engineering careers, and motivation to pursue future engineering classes and careers. In addition, interviews were conducted to examine any changes in middle school camp participants’ affective characteristics of motivation, self-efficacy, and self-determination.

STEM toys' six principles and characteristics are quality, price, age, type, design, and size. Children need the company of their parents and friends, play games with friends, and learn different concepts of new things around the world. High-quality toys provide a longer life and ensure safety and reliability. From the perspective of quality, the following points can be considered:\n- Material quality : Choose durable materials, such as aluminum alloy, ABS plastic, etc., to ensure that the toy is more durable. - Manufacturing process : Ensuring that an experienced manufacturer produces the toy ensures the quality of the toy. - Safety : Make sure the toy meets safety standards and is certified safe. - Brand reputation : Choosing toys produced by a brand with a good reputation can ensure the quality and reliability of the toy. When buying STEAM toys, parents need to strike a balance between price and quality. The following points may be considered:\n- Cost-effective ratio : Make sure that the toy is cost-effective, that the price is within a reasonable price, and that it provides enough education for the child's Meaning and play value. - Deals : Look out for specials or promotions when shopping for STEM toys, and you may be able to get a better price. - Long-term use : Ensure that the toy is possible for long-term use, and avoid buying expensive or cheap toys that can only be played with for a while. When choosing STEM toys, the child's age is an important consideration. The reason is that children of different age groups need different levels of challenges and education. The following points can be considered:\n- Age : Choose age-appropriate toys and ensure they can understand and use them. - Skill level : meet the child's current skill level, and avoid being too difficult or too easy. - Learning stage : In line with the child's current educational stage, for example, simple building blocks are assembled for young children, and programming robots are relatively complicated for middle school students. - Children's interests : Choose something that suits your child's preferences, such as mechanical assembly for children who love to assemble things. As explained earlier about the types or themes of STEM toys, STEM\/STEAM subjects can be considered when choosing the right toys for children. If your child is curious and likes to research, consider science-themed toys, such as chemistry experiment kits, microscopes, and programming robots. If you like artistic creation, you can consider art-themed toys, mainly to inspire imagination and creativity. The appearance of the toy will also affect the child's attention and concentration on the toy, so whether the color and design are beautiful or not is also of certain importance:\n- Appearance : Choose attractive and aesthetically pleasing bright colors that attract children's attention and interest. - Construction : Construction meets safety and reliability standards and is easy to use and assemble. - Function : It is practical and educational and can meet the needs of children for learning and playing. The size of STEAM\/STEM toys should also be considered as one of the factors:\n- Space Constraints : Able to be used and stored within an appropriate space in the home. - Mobility : Choose toys that are easy to move, so they can be carried to other places for use. - Toy size : Choose a toy of the appropriate size. If the toy is too large, there may not be enough space in the home;\n- The toys are too small. Be careful if children accidentally swallow it and cause accidents, so pay special attention. STEM Questions and Answers\nWhat does STEM education mean?

To enhance recruitment into the sciences and to decrease attrition from the sciences, it is essential to understand why students, especially women and minorities, tend not to pursue science. Research has shown that attitude toward science correlated with achievement, selection of courses in high school and college and pursuing science as a career.^ The purpose of this study was to examine a structural equation model which estimated and tested the relationships among the latent variables general aptitude, science self-efficacy, science attribution and attitudes toward science for a nationwide sample of 411 high school students. Multi-group models were analyzed to determine if the structural model was invariant across gender, ethnicity and ability.^ Results showed that Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA) (Fraser, 1977) and the Science Self-efficacy Questionnaire (Smist, 1993) provided reliable and valid measures of their respective constructs. They also were found to operate consistently across gender and ethnic groups. With respect to science attitude differences between males and females, males showed more positive attitudes toward careers in science and were more open minded than females, but females had more positive attitudes about the normality of scientists.^ Much research has been done concerning the underrepresentation of women and minorities in professional occupations resulting from their negative attitudes toward science and low self-efficacy beliefs concerning performance in science. In this study, males showed significantly higher self-efficacy in two areas of science: the laboratory and chemistry. However, there were no gender differences in the other two areas measured, namely, biology and physics.^ The results from this study also showed that although students in AP science classes may be considering a career in science, they don't necessarily like science classes. They do enjoy performing experiments and have a high degree of confidence in dealing with laboratory tasks. For females and minorities, especially, college educators need to work at fostering their self-efficacy and improving their attitudes in order to keep them interested in the sciences. ^\nSmist, Julianne Marie, \"Science self-efficacy, attributions and attitudes toward science among high school students\" (1996).

Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier. Posted Mar 30, 2022",

Bricker and Bell suggest that practices develop not only over time, but also across multiple settings and opportunities. Their study shows how, over several years, one youth’s identification with science was shaped by many everyday moments, social configurations, and collaborators. Maltese, A., Melki, C., & Weibke, H.

The authors of this paper were interested in knowing how parents can support exploratory behaviors of their preschool-aged children at museum exhibits. They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

The SPSS Categories procedure CATPCA (a nonlinear Categorical Principal Components Analysis) uses optimal scaling to statistically transform ordinal data into a quantitative numerical variable (Meulman, Van der Kooij, & Heiser, 2004). CATPCA provides an ordinal alpha reliability measure, and the reliability coefficient calculated is for the transformed variables (IBM Support, 2013). To compare and confirm reliability statistics, both Cronbach’s Alpha and CATPCA ordinal alpha analyses were conducted (using SPSS, Version 22.0), and the results are shown in Table 4. Alpha reliability coefficients normally range between 0 and 1. “A reliability coefficient of 0.70 or higher is considered ‘acceptable’ in most social science research situations” (UCLA, Institute for Digital Research and Education, 2017, An Example, para. 2; see also George & Mallery, 2003; Kline, 1999). It is not surprising that the values for ordinal alpha were higher (because ordinal data is being analyzed) than those for Cronbach’s alpha, which treats Likert scale data as interval data. Mean values of responses by category. Although participants’ answers to individual survey items are on an ordinal (Likert) scale, the answers to a group of items in a category can be regarded as close to normally distributed interval data. Therefore, these data were analyzed using mean values. A comparison of the means of each subgroup by category is shown in Table 4 and is also displayed graphically in Figure 1. |Category||Number of items||AEEs||CTTs||Cronbach's Alpha||CATPCA Ordinal Alpha|\nFigure 1. Mean scores for all items on each subscale by subgroup. The highest mean scores for both subgroups were obtained in the Resources category. The lowest mean score for CTTs was in the Human Values category, and the lowest mean scores for AEEs were in the Systems and Modeling categories (tied). In summary, salient findings included:\n- Descriptive statistics including median ratings, standard deviations, and the Interquartile Range (IQR) for each item;\n- A ranked analysis of the engineering and technology concepts and skills perceived to be most important for the general education of high school students by whole-group median rating;\n- An identification of items for which differences between subgroups were statistically significant;\n- A list of concepts and skills that experts agree are highly important for high school students to attain as part of their fundamental education that are not presently addressed by the STL; and\n- Internal consistency reliability measures of the subscales. A limitation of the present research related to the selection of the expert panelists: there was a considerable imbalance between more experienced (presumably older) and less experience (presumably younger) panelists. Thus, perspectives of younger educators who might have reflected more contemporary views of the importance of certain ideas and skills may not have been adequately considered. Therefore, it is recommended that in selecting panelists for future studies, targeted efforts should be made to recruit younger panelists to determine if their perceptions about the importance of knowledge and skills related to contemporary technologies differ significantly from their more experienced, presumably older, colleagues. Because engineering and technology education are receiving greater attention as components of STEM education, support for the establishment of PreK–12 ETE programs in the United States has been rapidly growing. Although university level academic engineering educators are an ideal professional constituency to ally with and support secondary school ETE programs, prior to this study, it was uncertain whether they held similar perceptions about the fundamental knowledge and skills that high school graduates need for life in a technological world to the classroom technology teachers who develop curriculum and deliver secondary school ETE instruction. We have examined the alignment of the two constituencies’ perceptions about the importance of key concepts and skills that all high school students in the United States should learn as part of their fundamental education. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a greater degree of concordance than there are perceptual differences between the two constituencies.",

Given the minimal existence of standards and accreditation boards for engineering design and holistic engineering practice in K–12 contexts, we must better understand how said engineering design and holistic engineering practice affects the learning and identity formation of K–12 students. Here, 50 rising 9th–12th grade girls are exposed to either a socio-ethics enhanced engineering curriculum or a standard engineering curriculum through a week-long STEM summer camp. Qualitative methods are used to conduct a thematic analysis on the engineering language used by students in each curriculum group. Significant differences in language and attitudes towards engineering and the practice of STEM subjects is observed through the incorporation of ethics and humanities into a standard model engineering curriculum. The study presented in this paper demonstrates that students have a tendency towards describing scientific ideas through abstract terms, while a group who participated in the social science integrated camp tended to describe scientific ideas using social-emotional terms. Lastly, students who participated in the camp with integrated social sciences displayed an expanded view and sense of responsibility for the society for which their science is developed to serve.

            "passage": "Salt Lake City, Utah\nJune 23, 2018\nJune 23, 2018\nJuly 27, 2018\nThere is a growing concern in the US about the lack of student interest and aptitude in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. Research indicates that engineering and technology integration in K-12 improve students’ content understanding and skill development, understanding of interactions among the STEM disciplines, and interest in STEM careers. Many in-service STEM teachers have limited experience and\/or educational background in engineering and technology. These teachers have limited confidence to incorporate engineering and technology in their classroom. At a professional development (PD) workshop, that is part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded engineering research project, teachers from different school districts were invited to learn building automation and additive manufacturing at a university campus in summer 2017. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of students on the STEM pathway. This work reports the findings of a study that explored the effectiveness of a teacher PD workshop implemented in the first year of the project. In the PD workshop teachers engaged in authentic engineering design activities using 3D printers and the internet of things technologies. In this two-week program, teachers were trained to use computer-aided design tools, additive manufacturing processes, and how to integrate sensors into various devices. University faculty and students, who administered the workshop, illustrated how to effectively incorporate these technologies and engineering design principles into their classrooms. The main question posed was: to what extent do the teachers’ participation in the professional development activities affect their confidence and efficacy toward STEM and perception of engineering and teaching? To answer this question, authors employed a pre- and post-test survey research design was employed; data were collected from the participants before and after the PD workshop activities. The Design, Engineering and Technology (DET) Survey and Teacher Efficacy and Attitudes toward STEM Survey (T-STEM) were administered to participants. DET is a five-point Likert scale with 40 items. This instrument focuses on capturing the participants’ views and familiarity with DET concepts. The T_STEM survey is a 5 point Likert scale with 36 items. The T_STEM survey measures participants’ confidence and efficacy towards STEM fields, 21st century learning, and other constructs. Quantitative data and statistical analyses of pre and post workshop data are presented. Cevik, E., & Johnson, M., & Yalvac, B., & Whitfield, J. G., & Kuttolamadom, M., & Porter, J. R., & Morgan, J.

This study utilized mixed methods to analyze how changes in middle school students’ affective characteristics might be linked to their future career decision-making, following participation in an integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics summer camp. As part of the summer camp, rising sixth- through eighth-grade students attended a weeklong learning experience based on a specific engineering context. Each grade level cohort participated with their same grade peers in a 36-hour, 6-day event focused on sparking their interest in engineering careers and developing their content knowledge in select science and mathematics content areas. Pre-post testing was conducted with 65 students of diverse backgrounds in grades six through eight to measure their self-reported engineering-related self-efficacy, knowledge of engineering careers, and motivation to pursue future engineering classes and careers. In addition, interviews were conducted to examine any changes in middle school camp participants’ affective characteristics of motivation, self-efficacy, and self-determination.

            "passage": "The six principles of STEM toys selections: how to choose? STEM toys' six principles and characteristics are quality, price, age, type, design, and size. Children need the company of their parents and friends, play games with friends, and learn different concepts of new things around the world. High-quality toys provide a longer life and ensure safety and reliability. From the perspective of quality, the following points can be considered:\n- Material quality : Choose durable materials, such as aluminum alloy, ABS plastic, etc., to ensure that the toy is more durable. - Manufacturing process : Ensuring that an experienced manufacturer produces the toy ensures the quality of the toy. - Safety : Make sure the toy meets safety standards and is certified safe. - Brand reputation : Choosing toys produced by a brand with a good reputation can ensure the quality and reliability of the toy. When buying STEAM toys, parents need to strike a balance between price and quality. The following points may be considered:\n- Cost-effective ratio : Make sure that the toy is cost-effective, that the price is within a reasonable price, and that it provides enough education for the child's Meaning and play value. - Deals : Look out for specials or promotions when shopping for STEM toys, and you may be able to get a better price. - Long-term use : Ensure that the toy is possible for long-term use, and avoid buying expensive or cheap toys that can only be played with for a while. When choosing STEM toys, the child's age is an important consideration. The reason is that children of different age groups need different levels of challenges and education. The following points can be considered:\n- Age : Choose age-appropriate toys and ensure they can understand and use them. - Skill level : meet the child's current skill level, and avoid being too difficult or too easy. - Learning stage : In line with the child's current educational stage, for example, simple building blocks are assembled for young children, and programming robots are relatively complicated for middle school students. - Children's interests : Choose something that suits your child's preferences, such as mechanical assembly for children who love to assemble things. As explained earlier about the types or themes of STEM toys, STEM\/STEAM subjects can be considered when choosing the right toys for children. If your child is curious and likes to research, consider science-themed toys, such as chemistry experiment kits, microscopes, and programming robots. If you like artistic creation, you can consider art-themed toys, mainly to inspire imagination and creativity. The appearance of the toy will also affect the child's attention and concentration on the toy, so whether the color and design are beautiful or not is also of certain importance:\n- Appearance : Choose attractive and aesthetically pleasing bright colors that attract children's attention and interest. - Construction : Construction meets safety and reliability standards and is easy to use and assemble. - Function : It is practical and educational and can meet the needs of children for learning and playing. The size of STEAM\/STEM toys should also be considered as one of the factors:\n- Space Constraints : Able to be used and stored within an appropriate space in the home. - Mobility : Choose toys that are easy to move, so they can be carried to other places for use. - Toy size : Choose a toy of the appropriate size. If the toy is too large, there may not be enough space in the home;\n- The toys are too small. Be careful if children accidentally swallow it and cause accidents, so pay special attention. STEM Questions and Answers\nWhat does STEM education mean? STEM education is an educational model that deepens children's concepts of mathematics, physics, and chemistry and improves children's ability to solve problems through the cooperation of different sciences. STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. What is STEAM education? STEAM education refers to the education method based on STEM education and adding artistic elements to inspire children's creativity and allow children to develop in all aspects. What are STEM toys? STEM toys are toys based on STEM education. Children's learning efficiency in STEM courses can be improved through interaction and games.",

To enhance recruitment into the sciences and to decrease attrition from the sciences, it is essential to understand why students, especially women and minorities, tend not to pursue science. Research has shown that attitude toward science correlated with achievement, selection of courses in high school and college and pursuing science as a career.^ The purpose of this study was to examine a structural equation model which estimated and tested the relationships among the latent variables general aptitude, science self-efficacy, science attribution and attitudes toward science for a nationwide sample of 411 high school students. Multi-group models were analyzed to determine if the structural model was invariant across gender, ethnicity and ability.^ Results showed that Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA) (Fraser, 1977) and the Science Self-efficacy Questionnaire (Smist, 1993) provided reliable and valid measures of their respective constructs. They also were found to operate consistently across gender and ethnic groups. With respect to science attitude differences between males and females, males showed more positive attitudes toward careers in science and were more open minded than females, but females had more positive attitudes about the normality of scientists.^ Much research has been done concerning the underrepresentation of women and minorities in professional occupations resulting from their negative attitudes toward science and low self-efficacy beliefs concerning performance in science. In this study, males showed significantly higher self-efficacy in two areas of science: the laboratory and chemistry. However, there were no gender differences in the other two areas measured, namely, biology and physics.^ The results from this study also showed that although students in AP science classes may be considering a career in science, they don't necessarily like science classes. They do enjoy performing experiments and have a high degree of confidence in dealing with laboratory tasks. For females and minorities, especially, college educators need to work at fostering their self-efficacy and improving their attitudes in order to keep them interested in the sciences. ^\nSmist, Julianne Marie, \"Science self-efficacy, attributions and attitudes toward science among high school students\" (1996).

Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.\n\nThis is certainly not due to any BUS superiority, as this would apply in the reading case as well. We may thus safely assume that it is due to a firmware restriction. Probably the SCSI models are based on a higher quality lasers! (Might it be the case that during production the best apparatus is probably used on the SCSI models, and those passing the quality tests next are used for the ATAPI models?) We also tested the access times of the drives\nusing same media capacities as previously. The software that was used in this case was the Ziff Davis\n?Media?s WinBench 99 v.1.2?. The ATAPI model gave the same access time results\nas the SCSI drive. The best performance (36.1 msec) comes from the lower capacity\ndisk (230MB). The drive accessed the 540MB and 640MB disks at an average of 37\nmilliseconds throughout the media?s surface. The highest access time was given\nwhen the tested media had a capacity of 1.3GB. Fujitsu Magneto-optical (MO) drives seem to be an attractive\nproposal for the user who needs an alternative, to the\nplain old compact disk, removable storage medium format. Serving multiple functionalities, the Fujitsu MO drives can\nbe used as a secondary Hard Disk (1.3GB) of a lower however capacity, a descent backup solution for\nmoderately sized user data, or a high capacity floppy disc for everyday\noffice-to-home file transfers. With installation and usage simplicity, even\nnovice users who are asking for an economical and reliable solution can easily\nadopt MO drives. Buffer underruns and drive-to-media incompatibilities from\nwhich frequently suffer other formats, such as the compact disks, are unknown\nto MO drives and media. On the other hand, with cartridges that are impervious to\ndust, moisture, and shock, Fujitsu MO disks are extremely rugged and highly\ntolerant of the problems that plague regular magnetic media. It is important to take into account when making your own assessment that each MO disk comes with a lifetime warranty. The power point of Fujitsu MO drives is the low random\naccess times. Officially Fujitsu claims that MO drives can randomly access a MO\ndisk at an average of 23msec. Our tests showed a access times in the area of 35msec. As for the transfer rates achieved, they are lower\nthan those an optical CD-R drive can give today. However, the MO technology will not disappoint the candidate\nMC 3130AP or MC 3130SS buyer. Fujitsu is already developing the 2.3GB MO line\nof drives, while it has promised the even larger capacities of 5.2 and\n9.1GB per disk. The reader might also read the appendices to this review by clicking the relevant links below and to the right. 6. Appendix I. Fixed Storage versus Removable storage\nThe evolution of optical data storage\nToday?s hard disk devices support gigantic capacities,\nallowing the storage of large amounts of data with high availability and\nsafety. When we talk about storage, we usually have in mind the hard disk\ndrives. Fixed hard disk drives offer almost everything a home\nor office user needs. All except an easy method of transferring data between\ndifferent computer systems. Furthermore, they are not immune to magnetic field radiation and by no\nmeans can they be considered a permanent storage solution. The read signal\ndeteriorates in a few year?s period. But what about our everyday desktop needs for removable,\nreliable and economical storage? The (not too much) unexpected explosion in CD recordable\/rewritable\ndrives sales over the period of the last few years, have prompted optical media\ninto a leading position in the removable data storage category. Optical and magneto-optical drives now offer the same\nalternative solutions once offered by the floppy discs, now an area occupied by\nRemovable media technology is currently lagging\nfixed-storage achievements in both raw performance and price cost per available\ndisk space offered. For example, compare the 40MB hard disks embodying the\nearly 1990?s PCs with the 15GB per disk standard capacity of a typical system\ntoday. A 30-fold increase in available storage, with a marginal decrease in\nIn contrast, a DVD-ROM drive typically equipping a modern\nPC, offers just an 8-fold available disk space increase, at about the same\namount of money. In the case of MO media technology, and during the same as\nbefore time-frame, we went from a 3.5\", 128MB disk available to consumers during the\nfirst MO device shipments of Fujitsu in early 90?s, to 1.3GB disks capable drives today.\n\nResearchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it. The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates.

This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nWhen co-author Zhaoming Zhu, Gauthier's postdoctoral research associate, encoded information onto one of these beams, the data could be imprinted on these newly created phonons and retained for 12 billionths of a second, long enough to be transferred back to light again by shining a third laser through the fiber. \"When thinking about how to store light in optical fibers,\" Zhu says, \"we realized that we can convert optical information to acoustic vibration, something that hasn't been done before.\" The researchers are seeking ways to create longer storage times and reduce the peak power of the laser beam needed for retaining and reading out the information, a process that will take years before a commercial version of the technology is available. \"There is still a great need for developing new strategies for optimizing the flow of information over the Internet,\" says Robert Boyd, a professor of optics and physics at the Institute of Optics and a research co-author. \"If two data packets arrive at a switch at the same time, you need to store one until the other packet clears the switch, maybe 100 nanoseconds later. Our technique is aimed at … building buffers for high-speed telecommunications.\" During the first phase of the project—which is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office slow-light program—Zhu says he learned that pulses could be stored and read out at a later time. The second phase was the actual experiment in which data pulses were stored (as acoustic waves in an optical fiber) and retrieved after a certain period of time. \"We really want to demonstrate that methods for storing optical information are much broader than people thought,\" Gauthier says. \"In the current telecommunication systems, you turn the optical signal into an electronic signal and store it in RAM. The optical data pulses are then regenerated by using the electrical signals to turn on and off an auxiliary laser source. But this process generates heat. The faster this is done, the more heat is generated.\" For this to work in the real world, the scientists say the communication fibers must be made of a material that provides an acoustic time frame long enough to allow the information to move from optical to sound, then return to optical. One option, Gauthier says, is to work with a new type of glass made from a chalcogenide, which has good semiconductor properties and contains one or more elements from the periodic table's chalcogenide group, also known as the \"oxygen family,\" which includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Another option that researchers are exploring is to run the laser beams through a hollow optical fiber filled with gas (such as xenon), which would allow them to use a less powerful laser to induce longer lasting sound waves in the gas. This could potentially create a sound wave 50 times longer and allow the lasers used to be 100 times less powerful—and less energy intensive—thereby delivering more data more quickly at a lower cost. New Video VoIP Software, Webcams End That Pixelated Feeling\nSkype and Logitech team up to deliver video voice over Internet protocol calls that look more like TV than home videos\nThanks to the rapid-fire growth of broadband network connectivity, video voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services now give callers around the world the ability to gab away for no more than the cost of their monthly Internet service provider fee. Until now, though, the video capabilities have been little more than a novelty that tempts callers with grainy images of their friends and family that lack the ability to capture their movement with any fluidity. But that could change as early as next month when Luxembourg–based Skype, a division of online auctioneer eBay, is set to unveil the latest version of its software, which is tuned to work with a new lineup of \"high-quality video\" Web cameras from Fremont, Calif.–based Logitech. The companies gave a preview Tuesday of what's to come at a New York City press conference, where they demonstrated their software and hardware working together to produce video VoIP that looks more like watching TV than grainy home movies. This is no small feat, as the laundry list of requirements indicates. What do you need to take advantage of this latest offering?\n\nBy Zeeya Merali of Nature magazine\nA one-way system for light rays could allow optical computer chips to overtake their standard electronic counterparts. The new device should eventually help to improve the speed of data processing and ease Internet traffic. Optical, or photonic, chips use light rather than an electrical current to carry information. State-of-the-art optical chips already transfer data at rates of around 10 gigabits per second--more than 100 times faster than the best electronic chips, says Liang Feng, an electrical engineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"That's the noticeable difference between a Google search you carry out today taking a few seconds to load, and a search being done in the future in less than a blink,\" he says. For more than a decade, engineers have been working to make commercially viable optical chips, but to do so they need to come up with the optical equivalent of the electronic diode. This allows current to pass in only one direction, preventing back-scattered current from interfering with other components and the forward signal. Such 'optical diodes' have been created in the past, but they either use materials that are incompatible with silicon or rely on magnetic fields to block backward light1. \"Unfortunately, you can't stick something magnetic near your computer or it will disrupt it,\" says Feng. Guiding the ray\nFeng and his colleagues have now created a silicon waveguide--a slab with a rectangular cross-section measuring 200 nanometers thick and 800 nanometers wide--that channels light in only one direction. Standard waveguides allow waves to pass through in both directions, but Feng's team realized that adding extra layers of materials with different reflective and refractive properties, at specific points along the tunnel, could break this symmetry. \"It has been known for a long time that adding layers to the sides of waveguides can affect forward and backward motion, but it was tricky to calculate the particular structure that would manipulate the light just as we needed,\" says Feng. Using calculations and computer simulations, the team hit on the right materials and pattern for a waveguide that would allow a forward-moving light wave to progress symmetrically--so that its peaks and troughs remain parallel--while disrupting the backward wave in such a way that its successive peaks and troughs deviate from the parallel. The solution involved adding a number of sinusoidal-shaped bumps of silicon, 40 nanometers thick, along one side of the waveguide, and similar bumps, made of a layer of germanium sandwiched with chrome, on the other side. The team monitored the passage of light through the waveguide using a near-field scanning optical microscope and confirmed that a narrow beam of light successfully passes through the waveguide forwards, but that the wave's symmetry breaks down when traveling backwards2. The next step is to incorporate the waveguide into a device that filters out the asymmetric light. \"We hope to have this completed soon,\" says Feng. Nasser Peyghambarian, an optical scientist at the University of Arizona in Tuscon, says that the work is an \"important step for building optical chips\". But he adds that it may be another 15 years before a full range of optical components, including laser sources and optical amplifiers, are ready to be integrated together: \"Only then can we talk about using photonic chips in real commercial products.\" This article is reproduced with permission from the magazine Nature.

Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD\n1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3. These discs have the capacity to hold up to 3.9 terabyte (TB) of information, which is approximately 6,000 times the capacity of a CDROM, 830 times the capacity of a DVD, 160 times the capacity of single-layer Blu-ray-Discs, and about 48 times the capacity of standard computer hard drives. 4. The HVD also has a transfer rate of 1 gigabit\/s. 5. While reading a page the entire page of data can be retrieved quickly and at one time .\n\nIn an article published in the trade journal Optics Express, IBM has announced that it is developing technology that may replace current electronic chips in future computers. Rather than using electrical connections, which are prone to overheating and EMI problems, the company is planning to produce processors that use light to carry out calculations. Using micro-miniaturised Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators\n, IBM hopes to produce chips which are capable of running up to one hundred times faster than is currently possible with traditional CPUs, and some three times faster than the gains promised by recent research into 3D processors\nThe best news is yet to come: the new chips will do all this and consume somewhere in the region of a tenth\nthe power of current CPUs. Less power means less heat, which in turn means you can cram more horsepower into a smaller area without worrying about things melting down. You'll have a bit of a wait on your hands for the new light-based superchip, however: the head honcho of the project, Will Green, is predicting commercial availability “in the timeframe of 10 to 15 years. ” Initial batches of the chip have been earmarked by, surprise surprise, the high-tech branch of the Department of Defense - DARPA\n- who is partially funding the research project. To allow Will to blow his own trumpet for a moment: “Just like fibre optic networks have enabled the rapid expansion of the Internet by enabling users to exchange huge amounts of data from anywhere in the world, IBM's technology is bringing similar capabilities to the computer chip. While the research is clearly aimed at customers who need big-budget supercomputers, it'll be interesting to see how and when it trickles down to the retail level.

            "passage": "European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.",

            "passage": "Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.",

EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt.

The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.",

This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.",

Our technique is aimed at … building buffers for high-speed telecommunications.\" During the first phase of the project—which is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office slow-light program—Zhu says he learned that pulses could be stored and read out at a later time. The second phase was the actual experiment in which data pulses were stored (as acoustic waves in an optical fiber) and retrieved after a certain period of time. \"We really want to demonstrate that methods for storing optical information are much broader than people thought,\" Gauthier says. \"In the current telecommunication systems, you turn the optical signal into an electronic signal and store it in RAM. The optical data pulses are then regenerated by using the electrical signals to turn on and off an auxiliary laser source. But this process generates heat. The faster this is done, the more heat is generated.\" For this to work in the real world, the scientists say the communication fibers must be made of a material that provides an acoustic time frame long enough to allow the information to move from optical to sound, then return to optical. One option, Gauthier says, is to work with a new type of glass made from a chalcogenide, which has good semiconductor properties and contains one or more elements from the periodic table's chalcogenide group, also known as the \"oxygen family,\" which includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Another option that researchers are exploring is to run the laser beams through a hollow optical fiber filled with gas (such as xenon), which would allow them to use a less powerful laser to induce longer lasting sound waves in the gas. This could potentially create a sound wave 50 times longer and allow the lasers used to be 100 times less powerful—and less energy intensive—thereby delivering more data more quickly at a lower cost.

Until now, though, the video capabilities have been little more than a novelty that tempts callers with grainy images of their friends and family that lack the ability to capture their movement with any fluidity. But that could change as early as next month when Luxembourg–based Skype, a division of online auctioneer eBay, is set to unveil the latest version of its software, which is tuned to work with a new lineup of \"high-quality video\" Web cameras from Fremont, Calif.–based Logitech. The companies gave a preview Tuesday of what's to come at a New York City press conference, where they demonstrated their software and hardware working together to produce video VoIP that looks more like watching TV than grainy home movies.

            "passage": "By Zeeya Merali of Nature magazine\nA one-way system for light rays could allow optical computer chips to overtake their standard electronic counterparts. The new device should eventually help to improve the speed of data processing and ease Internet traffic. Optical, or photonic, chips use light rather than an electrical current to carry information. State-of-the-art optical chips already transfer data at rates of around 10 gigabits per second--more than 100 times faster than the best electronic chips, says Liang Feng, an electrical engineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"That's the noticeable difference between a Google search you carry out today taking a few seconds to load, and a search being done in the future in less than a blink,\" he says. For more than a decade, engineers have been working to make commercially viable optical chips, but to do so they need to come up with the optical equivalent of the electronic diode. This allows current to pass in only one direction, preventing back-scattered current from interfering with other components and the forward signal. Such 'optical diodes' have been created in the past, but they either use materials that are incompatible with silicon or rely on magnetic fields to block backward light1. \"Unfortunately, you can't stick something magnetic near your computer or it will disrupt it,\" says Feng. Guiding the ray\nFeng and his colleagues have now created a silicon waveguide--a slab with a rectangular cross-section measuring 200 nanometers thick and 800 nanometers wide--that channels light in only one direction. Standard waveguides allow waves to pass through in both directions, but Feng's team realized that adding extra layers of materials with different reflective and refractive properties, at specific points along the tunnel, could break this symmetry. \"It has been known for a long time that adding layers to the sides of waveguides can affect forward and backward motion, but it was tricky to calculate the particular structure that would manipulate the light just as we needed,\" says Feng. Using calculations and computer simulations, the team hit on the right materials and pattern for a waveguide that would allow a forward-moving light wave to progress symmetrically--so that its peaks and troughs remain parallel--while disrupting the backward wave in such a way that its successive peaks and troughs deviate from the parallel. The solution involved adding a number of sinusoidal-shaped bumps of silicon, 40 nanometers thick, along one side of the waveguide, and similar bumps, made of a layer of germanium sandwiched with chrome, on the other side. The team monitored the passage of light through the waveguide using a near-field scanning optical microscope and confirmed that a narrow beam of light successfully passes through the waveguide forwards, but that the wave's symmetry breaks down when traveling backwards2. The next step is to incorporate the waveguide into a device that filters out the asymmetric light. \"We hope to have this completed soon,\" says Feng. Nasser Peyghambarian, an optical scientist at the University of Arizona in Tuscon, says that the work is an \"important step for building optical chips\". But he adds that it may be another 15 years before a full range of optical components, including laser sources and optical amplifiers, are ready to be integrated together: \"Only then can we talk about using photonic chips in real commercial products.\" This article is reproduced with permission from the magazine Nature.

That seems increasingly elusive in our overnetworked society, where every buzz and rumor is instantly blogged and tweeted, and it is not contemplation we desire but an odd sort of distraction, distraction masquerading as being in the know. In such a landscape, knowledge can’t help but fall prey to illusion, albeit an illusion that is deeply seductive, with its promise that speed can lead us to more illumination, that it is more important to react than to think deeply, that something must be attached to every bit of time.

Photograph: Amoris-Causa\nView original post\nMontaigne portrait – Dali 1947\nMeditation is a rich and powerful method of study for anyone who knows how to examine his mind, and to employ it vigorously. I would rather shape my soul than furnish it. There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne\n“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large. They find themselves born into a certain place in society, and they accept what each day brings forth, without any effort of thought beyond what the immediate present requires…they seek the satisfaction of the needs of the moment, without much forethought, and without considering that by sufficient effort the whole condition of their lives could be changed…It is only a few rare and exceptional men who have that kind of love toward mankind at large that makes them unable to endure patiently the general mass of evil and suffering, regardless of any relation it may have to their own lives.

It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\n“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself. I’ve worked hard at being the hero of my own life. But every time I checked the register of displaced persons, I was still on it. I didn’t know how to belong. Longing? Yes. Belonging?

Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: \"123 wise phrases to reflect on life\"\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.\n\nLeaving the Question Blank\nSo when I first learned I was going to speak at graduation today and after taking a selfie with my transcript, I thought to myself “Sweet! You must be the first international, the first Bulgarian, or at least the first ‘Ivan’ to get to this point.” You can imagine my horror, then, when I found out that just in the last 10 years or so there were at least three international students who gave the Valedictorian speech, one of them was a Bulgarian, and, to top it all off, he was named “Ivan” as well. I felt just a little less special on the inside and pondered for a couple of minutes the deeply existential question of why “Ivan” is such a popular name in Bulgaria. This little glimpse into my mental life is probably enough to convince you that I, like most Williams students, am an active participant in the business of comparing myself to other people. We, the people of Williams, might not speak about grades with our friends, but please do take a moment and try to recollect whether you’ve been in a situation before where a conversation about everyone’s schedule was instantly turned into a competition on who has the busiest workload, the most extracurricular activities, or the highest honors. I certainly have. As smart and ambitious people, it is unsurprising that we seek metrics to compare our performance to that of other smart and ambitious people. Yet it seems to me that there is something deeply anxious about this proclivity, first, because part of us really wants to score higher than others on most metrics, and, second, because it can be really frikkin’ hard to figure out why do we want what these metrics measure. Without knowing this, we are in danger of endowing these metrics with a life on their own, of constantly seeking the reassurance of the high score, while incessantly battling the primal fear that others are better than us and being unable to tell why this is such a frightening prospect. Now, having posed the hard question of what is it that your heart really craves, as a philosophy major, I will do what philosophers do best – leave the question blank and then hope to get credit for the whole deal. I cannot help but think that this is one of those unanswerable questions because the answer changes as we change, grow, and encounter new perspectives, ideas, and experiences. What gave us meaning in the past might not give us meaning anymore, and it is difficult to predict what will give us meaning in the future. For example, I really did think that “Ivan” was the best name to have in Bulgaria. It seems to me, however, that the true response to this question is not to have an answer ready when it is posed to us, to hide behind predetermined metrics and neat little labels and hope that they somehow bestow meaning on our existence, but to embrace its complexity and the continual reevaluation of who we are as an essential element of our nature. Part of the value of a Williams education is that we have to change the metrics we think in and reshuffle the available labels in our minds when we are exposed to a variety of academic fields and when we interact with individuals that are not at all minded like us, but that are equally talented and intellectually curious. For this reason alone, I think it is a good thing that we do not speak about our grades because it is easy to compare grades, but it is hard to figure out what these grades mean to and about each one of us. Fellow classmates, I am fairly confident that the vast majority of the facts and concepts we have learned in class here will be forgotten in the exciting and diverse lives we are likely to lead. We have learned these concepts as answers to paper prompts, problem set items, and exam questions. Yet I cannot help but think that the most important skill we have attained at this place is not to answer these questions, but to question the answers we give or have been given. Because rather than immutable like the theorems of mathematics, the models of economics, and the laws of nature, the answers to the questions that are most important to us right here, right now, and at any time and place in our lives are likely to be as mercurial and capricious as Williamstown weather. The power to leave the answer to these questions blank is a special power that everyone gathered here has. Because of this alone, I hope that we will all be able to lead happy and fulfilling lives.\n\nGiven that both propaganda and advertising are increasingly present in our lives, and given that many times they offer arguments that seem rational even though they are really a bunch of political slogans, philosophy helps us estimate to what extent certain statements start from rationality or not. Detect these intellectual deceptions before they take root in our minds based on stereotypes and preconceived ideas, it is very useful to develop a proper perspective of things, one that does not depend on ideologies.\n\n- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning.

Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.\n\nWhy Study Philosophy?Page address: https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/philosophy\/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill. Philosophy in the Job Market\n- Chicago Business Journal - The Sword of Damocles: The Value of Philosophy to a Business Leader\n- The Wall Street Journal - Why I Was Wrong About Liberal Arts Majors\n- The New York Times - In a New Generation of College Students, Many Opt for the Life Examined\n- Huffington Post - The Unexpected Way Philosophy Majors Are Changing The World Of Business\n- The Atlantic Monthly - The Management Myth\n- Why Study Philosophy - Philosophy: What can it do for you?\n\nThough it was, admittedly, many years ago, I recall vividly the very first seminar I attended as a Freshman in college. This was a real seminar, where the students were expected to carry the ball; not a “seminar” where students sat and listened to an “expert” talk at them. We had been reading Homer’s Illiad and about midway through the two-hour seminar I made what I thought was a salient point about the reasons Hector dragged Achilles’ body three times around Troy after killing him. Almost immediately another student looked at me and asked “why?” I was stunned. I thought the point was obvious. Why should I have to give reasons for what otherwise was as obvious as the proverbial nose on your face? My blogging buddy Keith recently mentioned that his daughter, a college Freshman, was praised by her professor for writing a paper in his class in which she took exception to what the author had said. She was praised because she was one of the few students who disagreed with what she was reading and being told. She had asked herself the question: “why?” She was praised because she was one of the few who had done so. Little kids ask the question “why? repeatedly out of their natural curiosity. Their fathers and mothers answer until they are finally forced to say “because I said so.” Perhaps this stops the question, but not for long. The child soon begins again: “Why Daddy?” “Why Mommy?” Eventually they stop asking the question. And the schools rarely encourage students to ask the question, so the kids stop asking questions and increasingly believe what they are told — even by chronic liars who couldn’t tell a fact if it came up and bit them in the butt. Why is this? I never stopped asking this question after that first seminar. In fact, we had four years of seminars twice a week in which students were constantly asking the “why question.” It led me to philosophy where I have continued to ask the question ever since. Indeed, I wrote an ethics book that centers on the question “why?” in an attempt to encourage the students to ask that question at every turn — just as they did as little children. The “why question” requires that reasons be given for claims being made. One doesn’t simply accept as fact the things people say or write. One demands evidence and argument support — even in ethics, where we too frequently dismiss complex issues with the lazy response “who’s to say?”\nComplex issues demand thought and the refusal to stop asking the why question until we have reached a point where the answer seems to be staring us in the face. When the weight of the evidence seems to have provided the answer, it is time to stop (subject to further review). But we never know when we have reached that point until we have examined the issue from both sides and have eliminated all possibilities. It is an exhausting process, but it is what makes us think when we might otherwise allow our mental faculties to sleep and simply accept as true a claim that is blatantly false. You know, the kinds of things that certain politicians say all the time. There has never been a better time than the present to ask the “why question,” and we should not stop until it seems pointless to ask it any more. And that point cannot be reached without persistence and determination to know what is true and separate the true from the false, the absurd from the plausible, the reasonable from the unreasonable. We will never know where that point is until we have reached it. And it is best to have someone asking it with us, because two heads really are better than one — as I learned lo those many years ago in that seminar.\n\nPreparation for a Variety of Careers\nPhilosophy majors develop important and widely marketable skills, like the ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems. This means that getting a degree in philosophy provides excellent preparation for a variety of careers. Get Into Graduate School\nStudying philosophy can also help you get into graduate school. Philosophy majors excel on standardized tests like the GRE, GMAT, and LSAT. They rank first among all majors on the verbal and the analytical section of the GRE. Philosophy majors also tend to do better than just about any other major on the LSAT. With a mean score of just over 157, they are second only to physics majors. When it comes to the GMAT, philosophy majors rank in the top five of all majors, and they consistently have higher scores than business majors (including management, finance, accounting, and marketing majors). Philosophy majors get high-paying jobs too. PayScale Inc.’s current list of the Best Undergrad College Degrees By Salary lists the starting and mid-career salaries (15.5 years after graduation) for fifty different majors. Philosophy ranks sixteenth on their list when it comes to mid-career median salaries. At $81,200, philosophy majors stand to make $9,100 more than business majors at this stage in their career! Philosophy is Fascinating! Probably the best reason to study philosophy is that it’s one of the most stimulating and interesting fields. Philosophers try to answer questions like the following. What is knowledge and how is it different from mere belief or opinion? What sorts of things are most valuable and how should I live my life? Does God exist? Do we really have free will? How should society be organized and what sort of system of government is best?\n\n“I don’t think it’s any worse or better now than it was last year or the year before or 20 years ago,” he said. Ultimately, the most difficult tasks that students face is figuring out which direction they’d like to take their lives. “The economy is maybe slightly worse than it was,” he continued, “but you still have to face those hard choices.”\nTo Kingwell, the value of an undergraduate degree is the same now as it has always been. “It’s about training your mind and yourself,” he argued, “It means that you are going to be able to do all kinds of things.”\nKingwell is well aware of the fact that most students in his introductory level course may not take another philosophy course in their lives. But to him, there is great power in the notion of learning for learning’s sake. “The point is to expose them to the most interesting arguments that have been made about what [we’re] doing here,” he said. It truly irks Kingwell when people question the validity of an undergraduate degree, especially one in philosophy. “Are you trying to tell me that the time I spent thinking about the world and my place in it wasn’t worthwhile?” he retorted, “That doesn’t make sense to me.”\nAnd for those who think that philosophy is impractical, Kingwell is not one to reckon with: “It makes you think more clearly about yourself and the world. It makes you a better citizen, ultimately, and maybe even a better person,” he countered, “And there is nothing of practical value that you could rate higher than those things, in my opinion.”\n\nThe profession of philosophy, largely under the leadership of the American Philosophical Association, has taken steps which, together with a pattern of a significant number of faculty approaching retirement, have gradually moved the market toward equilibrium between supply and demand of PhDs. Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy \"pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.\n\nQuestion:What makes philosophy valuable even though it doesn't give us definite answers?\n",

Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: \"123 wise phrases to reflect on life\"\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.",

            "passage": "Leaving the Question Blank\nSo when I first learned I was going to speak at graduation today and after taking a selfie with my transcript, I thought to myself “Sweet! You must be the first international, the first Bulgarian, or at least the first ‘Ivan’ to get to this point.” You can imagine my horror, then, when I found out that just in the last 10 years or so there were at least three international students who gave the Valedictorian speech, one of them was a Bulgarian, and, to top it all off, he was named “Ivan” as well. I felt just a little less special on the inside and pondered for a couple of minutes the deeply existential question of why “Ivan” is such a popular name in Bulgaria. This little glimpse into my mental life is probably enough to convince you that I, like most Williams students, am an active participant in the business of comparing myself to other people. We, the people of Williams, might not speak about grades with our friends, but please do take a moment and try to recollect whether you’ve been in a situation before where a conversation about everyone’s schedule was instantly turned into a competition on who has the busiest workload, the most extracurricular activities, or the highest honors. I certainly have. As smart and ambitious people, it is unsurprising that we seek metrics to compare our performance to that of other smart and ambitious people. Yet it seems to me that there is something deeply anxious about this proclivity, first, because part of us really wants to score higher than others on most metrics, and, second, because it can be really frikkin’ hard to figure out why do we want what these metrics measure. Without knowing this, we are in danger of endowing these metrics with a life on their own, of constantly seeking the reassurance of the high score, while incessantly battling the primal fear that others are better than us and being unable to tell why this is such a frightening prospect. Now, having posed the hard question of what is it that your heart really craves, as a philosophy major, I will do what philosophers do best – leave the question blank and then hope to get credit for the whole deal. I cannot help but think that this is one of those unanswerable questions because the answer changes as we change, grow, and encounter new perspectives, ideas, and experiences. What gave us meaning in the past might not give us meaning anymore, and it is difficult to predict what will give us meaning in the future. For example, I really did think that “Ivan” was the best name to have in Bulgaria. It seems to me, however, that the true response to this question is not to have an answer ready when it is posed to us, to hide behind predetermined metrics and neat little labels and hope that they somehow bestow meaning on our existence, but to embrace its complexity and the continual reevaluation of who we are as an essential element of our nature. Part of the value of a Williams education is that we have to change the metrics we think in and reshuffle the available labels in our minds when we are exposed to a variety of academic fields and when we interact with individuals that are not at all minded like us, but that are equally talented and intellectually curious. For this reason alone, I think it is a good thing that we do not speak about our grades because it is easy to compare grades, but it is hard to figure out what these grades mean to and about each one of us.

It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.",

            "passage": "Why Study Philosophy?Page address: https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/philosophy\/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill.

            "passage": "Though it was, admittedly, many years ago, I recall vividly the very first seminar I attended as a Freshman in college. This was a real seminar, where the students were expected to carry the ball; not a “seminar” where students sat and listened to an “expert” talk at them. We had been reading Homer’s Illiad and about midway through the two-hour seminar I made what I thought was a salient point about the reasons Hector dragged Achilles’ body three times around Troy after killing him. Almost immediately another student looked at me and asked “why?” I was stunned. I thought the point was obvious. Why should I have to give reasons for what otherwise was as obvious as the proverbial nose on your face? My blogging buddy Keith recently mentioned that his daughter, a college Freshman, was praised by her professor for writing a paper in his class in which she took exception to what the author had said. She was praised because she was one of the few students who disagreed with what she was reading and being told. She had asked herself the question: “why?” She was praised because she was one of the few who had done so. Little kids ask the question “why? repeatedly out of their natural curiosity. Their fathers and mothers answer until they are finally forced to say “because I said so.” Perhaps this stops the question, but not for long. The child soon begins again: “Why Daddy?” “Why Mommy?” Eventually they stop asking the question. And the schools rarely encourage students to ask the question, so the kids stop asking questions and increasingly believe what they are told — even by chronic liars who couldn’t tell a fact if it came up and bit them in the butt. Why is this? I never stopped asking this question after that first seminar. In fact, we had four years of seminars twice a week in which students were constantly asking the “why question.” It led me to philosophy where I have continued to ask the question ever since. Indeed, I wrote an ethics book that centers on the question “why?” in an attempt to encourage the students to ask that question at every turn — just as they did as little children. The “why question” requires that reasons be given for claims being made. One doesn’t simply accept as fact the things people say or write. One demands evidence and argument support — even in ethics, where we too frequently dismiss complex issues with the lazy response “who’s to say?”\nComplex issues demand thought and the refusal to stop asking the why question until we have reached a point where the answer seems to be staring us in the face. When the weight of the evidence seems to have provided the answer, it is time to stop (subject to further review). But we never know when we have reached that point until we have examined the issue from both sides and have eliminated all possibilities. It is an exhausting process, but it is what makes us think when we might otherwise allow our mental faculties to sleep and simply accept as true a claim that is blatantly false. You know, the kinds of things that certain politicians say all the time. There has never been a better time than the present to ask the “why question,” and we should not stop until it seems pointless to ask it any more. And that point cannot be reached without persistence and determination to know what is true and separate the true from the false, the absurd from the plausible, the reasonable from the unreasonable. We will never know where that point is until we have reached it. And it is best to have someone asking it with us, because two heads really are better than one — as I learned lo those many years ago in that seminar.",

            "passage": "Preparation for a Variety of Careers\nPhilosophy majors develop important and widely marketable skills, like the ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems. This means that getting a degree in philosophy provides excellent preparation for a variety of careers. Get Into Graduate School\nStudying philosophy can also help you get into graduate school. Philosophy majors excel on standardized tests like the GRE, GMAT, and LSAT. They rank first among all majors on the verbal and the analytical section of the GRE. Philosophy majors also tend to do better than just about any other major on the LSAT. With a mean score of just over 157, they are second only to physics majors. When it comes to the GMAT, philosophy majors rank in the top five of all majors, and they consistently have higher scores than business majors (including management, finance, accounting, and marketing majors). Philosophy majors get high-paying jobs too. PayScale Inc.’s current list of the Best Undergrad College Degrees By Salary lists the starting and mid-career salaries (15.5 years after graduation) for fifty different majors. Philosophy ranks sixteenth on their list when it comes to mid-career median salaries. At $81,200, philosophy majors stand to make $9,100 more than business majors at this stage in their career! Philosophy is Fascinating! Probably the best reason to study philosophy is that it’s one of the most stimulating and interesting fields. Philosophers try to answer questions like the following. What is knowledge and how is it different from mere belief or opinion? What sorts of things are most valuable and how should I live my life? Does God exist? Do we really have free will? How should society be organized and what sort of system of government is best?",

Ultimately, the most difficult tasks that students face is figuring out which direction they’d like to take their lives. “The economy is maybe slightly worse than it was,” he continued, “but you still have to face those hard choices.”\nTo Kingwell, the value of an undergraduate degree is the same now as it has always been. “It’s about training your mind and yourself,” he argued, “It means that you are going to be able to do all kinds of things.”\nKingwell is well aware of the fact that most students in his introductory level course may not take another philosophy course in their lives. But to him, there is great power in the notion of learning for learning’s sake. “The point is to expose them to the most interesting arguments that have been made about what [we’re] doing here,” he said. It truly irks Kingwell when people question the validity of an undergraduate degree, especially one in philosophy. “Are you trying to tell me that the time I spent thinking about the world and my place in it wasn’t worthwhile?” he retorted, “That doesn’t make sense to me.”\nAnd for those who think that philosophy is impractical, Kingwell is not one to reckon with: “It makes you think more clearly about yourself and the world. It makes you a better citizen, ultimately, and maybe even a better person,” he countered, “And there is nothing of practical value that you could rate higher than those things, in my opinion.”",

            "passage": "The profession of philosophy, largely under the leadership of the American Philosophical Association, has taken steps which, together with a pattern of a significant number of faculty approaching retirement, have gradually moved the market toward equilibrium between supply and demand of PhDs. Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy \"pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.",

Complete details on the CDL General Qualifications can be found here\n\nAge: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2. Driver's License: You must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record. 3. Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 4910-EX-P Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 49 CFRParts383 and 390 [Docket No. FMCSA-2011-0146]\nRegulatory Guidance: Applicability of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to Operators of Certain Farm Vehicles and Off-Road Agricultural Equipment AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), DOT. ACTION: Notice. This supposed \"rumor\" is listed in the Federal Register! And in among all the mumbo jumbo of legalese is an issue regarding \"interstate commerce\" versus \"intrastate commerce\". Isn't that the same argument being used to justify the health care overhaul? I don't know about you, but it makes me awful suspicious! And then you read that it's all been dropped, but the next news source says it's still under consideration. I honestly don't know where it stands (and would appreciate it if anyone out there could enlighten me). What I do know is that IF such legislation would ever be mandated, it would require farmers to:\n• Acquire a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL). • Display DOT numbers. • Register owners or farm name. • Limit mileage. • Obtain a medical card for the driver or maintain logs of hours worked and service records. To further add to the absurdity of this situation, age requirements would also limit young family members and senior citizens from driving the family tractor. My family were farmers, and I can tell you, that age was not a factor in getting the crops in, and my grandfather would be rolling over in his grave to think that the government could tell him he had to limit the miles his farm equipment could be employed, or that he had to keep records of how many hours he'd worked to show some government official! Farmers have known how to work their farms for centuries without government oversight, thank you very much! And if that is not enough, it seems that Americans are unaware of how another little-known Executive Order could soon affect us. Nearly a year ago, in June of 2011, Executive Order 13575 established the \"White House Rural Council to Strengthen Rural Communities\". Sounds like a rather honorable and decent commission doesn't it? Well, here is part of what this innocent-sounding Council is charged with: Section 4 of the executive order which describes the “Mission and Function of the Council” is frighteningly inclusive of just about every aspect of the rural community.\n\nFMCSA May Eliminate Driving Experience Criterion in Vision Exemption Process\nA proposed rule from the agency offers two options: driving with a stable vision condition for at least a year or no specific amount of CMV driving experience required. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is planning to change the eligibility requirements for someone seeking an exemption to operate a commercial motor vehicle without meeting the vision standards. Currently, and since 1998, the requirement has been three years of intrastate CMV driving experience immediately prior to the application date. There are other requirements, including being at least 21 years old, holding a valid license, and no license suspensions or convictions for serious traffic violations while operating any motor vehicle, even a personal vehicle. FMCSA has published a proposed rule Dec. 18 that offers two options: driving with a stable vision condition for at least a year or no specific amount of CMV driving experience required. Eliminating the experience requirement would be consistent with FMCSA’s diabetes exemption program, according to the rule. The criterion covering involvement in a crash, where the driver was cited for a moving violation or his\/her actions were a contributing factor in the crash, also is being tweaked by this rule. FMCSA states that it plans to use this definition of \"accident\" from 49 CFR 390.5 as being synonymous with \"crash\": \"An occurrence involving a CMV operating on a highway in interstate or intrastate commerce which results in:\n- \"A fatality;\n- \"Bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, receives immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or\n- \"One or more vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the motor vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle.\" FMCSA is accepting comments on the proposed rule (www.regulations.gov, Docket No. FMCSA-2013-0097) for 30 days.\n\nTruck Driver Shortage Prompts Pilot Program to Test Teen Commercial Drivers on Public Roads\nThe trucking industry has become known for its aggressive lobbying tactics, and for supporting regulatory rollbacks and new rules that allow commercial trucking operators to increase profits at the expense of public safety. This includes recent amendments to drop testing of commercial drivers with conditions like sleep apnea (which makes them more likely to crash), and efforts to pass laws that increase vehicle weight limits, terminate certain Hours-of-Service requirements regarding mandatory driver rest breaks, and reduce the federal age limit for commercial drivers from 21 to 18. With a recent announcement from federal regulators, younger truckers may soon be a common site on our roads. This month, officials from the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that they are preparing to launch a pilot program that would test out teen commercial drivers on public roads. Here are few important details about what it involves:\n- Under the FMCSA’s pilot program, drivers between 18 and 20 will be able to drive commercial trucks and vehicles across state lines. Currently, only drivers 21 and older can operate trucks for interstate commerce. - Only drivers who have military experience and training in certain occupational specialists will be allowed to participate in the program. - The pilot program will include policies that require young drivers to complete a 240-hour apprentice driving program where they may only drive with veteran CDL holders and may not exceed 65 mph. - The program is intended to roll out later this year. The announcement has received a great deal of attention, in part because proposed laws to reduce the federal commercial driver age limit have long been supported by the trucking industry since the start of a chronic shortage. In fact, reducing the age limit has been one of the industry’s top solutions for addressing the trucker shortage problem, which is expected to reach nearly 65,000 drivers this year. That’s equal to roughly one commercial tractor-trailer per every 12 cargo loads, the lowest ratio in 15 years. While it may seem like a reasonable solution to the commercial trucking operators and companies that want to keep up with a rising demand for transportation of consumer goods, the proposed age limit reduction has faced harsh scrutiny from public safety advocates who argue that it puts the public at risk while allowing major corporations to profit from cheap labor. Additionally, they cite statistics like those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which show that teen drivers are approximately 3 times more likely to fatally crash than drivers who are 20 or older. In response to these arguments, proponents and the trucking industry have pointed to the safety apprentice driving policy requiring young drivers to first train with more experienced drivers. They also commonly argue that 18-year-olds are currently allowed to operate commercial vehicles, though within state borders, in many states across the country. Trucking Regulations & Public Safety\nAs a personal injury and workers’ compensation law firm that fights for victims across Chicago and the state of Illinois, our legal team at Leonard Law Group knows how crucially important trucking regulations are to protecting the public and ensuring commercial operators take the necessary steps to reduce risks of serious truck accidents. Over the years, we’ve represented many victims of truck accidents, including drivers of passenger vehicles hit by truckers and truck drivers themselves, and are well aware of the devastating and often life-altering damage these massive machines can cause. Because commercial trucks pose such overwhelming dangers on our roads, we know it is important for advocates, lawmakers, and the public to keep apprised of trucking industry efforts fueled by money and potential profits rather than any concern for public safety. Just because the status quo may allow teens to get behind the wheel of trucks in some states doesn’t mean it should be preserved and strengthened across the board. That’s what many safety advocates will continue to focus on as they track the new pilot program and prepare to fight efforts for implementing the regulatory change nationwide. Fighting for Truck Accident Victims\nAlthough trucking regulations have been prone to change, there are still numerous laws that apply to trucking operators and drivers and make them responsible for taking appropriate safety measures.\n\nHow to Get a Commercial Drivers License in Indiana\nAll drivers must possess a CDL in Indiana in order to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in the state. The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) can issue a commercial drivers license to any driver that meets the state’s eligibility requirements and passes the state’s testing criteria. Applicants for a commercial license must be of a certain age, pass the necessary medical screening, be able to prove lawful presence in the U.S., and more, in order to be found eligible. Applications for a CDL license in Indiana must be submitted in person, to a BMV licensing agency. All drivers must apply for – and receive – their commercial permits before they will be allowed to apply for their full commercial licenses. Some drivers are exempt from needing to meet all of the state’s typical licensing requirements, like military personnel and some farmers. Drivers must complete knowledge exams and driving skills tests using a vehicle of the class and type that they will be licensed to operate. Several endorsements can be added to a license for drivers who meet the requirements. CDL Requirements in Indiana\nCDL requirements for drivers in Indiana include being at least 18 years of age at the time of submitting the application, if applying for an intrastate permit, or 21 years of age, if applying for an interstate license. Other CDL license requirements include:\n- Holding a valid IN driver’s license for at least one year before application. - Having a valid U.S. Social Security Number (SSN). - Passing the DOT medical exam (if applicable). - Passing the written CDL test. - Obtaining a learner’s permit. - Passing a driving skills test. How to Apply for a CDL Permit in Indiana\nAll Indiana drivers must first apply for – and receive – the CDL permit, or CLP, before they can be found eligible to apply for the full commercial operator’s license. Drivers applying for a CDL learners permit will be required to meet all of the abovementioned requirements, except for passing the driving skills test, which occurs later on to receive the full license. Applications for the CLP are accepted in person, at licensing agencies around the state. The BMV has an up-to-date list of all locations currently processing permit requests. According to IN CDL permit requirements, drivers will have to pass all of the written knowledge tests required, according to the type of license they are requesting. They will also be asked to pass a vision screening. Other requirements may be asked of drivers in some circumstances. Exam results are valid for 180 days. CDL Written Test in Indiana\nAll students must complete the general CDL written test, along with area-specific tests, depending on the driver’s vehicle class and desired endorsements. The CDL general knowledge test is required by all applying drivers, and along with any of the following exams:\n- All commercial vehicles drivers: General knowledge exam\n- All school bus drivers: School bus endorsement exam and passenger transport exam\n- All bus drivers: Passenger transport exam\n- Vehicle with air brakes: Air brakes exam\n- Combination of vehicles: Combination vehicle exam\n- Drivers required to transport hazardous material: Hazardous material exam\n- Drivers required to transport liquids in bulk: Tanker exam\n- Drivers required to pull double or triple trailers: Doubles\/triples exam\nIndiana CDL Training Schools & Practice Tests\nCDL prep for Indiana drivers begins with reviewing the Commercial Driver’s License Manual issued by the BMV, which includes all of the details new commercial drivers need to know for the written and skills exams. Drivers can also choose to enroll in CDL school at any of a number of state-approved locations across the state. The BMV oversees all schooling for commercial drivers in Indiana to assure that they offer top-quality instruction and have qualified teachers. Although enrolling in a program for extra CDL training is highly encouraged by the BMV, it is not one of the requirements for receiving a CLP or full license. Drivers looking for hands-on instruction from drivers with years of experience can especially benefit from signing up. The BMV regularly publishes a list of approved truck driver training schools in Indiana from which drivers can choose. How to Get a CDL License in Indiana\nWhen a driver is ready to apply for a full license, how to get a CDL comes down to scheduling the driving skills exam, and passing all of its parts at the same time.\n\nThese are large trucks, but commercial driver’s license requirements vary as they’re operated by those who need specialized training. All equipment must be up to code, but drivers must also follow the appropriate compliance measures before getting behind the wheel of a CMV. In a later section, the requirements for a commercial driver’s license (CDL) will be covered in detail. However, these are the various classes of licenses that drivers must obtain, depending on the truck they intend to operate. Class A CDL\nFor operating a gross vehicle weight of more than 26,000 pounds and a towed weight of over 10,000 pounds, a Class A license is required. Because of the heavy weight of the equipment, this is perhaps the most difficult license to get. Some examples of what you could operate with this license include:\n- Tractor Trailers\n- Livestock Carriers\n- Trucks and Trailers Combinations\n- Tank Vehicles\nClass B CDL\nIf the towed weight is less than 10,000 pounds, but the gross combination weight is over 26,000 pounds, you’ll only need a Class B license. You won’t be driving the largest loads, but you’ll still have a lot to handle. These operations include:\n- Straight Trucks\/Box Trucks\n- Large Passenger Buses\n- Dump Trucks (small trailers)\nCLASS C CDL\nWith this license, you can transport hazardous material or 15 other riders in addition to yourself. This will likely be smaller rides like vans, making the difference in driving less drastic than tractor trailers, but it will still take greater focus than your average pickup truck. With this license, you can operate:\n- Passenger Vans\n- Combination Setups Below the Weight Requirements of A and B Class\n- Smaller HazMat Trucks and Vans\nSuppose your truck or van meets the gross vehicle weight standards of a commercial vehicle according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association (FMCSA) and will at any time pass state lines. In that case, it will need a USDOT number. Registration can easily be completed online with the FMCSA. Have all documents for your commercial motor vehicle ready to make the process go as smoothly as possible. In addition to meeting federal regulations, commercial vehicles must also comply with local and state regulations. You may need to confirm whether your CMV is considered commercial in your state. If so, you’ll need to meet local inspection and maintenance requirements and register your truck or van. Even if you registered your vehicle with the FMCSA, you still register with the local authorities for a local DOT number. Uses of a Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV)\nMany focus on the requirements of the gross combination weight rating with a towed unit to determine the CMV definition. However, an important part of the definition is the purpose and how the CMV is used. A company may rely on a CMV for many reasons. These reasons determine not only the best type of CMV for their purposes but also what unique regulations may be in place. Below are examples of why companies may rely on a CMV for business. Perhaps one of the most popular uses of commercial vehicles is to transport goods. The larger the truck, the more it will be able to transport in one trip while also carrying bulkier items that may not easily fit in smaller delivery vans. During transportation, trucks must be weighed to ensure they aren’t exceeding their maximum weight capacity as a safety precaution. Transporting Material Found to Be Hazardous\nHazardous materials come in many forms, including liquids, gases, solids, and sludges. They may be a byproduct of manufacturing and industrial processes. They must be removed from the site securely to ensure safety for those working at the site. However, they must also be transported carefully to avoid harming people along the way to their destination. This calls for specialized commercial vehicles and regulations. Commercial vehicles may be used to transport passengers, and motor carriers receive compensation for the service. This may be on buses or passenger vans. If the carrier can hold 15 riders plus the driver, it cannot be considered a passenger automobile. Intrastate commerce, as opposed to interstate commerce, is trucking conducted within one state’s borders., The load starts in one state and doesn’t leave the state to reach its destination. Motor carriers may choose to conduct only intrastate deliveries to avoid the additional fees or if they only have vendors and sales made within one state. Unlike intrastate commerce, interstate commerce requires crossing state lines, even temporarily, to complete deliveries.\n\nIf you want to enter the world of truck driving, then you should apply for a CDL or commercial driver’s license training. However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck. You also need to be specific about the type of commercial vehicle that you will be practicing on.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of the Drive Safe Act, you may be either shocked or pleased to learn that a bill has been filed that would authorize 18-21 year olds to drive 18-wheelers professionally on the interstate, whereas now they must be 21. In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act\nOn February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety\/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

GVWR or more interstate you must have a commercial driver's license (CDL) and you must follow FMCSR. - If you are driving a vehicle or combination of vehicles 26,001 lbs. GVWR or more intrastate, you must follow your state guidelines for commercial licensing (CDL), and FMCSR requirements. Farm exemptions can be obtained in some instances, but the vehicle must stay within 150 miles of home. Many states require trucks and trailers to have license plates that are labeled \"commercial\" but this does not always mean you are considered \"commercial\" in all states.

Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.",

ACTION: Notice. This supposed \"rumor\" is listed in the Federal Register! And in among all the mumbo jumbo of legalese is an issue regarding \"interstate commerce\" versus \"intrastate commerce\". Isn't that the same argument being used to justify the health care overhaul? I don't know about you, but it makes me awful suspicious! And then you read that it's all been dropped, but the next news source says it's still under consideration. I honestly don't know where it stands (and would appreciate it if anyone out there could enlighten me). What I do know is that IF such legislation would ever be mandated, it would require farmers to:\n• Acquire a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL). • Display DOT numbers. • Register owners or farm name. • Limit mileage. • Obtain a medical card for the driver or maintain logs of hours worked and service records. To further add to the absurdity of this situation, age requirements would also limit young family members and senior citizens from driving the family tractor. My family were farmers, and I can tell you, that age was not a factor in getting the crops in, and my grandfather would be rolling over in his grave to think that the government could tell him he had to limit the miles his farm equipment could be employed, or that he had to keep records of how many hours he'd worked to show some government official! Farmers have known how to work their farms for centuries without government oversight, thank you very much! And if that is not enough, it seems that Americans are unaware of how another little-known Executive Order could soon affect us. Nearly a year ago, in June of 2011, Executive Order 13575 established the \"White House Rural Council to Strengthen Rural Communities\". Sounds like a rather honorable and decent commission doesn't it? Well, here is part of what this innocent-sounding Council is charged with: Section 4 of the executive order which describes the “Mission and Function of the Council” is frighteningly inclusive of just about every aspect of the rural community.",

Currently, and since 1998, the requirement has been three years of intrastate CMV driving experience immediately prior to the application date. There are other requirements, including being at least 21 years old, holding a valid license, and no license suspensions or convictions for serious traffic violations while operating any motor vehicle, even a personal vehicle.

Eliminating the experience requirement would be consistent with FMCSA’s diabetes exemption program, according to the rule. The criterion covering involvement in a crash, where the driver was cited for a moving violation or his\/her actions were a contributing factor in the crash, also is being tweaked by this rule. FMCSA states that it plans to use this definition of \"accident\" from 49 CFR 390.5 as being synonymous with \"crash\": \"An occurrence involving a CMV operating on a highway in interstate or intrastate commerce which results in:\n- \"A fatality;\n- \"Bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, receives immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or\n- \"One or more vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the motor vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle.\" FMCSA is accepting comments on the proposed rule (www.regulations.gov, Docket No. FMCSA-2013-0097) for 30 days.",

            "passage": "Truck Driver Shortage Prompts Pilot Program to Test Teen Commercial Drivers on Public Roads\nThe trucking industry has become known for its aggressive lobbying tactics, and for supporting regulatory rollbacks and new rules that allow commercial trucking operators to increase profits at the expense of public safety. This includes recent amendments to drop testing of commercial drivers with conditions like sleep apnea (which makes them more likely to crash), and efforts to pass laws that increase vehicle weight limits, terminate certain Hours-of-Service requirements regarding mandatory driver rest breaks, and reduce the federal age limit for commercial drivers from 21 to 18. With a recent announcement from federal regulators, younger truckers may soon be a common site on our roads. This month, officials from the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that they are preparing to launch a pilot program that would test out teen commercial drivers on public roads. Here are few important details about what it involves:\n- Under the FMCSA’s pilot program, drivers between 18 and 20 will be able to drive commercial trucks and vehicles across state lines. Currently, only drivers 21 and older can operate trucks for interstate commerce. - Only drivers who have military experience and training in certain occupational specialists will be allowed to participate in the program. - The pilot program will include policies that require young drivers to complete a 240-hour apprentice driving program where they may only drive with veteran CDL holders and may not exceed 65 mph. - The program is intended to roll out later this year. The announcement has received a great deal of attention, in part because proposed laws to reduce the federal commercial driver age limit have long been supported by the trucking industry since the start of a chronic shortage. In fact, reducing the age limit has been one of the industry’s top solutions for addressing the trucker shortage problem, which is expected to reach nearly 65,000 drivers this year. That’s equal to roughly one commercial tractor-trailer per every 12 cargo loads, the lowest ratio in 15 years. While it may seem like a reasonable solution to the commercial trucking operators and companies that want to keep up with a rising demand for transportation of consumer goods, the proposed age limit reduction has faced harsh scrutiny from public safety advocates who argue that it puts the public at risk while allowing major corporations to profit from cheap labor. Additionally, they cite statistics like those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which show that teen drivers are approximately 3 times more likely to fatally crash than drivers who are 20 or older. In response to these arguments, proponents and the trucking industry have pointed to the safety apprentice driving policy requiring young drivers to first train with more experienced drivers. They also commonly argue that 18-year-olds are currently allowed to operate commercial vehicles, though within state borders, in many states across the country. Trucking Regulations & Public Safety\nAs a personal injury and workers’ compensation law firm that fights for victims across Chicago and the state of Illinois, our legal team at Leonard Law Group knows how crucially important trucking regulations are to protecting the public and ensuring commercial operators take the necessary steps to reduce risks of serious truck accidents. Over the years, we’ve represented many victims of truck accidents, including drivers of passenger vehicles hit by truckers and truck drivers themselves, and are well aware of the devastating and often life-altering damage these massive machines can cause. Because commercial trucks pose such overwhelming dangers on our roads, we know it is important for advocates, lawmakers, and the public to keep apprised of trucking industry efforts fueled by money and potential profits rather than any concern for public safety. Just because the status quo may allow teens to get behind the wheel of trucks in some states doesn’t mean it should be preserved and strengthened across the board. That’s what many safety advocates will continue to focus on as they track the new pilot program and prepare to fight efforts for implementing the regulatory change nationwide. Fighting for Truck Accident Victims\nAlthough trucking regulations have been prone to change, there are still numerous laws that apply to trucking operators and drivers and make them responsible for taking appropriate safety measures.",

The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) can issue a commercial drivers license to any driver that meets the state’s eligibility requirements and passes the state’s testing criteria. Applicants for a commercial license must be of a certain age, pass the necessary medical screening, be able to prove lawful presence in the U.S., and more, in order to be found eligible. Applications for a CDL license in Indiana must be submitted in person, to a BMV licensing agency. All drivers must apply for – and receive – their commercial permits before they will be allowed to apply for their full commercial licenses. Some drivers are exempt from needing to meet all of the state’s typical licensing requirements, like military personnel and some farmers. Drivers must complete knowledge exams and driving skills tests using a vehicle of the class and type that they will be licensed to operate. Several endorsements can be added to a license for drivers who meet the requirements. CDL Requirements in Indiana\nCDL requirements for drivers in Indiana include being at least 18 years of age at the time of submitting the application, if applying for an intrastate permit, or 21 years of age, if applying for an interstate license. Other CDL license requirements include:\n- Holding a valid IN driver’s license for at least one year before application. - Having a valid U.S. Social Security Number (SSN). - Passing the DOT medical exam (if applicable). - Passing the written CDL test. - Obtaining a learner’s permit. - Passing a driving skills test. How to Apply for a CDL Permit in Indiana\nAll Indiana drivers must first apply for – and receive – the CDL permit, or CLP, before they can be found eligible to apply for the full commercial operator’s license. Drivers applying for a CDL learners permit will be required to meet all of the abovementioned requirements, except for passing the driving skills test, which occurs later on to receive the full license. Applications for the CLP are accepted in person, at licensing agencies around the state. The BMV has an up-to-date list of all locations currently processing permit requests. According to IN CDL permit requirements, drivers will have to pass all of the written knowledge tests required, according to the type of license they are requesting. They will also be asked to pass a vision screening. Other requirements may be asked of drivers in some circumstances. Exam results are valid for 180 days. CDL Written Test in Indiana\nAll students must complete the general CDL written test, along with area-specific tests, depending on the driver’s vehicle class and desired endorsements. The CDL general knowledge test is required by all applying drivers, and along with any of the following exams:\n- All commercial vehicles drivers: General knowledge exam\n- All school bus drivers: School bus endorsement exam and passenger transport exam\n- All bus drivers: Passenger transport exam\n- Vehicle with air brakes: Air brakes exam\n- Combination of vehicles: Combination vehicle exam\n- Drivers required to transport hazardous material: Hazardous material exam\n- Drivers required to transport liquids in bulk: Tanker exam\n- Drivers required to pull double or triple trailers: Doubles\/triples exam\nIndiana CDL Training Schools & Practice Tests\nCDL prep for Indiana drivers begins with reviewing the Commercial Driver’s License Manual issued by the BMV, which includes all of the details new commercial drivers need to know for the written and skills exams. Drivers can also choose to enroll in CDL school at any of a number of state-approved locations across the state. The BMV oversees all schooling for commercial drivers in Indiana to assure that they offer top-quality instruction and have qualified teachers. Although enrolling in a program for extra CDL training is highly encouraged by the BMV, it is not one of the requirements for receiving a CLP or full license. Drivers looking for hands-on instruction from drivers with years of experience can especially benefit from signing up. The BMV regularly publishes a list of approved truck driver training schools in Indiana from which drivers can choose. How to Get a CDL License in Indiana\nWhen a driver is ready to apply for a full license, how to get a CDL comes down to scheduling the driving skills exam, and passing all of its parts at the same time.",

            "passage": "These are large trucks, but commercial driver’s license requirements vary as they’re operated by those who need specialized training. All equipment must be up to code, but drivers must also follow the appropriate compliance measures before getting behind the wheel of a CMV. In a later section, the requirements for a commercial driver’s license (CDL) will be covered in detail. However, these are the various classes of licenses that drivers must obtain, depending on the truck they intend to operate. Class A CDL\nFor operating a gross vehicle weight of more than 26,000 pounds and a towed weight of over 10,000 pounds, a Class A license is required. Because of the heavy weight of the equipment, this is perhaps the most difficult license to get. Some examples of what you could operate with this license include:\n- Tractor Trailers\n- Livestock Carriers\n- Trucks and Trailers Combinations\n- Tank Vehicles\nClass B CDL\nIf the towed weight is less than 10,000 pounds, but the gross combination weight is over 26,000 pounds, you’ll only need a Class B license. You won’t be driving the largest loads, but you’ll still have a lot to handle. These operations include:\n- Straight Trucks\/Box Trucks\n- Large Passenger Buses\n- Dump Trucks (small trailers)\nCLASS C CDL\nWith this license, you can transport hazardous material or 15 other riders in addition to yourself. This will likely be smaller rides like vans, making the difference in driving less drastic than tractor trailers, but it will still take greater focus than your average pickup truck. With this license, you can operate:\n- Passenger Vans\n- Combination Setups Below the Weight Requirements of A and B Class\n- Smaller HazMat Trucks and Vans\nSuppose your truck or van meets the gross vehicle weight standards of a commercial vehicle according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association (FMCSA) and will at any time pass state lines. In that case, it will need a USDOT number. Registration can easily be completed online with the FMCSA. Have all documents for your commercial motor vehicle ready to make the process go as smoothly as possible. In addition to meeting federal regulations, commercial vehicles must also comply with local and state regulations. You may need to confirm whether your CMV is considered commercial in your state. If so, you’ll need to meet local inspection and maintenance requirements and register your truck or van. Even if you registered your vehicle with the FMCSA, you still register with the local authorities for a local DOT number. Uses of a Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV)\nMany focus on the requirements of the gross combination weight rating with a towed unit to determine the CMV definition. However, an important part of the definition is the purpose and how the CMV is used. A company may rely on a CMV for many reasons. These reasons determine not only the best type of CMV for their purposes but also what unique regulations may be in place. Below are examples of why companies may rely on a CMV for business. Perhaps one of the most popular uses of commercial vehicles is to transport goods. The larger the truck, the more it will be able to transport in one trip while also carrying bulkier items that may not easily fit in smaller delivery vans. During transportation, trucks must be weighed to ensure they aren’t exceeding their maximum weight capacity as a safety precaution. Transporting Material Found to Be Hazardous\nHazardous materials come in many forms, including liquids, gases, solids, and sludges. They may be a byproduct of manufacturing and industrial processes. They must be removed from the site securely to ensure safety for those working at the site. However, they must also be transported carefully to avoid harming people along the way to their destination. This calls for specialized commercial vehicles and regulations. Commercial vehicles may be used to transport passengers, and motor carriers receive compensation for the service. This may be on buses or passenger vans. If the carrier can hold 15 riders plus the driver, it cannot be considered a passenger automobile. Intrastate commerce, as opposed to interstate commerce, is trucking conducted within one state’s borders., The load starts in one state and doesn’t leave the state to reach its destination. Motor carriers may choose to conduct only intrastate deliveries to avoid the additional fees or if they only have vendors and sales made within one state. Unlike intrastate commerce, interstate commerce requires crossing state lines, even temporarily, to complete deliveries.",

            "passage": "If you want to enter the world of truck driving, then you should apply for a CDL or commercial driver’s license training. However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck. You also need to be specific about the type of commercial vehicle that you will be practicing on.",

In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act\nOn February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety\/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

You can actually switch between these on the fly to get the best angle to take on the incoming bad guys. This is not only very impressive, but adds a whole another level of depth to the game play by giving you different options. And yes you can even do this in multiplayer too, in the middle of a 16 player online dog fight, you can land and get out of your plane at different parts in the level and man AA guns, then jump back in your plane and take off again. Besides the levels main missions, you have the option of flying around the large levels and finding different side missions as well to earn extra money for plane upgrades. Just like GTA, you get to pick when and how you do your missions to some degree. The game will never say \"you must do this, or that first\", you have total control and freedom to choose what ever missions you want to do, as well as the options of finding other side missions to do as well. This freedom of choice is a very welcome feature. As most of you probably have noticed by now, Crimson Skies looks great. In fact, I will go on record and say it is easy one of the best looking Xbox titles out there. The levels are big and very detailed, with mostly high detail texture maps. The water is easily some of the best seen so far on Xbox if not the best. And there’s more to it then just pretty looks, it's being rendered in multiple passes which helps keep it from getting that classic \"tiled\" look that most games suffer from when you are a great distance from the texture. The lighting effects are also top notch as are the explosions, which again, are some of the more impressive seen to date. They are big, fiery and light up the world nicely. You can also see lots of debris flying from them as well, which always rocks :)! When shooting some of the larger objects in the game, like the Zeppelins, you will notice that they take real time damage just like the buildings do in Mech Assault. You can fallow your shots and watch as they impact the sides of the air ships leaving fiery holes. And even as you shoot more and more in contained areas, you will see them take heavy damage and blow up and catch fire. Very very impressive and adds even more detail to the game. The sound is also very good. The explosions and gun fire sound great, and all of the voice actors are very well done and really fit in well with the theme of this game. Crimson Skies will support 16 player online play via Xbox Live when it ships this fall. All of the basic modes of play and features will be there, such as the classic death match and team death match as well as some new modes of play that we will cover in detail later. So far we have only been able to play it on a LAN, but so far so good. Assuming the online play is as smooth, this is going to be a killer online title this fall, and a must have for anyone with Xbox Live, regardless if they like flight based games or not. Crimson Skies will also support downloadable content too, but so far nothing has been revealed yet. But just the thought of being able, at some point, to add even more stuff to a game that already has a ton of reply value just rocks. Even though Crimson Skies was delayed over a year, the extra time has really paid off. They took an average title, and turned it into one of the best Xbox games this year. That is saying a lot and much kudos to the development team on this one. Their hard work has really paid off. More articles about Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge\n\nYo ho! Yo ho! A pirate's life for me. Okay, when I say pirates, what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Chances\nare, you just pictured the skull and crossbones, some dude that looks like Captain\nHook, or even that drunk guy hanging out with a pig in the Pirates of the Caribbean\nride at Disneyland. But what if the path of history took a different course\nand pirates turned out to be smooth talking, fearless warriors of the air rather\nthan liquor-guzzling sea ruffians? Well, Microsoft and Zipper Interactive have\nimagined just that and cranked out a game worthy of an old Hollywood studio. It is a world of gutsy pilots and high adventure. The Great Depression has\nstruck, destroying the progress of all ground transportation, leaving the skies\nto serve as the ultimate roadway of the future. Here, survival means gripping\nthe flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the\ntalking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding\nflight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n\"story\" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.\n\nA couple years back Microsoft took a step away from its hardcore flight-sim fanbase to entertain the masses. Crimson Skies was a barnstorming jolt of adrenalin set in an alternate timeline, featuring aerial hardware that made even fans of commercial airline simulations take notice. Now the sequel is preparing to land on the Xbox. If I didn't know better, I'd say that Microsoft was feeling some pressure from Nintendo's Rogue Squadron franchise. As in the RS games, you fly and dogfight in missions that range from simple escorts to seek and destroy extravaganzas. But unrestrained by licensing, Crimson Skies looks like it's able to take on much more interesting ground with far more freedom than you'll find behind the windscreen of a snowspeeder. The first obvious pointer is the main character, Nathan Zachary. His introduction involves the back end of a losing poker game and an embarrassing morning after with a casino girl. While I'm neither advocating nor decrying this glamorization of the dissolute, it's nice to see that this post-Vice City world allows boozers of loose moral fiber to have equal representation in games. Nathan's a pretty constant presence through frequent voice-over, and is joined by a too-chatty female sidekick and numerous other characters. The game background has thankfully carried over from the previous game. Setting up a post-WWI scenario that's as much Philip K. Dick as The Rocketeer, Crimson Skies posits an America divided, with groups like the Nation Of Hollywood and the Empire State vying for control of the skies and waterways. There's a lot of nifty production design that borders on seafaring steampunk, as island locations are marred by twisting girder constructs, and the rusting shells of broken airships freckle the coastline. But the key detail is that the skies are laden with technologically advanced planes and giant airships, all bearing powerful guns. Nearing Cruising Altitude\nSkies a couple of times already, but since we took to the clouds at E3 quite a few developments have been made. Earlier previews pointed out the roster of ten planes, and controls that are designed from the arcade out. In other words, anyone can play, and the emphasis is on quick, vicious and showy combat. Evasive maneuvers are made easy by the use of simple analog stick combos. Instead of propelling you along a railed track a la the Star Wars shooters, Crimson Skies gives you a playground and free reign. The demo shows off a couple of island vistas - the primary location is Sky Island, dominated by a large (and active) volcano. The ability to fly anywhere is great, especially as primary and side missions are scattered across the landscape, and can be approached seemingly at any time. Planes and boats are all over the place, going about various and sundry business. But there's not much window-dressing here - if it's in the sky, you can make it fall. You'll end up shooting down plenty of targets for the cash they carry, which will help trick out your, er, glide. As detailed in earlier previews, taking a mission is as simple as flying near a flashing icon and hitting 'X'. The same goes for dropping into repair shops and swinging into your pad.\n\nIt’s nice to see some new screens from Crimson Skies after so much radio silence. These shots are fine by me, love them, but please, please, please tell me this game will be online. I was big into it on the PC, and I will cry myself to sleep if this game comes out with only solo play. The Getaway comes out today. I really want to get it, mainly because I’ve been looking forward to it so long - I recognize that is a poor decision making strategy. Greg “Hot” Kasavin was not terribly kind to the game, but he gave it a fair shake. There are good and bad reviews out there, apparently the good bits are good enough for some people to overlook the rest of it. Also, DOA: Xtreme Etcetera hits tomorrow. I said I’d give BMX XXX a shot a few weeks ago, but testers for the game assured me that there was nothing praiseworthy there. But DOA? I mean, I’m just sort of curious. I don’t even know what kind of game it is, really. What the fuck genre is that?\n\nI was able to play a few levels at a Capcom event yesterday and also bring a build to the office, giving me a look at a few levels from various bits of the game as well as the opening sequences. The game starts off with you playing as soldier, testing out a new Tesla-designed rocket pack. Of course, no game would be complete without a sneak attack by the enemy, so a group of UFOs show up to give you an introduction to the game's flight mechanics. After dispatching a group of them, the character you start with looks to be killed and you then take control of the game's protagonist, Will, about a week later. By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you've played Crimson Skies, you'll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn't very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there's a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you'll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you're still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you're shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you're standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can't even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this'll be much more natural by this point. While the flight bits feel a lot like Crimson Skies (which is great), the ground combat is very much akin to what you'll find in a lot of third-person shooters these days, which makes it easy to jump right into. You can take cover and then fire blindly, aim down your sights with some guns and generally go about things like you would in something like Uncharted or Gears of War. Again though, what makes this unique is the ability to take to the skies at pretty much any time and change up the way you take on combat. You won't always have flight, though. Early on in the game, once you take control of Will, you'll be on foot and fighting enemies in a more \"classic\" sense until you eventually find the jet pack. This opening sequence takes place in the jungle, and while you won't find the sort of platforming bits to do ala Uncharted, it does make for a rather stark contrast to the more mechanical stuff you'll see later on. An example of this is a cylindrical generator shaft that you'll come to later where you're tasked with shutting down the power. Blue electrical bolts fly pretty much everywhere here, and the deep chasm formed by the shaft means that you'll have to make use of your hover ability a lot during combat. Dark Void is set to ship early next year. In the meantime, take a look at our media pages for new screens and video, and keep your eyes peeled for details on how you can win a Tesla Roadster as part of a promotional giveaway that Capcom is holding for the game.\n\n\"Grant Howitt's games are always strong on play experiences.

The sort of game experience that’s not just fun, but actually rewarding to play.\" - Gav Thorpe, author of Inquisitor and, like, half the Warhammer 40k universe\nWHAT IS THE SPIRE? Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.\n\nAre there going to be linear missions in the game, or will it\nbe more like half-life and unreal where you seamlessly go from\none area to the next? The missions don't have to be connected to each other, but the\nlevels are. Youíll move seamlessly between them and sometimes\nyouíll get interrupted by those scripted sequences I mentioned\nWhat will the weapons be like in the final game? Well, I canít expand to much on this one for the moment. Youíll\nhave a lot of different weapons - donít worry ;-). Also, donít\nforget that the vehicles are equipped with heavy gunpower too. Are you spending any time on the enemy AI, will it be any better\nthen any other games? Sure, you canít do a game of this kind without AI. Though, if\nit will be better or worse than any other game on the market\ntoday is impossible to tell before the game is finished. Muliplayer. What kind will it have (deathmatch)? Is is even\ngoing to have any? Yes. Multiplay is supported. I think weíre aiming for teamplay\nmore than deathmatch Ė I really would like to see some new approach\nto the multiplay. Still, I tend to look at it more as a single\nAre you planning on including any really cool new never before\nseen features? What will separate your game from all the other\nI canít reveal it here and now, can I? ;-). But the blend of\ngenres is a rather new one and hopefully weíll show some other\nstuff tooÖ I think the overall impression will feel new and\nfresh but thatís more of a game design question I think.\n\nYou can see where the cyclical nature of the game comes in, which will ensure that people keep coming back for more, time and time again. The controls in Pixel People are something that most players will have to get used to. It’s not that they’re difficult, far from it – you’re only touching the screen – but some of the items are so small that even the slimmest of fingers may have trouble tapping on the correct building from time to time. It doesn’t take away from the enjoyment too much however, and you’ll soon learn where the best place to tap is, but even when playing on the iPad – the game supports iCloud saving so swapping from device to device isn’t a problem – you may find yourself tapping on the totally wrong place. Even more so because you can’t play the game in landscape mode, even on the iPad, which feels somewhat strange. If you’re a fan of time-management sims and a fan of pixel art, then Pixel People is absolutely the game that you’ve been waiting for. It is bright, colourful, engaging and addictive. People will have a huge amount of fun finding all the potential splicing combinations, finding places for them to live and upgrading their exciting new city. I even found myself checking the progress first thing in the morning, even before my emails! CRIMSON SHROUD by Martin Baker:\nI don’t think I’ve seen many games on any of the mobile\/handheld formats that task the player with regularly throwing dice as if they’re playing a classic game of Dungeons & Dragons, but if any console could do it it’d be the 3DS. The device’s touch screen is perfect for the tactile feedback of actually throwing dice, and the power of the 3DS means that we can get some decent quality, and decent length, games out of it too. Enter Crimson Shroud, essentially a JRPG but with heavy leanings towards a tabletop gaming style. The game is developed by Level-5, a developer that’s quickly gaining a name for itself in the JRPG market, but does this digitally downloadable title hold up to the rest of their catalogue? Crimson Shroud takes a little bit of getting used to at first. It’s not immediately obvious that what you’re playing is an interactive tabletop game so the fact that the characters in the cutscenes literally don’t move is a little strange and difficult to get used to. All of the action takes place in still shots of the character models with text overlaid on the screen, as if you were really playing around with miniatures and having a dungeonmaster shouting the story at you. At certain points in the narrative you’ll be able to make decisions – such as one near the start of the game which asks you to either dodge or parry an incoming arrow – and it’s then your job to roll the dice to see if that move is successful or not. Roll below the required number and you’re taking an arrow to the chest. The main crux of the gameplay comes with the encounters. These are the turn-based battles that we’re so used to when it comes to this genre of RPG. The turn-based action plays out exactly as you’d expect it would with the player taking turns to do damage to the enemy until one of you – hopefully your opponent – is defeated. You can do damage through the use of attacks, magic or skills, and efficient use of all three of these – which can also be modified by dice throws if you have any in your inventory – is the key to success. Once the battle is over you’ll be given a certain number of barter points based on how well you performed in battle. These barter points are used to collect the items that the enemies drop once they’re defeated, but you can only pick up as many as you have barter points for, so be careful. The different ways that the game plays out, as well as the long sections when you’re doing nothing except advancing the text, takes a lot to get used to but once you’re settled with it, it’s rather rewarding. For the most part, the only button you’ll be using is the ‘A’ button. This is the button you’ll use to progress the text as well as selecting enemies you want to attack.\n\nIn the land of video games, it always amazes me that a plot-line starting with “A wizard, a rogue, and a warrior” isn’t immediately followed by “…walk into a bar.” Ultimately that is what Crimson Alliance, a new XBLA title from Certain Affinity, is all about. Well, perhaps the foreign land of Byzan instead of bar, and instead of walking they’re running as fast as possible and leaving a trail of death and dismemberment behind them. The basic action\/RPG gameplay and visual presentation mirrors games like Torchlight or the much anticipated Diablo III; the key difference is that they do away with all that messy depth. If this sounds like a bad thing, you should read on. Crimson Alliance does what a lot of other games don’t – it is unapologetic in its presentation, and puts up rather than shuts up. While there are hidden rooms and treasures to find on almost every level, there is no creeping around, side quests or path-finding – the game is all about unabashed combat regardless of the character you select. Furthermore, you aren’t subjected to five minute CGI cutscenes during major plot points: instead you hear banter and background between the three protaganists while watching slideshows of beautifully painted scenes that give the game a very organic feel. Some of the comments have even had me laughing out loud, even if the main plot twist is plainly obvious. One of the other things that this Action-RPG-Lite game does right trying is not saddling you with stats management or a complex inventory system. There are three item types (which vary depending on class): your main weapon, your secondary weapon, and your armor. Each of the three will boost up to four stats in a range from 1-20 : your three basic attack types (damage, stun, clearing) as well as your health. There are also special powers available on some equipment, and each item will show its impact to your overall stats. Every 5 points in each respective category earns you a significant improvement to the skill i.e. thrown daggers may fly farther and faster at level 5, 10, 15, and 20 on top of the natural damage increases that each point earns. You can also switch your equipment without going to an inventory screen, but the downside is that the game doesn’t pause during this process. Certain Affinity also saw fit to include four types of single-use items that help you during battle, and each is assigned to your directional pad and triggered with the RB button (more on that later). You have a health totem which refills your health over time based on proximity, an automatic turret that pelts enemies in range, a fiery axe which is thrown like a grenade, and monster bait. You can carry a maximum of three of each at a time, and if you’re playing multiplayer you can even drop them to share with others by holding the RB button down. I suppose the question of value is really the question of quality – what is quality? It is the measure of delivering to people’s expectations. This game isn’t Diablo III or even Torchlight. If there were one game I’d compare it to it would be Castle Crashers – it doesn’t have the same art, but just like Castle Crashers the combat is accessible, the upgrades are simple to understand and it allows you to balance and tweak your combat style based on your equipment. One other improvement I would have suggested is allowing the gamers to change buttons. I found that having my RB trigger items and my LB trigger my “ultra” move it didn’t work for me as well as I would have liked.. I would rather have had my items trigger with a directional press, and perhaps allowing me to switch weapon types on the fly with the RB. This isn’t a knock against the game, but spending as much time as I did with the Crimson Alliance, this would have added some neat dynamics that could have maximized the on-the-fly equipment change effect.\n\nCrimson Dragon ReviewJon Ledford |\nThe dragon riding rail shooter has returned! At the helm of Crimson Dragon is Yukio Futatsugi, who was the director of the first three Panzer Dragoon titles. Alongside Panzer series composer Saori Kobayashi, Crimson Dragon has taken up the dragon rider's mantle which hasn't been occupied since Panzer Dragoon Orta was released in 2002. It looks like Sega has wanted to leave the series alone, but an oppressive industry hasn't stopped rambunctious, dragon riding heroes from rebelling, right? At first glance, Crimson Dragon has nearly everything you would expect from a Panzer Dragoon title. Many of Futatsugi's old teammates went on to make Rez and Child of Eden, and both were widely embraced by fans and critics alike. But as beautiful and fantastic as Rez and Eden each were, they were rather lighthearted and did not contain any giant dragons. Futatsugi has been quite vocal about wanting to apply the same formula to Crimson Dragon — make a rail shooter and continue the franchise with an RPG in the same universe. So let's see if Panzer's spiritual successor is the next Dovahkin in the world and is worthy to the mantle of Sega's cult classic series. Crimson Dragon is, at its heart, a grindfest. Crimson Dragon does the tried and true Starfox routine of traversing through a level on rails but being able to maneuver your dragon around on the screen as you shoot down enemies and huge monsters. It also tries to employ the World of Warcraft approach of having to repeatedly farm the levels and bosses in the hopes of trying to find a specific item just to unlock the next level. But the rate at which this occurs is absurd. If the required items were a guaranteed drop, or even have a 50% drop rate, then yes, this would be acceptable. But expect to find yourself constantly farming the same level over and over, just to find out that the next level looks similar and reuses the same areas as the last. We must say that the size of some of these monsters and boss dragons are so huge that we were impressed. We haven't been this impressed by enemy size this massive since the first time we played Monster Hunter or Shadow of the Colossus. These moments are awe-inspiring, it's just a shame that they are surrounded by frustrating gameplay before, after and during these immense encounters. And much of this frustration can be attributed to Crimson Dragon's camera system combined with the constant speed at which your dragon flies through the levels. That's right, one of the main fallacies of this on-rail shooter is its camera, which is a fundamental and basic part of the on-rail experience. Having an automatic camera system, you would think that Grounding Inc. would try to keep your path clean so that you can efficiently clear enemies and avoid getting hurt. But the paths which Crimson Dragon take you to are convoluted and have plenty of sharp camera turns. While these camera and directional changes are expected, the enemies of Crimson Dragon are relentless, offering you very little time to actually take them out before they start damaging you. We thought that we had excellent reflexes and response times in terms of our gameplay skills, but Crimson Dragon left us dead in the air plenty of times. This all boils to the point of frustration where the average player will probably not want to even try. It's not that Crimson Dragon is too difficult of a game, it's just that the enemies attack like clockwork and are relentless. Even when you hire a wingman from the leaderboard to help you out, you will still find yourself coming up short when trying to finish a level. Slap on the easiest difficulty, and you will still find yourself dying frequently. While we're glad that Crimson Dragon doesn't pull its punches and doesn't attempt to hold your hand, it's just that its camera system and enemy A.I. are not oriented towards the overall gameplay experience. Crimson Dragon's story is rather laughable and acts simply an excuse to get a teenager on the back of a dragon and start going to war with an entire world that is out to get them both.\n\nQuestion:What kind of gameplay features can I expect from Crimson Spires? I'm curious about how it plays.",
    "passages": [
        {
            "passage": "Even better, the ship has a few different sets of AA guns at different locations on the ship. You can actually switch between these on the fly to get the best angle to take on the incoming bad guys. This is not only very impressive, but adds a whole another level of depth to the game play by giving you different options. And yes you can even do this in multiplayer too, in the middle of a 16 player online dog fight, you can land and get out of your plane at different parts in the level and man AA guns, then jump back in your plane and take off again. Besides the levels main missions, you have the option of flying around the large levels and finding different side missions as well to earn extra money for plane upgrades. Just like GTA, you get to pick when and how you do your missions to some degree. The game will never say \"you must do this, or that first\", you have total control and freedom to choose what ever missions you want to do, as well as the options of finding other side missions to do as well. This freedom of choice is a very welcome feature. As most of you probably have noticed by now, Crimson Skies looks great. In fact, I will go on record and say it is easy one of the best looking Xbox titles out there. The levels are big and very detailed, with mostly high detail texture maps. The water is easily some of the best seen so far on Xbox if not the best. And there’s more to it then just pretty looks, it's being rendered in multiple passes which helps keep it from getting that classic \"tiled\" look that most games suffer from when you are a great distance from the texture. The lighting effects are also top notch as are the explosions, which again, are some of the more impressive seen to date. They are big, fiery and light up the world nicely. You can also see lots of debris flying from them as well, which always rocks :)! When shooting some of the larger objects in the game, like the Zeppelins, you will notice that they take real time damage just like the buildings do in Mech Assault. You can fallow your shots and watch as they impact the sides of the air ships leaving fiery holes. And even as you shoot more and more in contained areas, you will see them take heavy damage and blow up and catch fire. Very very impressive and adds even more detail to the game. The sound is also very good. The explosions and gun fire sound great, and all of the voice actors are very well done and really fit in well with the theme of this game. Crimson Skies will support 16 player online play via Xbox Live when it ships this fall. All of the basic modes of play and features will be there, such as the classic death match and team death match as well as some new modes of play that we will cover in detail later. So far we have only been able to play it on a LAN, but so far so good. Assuming the online play is as smooth, this is going to be a killer online title this fall, and a must have for anyone with Xbox Live, regardless if they like flight based games or not. Crimson Skies will also support downloadable content too, but so far nothing has been revealed yet. But just the thought of being able, at some point, to add even more stuff to a game that already has a ton of reply value just rocks. Even though Crimson Skies was delayed over a year, the extra time has really paid off. They took an average title, and turned it into one of the best Xbox games this year. That is saying a lot and much kudos to the development team on this one. Their hard work has really paid off. More articles about Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge",

Here, survival means gripping\nthe flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the\ntalking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding\nflight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n\"story\" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.",

            "passage": "A couple years back Microsoft took a step away from its hardcore flight-sim fanbase to entertain the masses. Crimson Skies was a barnstorming jolt of adrenalin set in an alternate timeline, featuring aerial hardware that made even fans of commercial airline simulations take notice. Now the sequel is preparing to land on the Xbox. If I didn't know better, I'd say that Microsoft was feeling some pressure from Nintendo's Rogue Squadron franchise. As in the RS games, you fly and dogfight in missions that range from simple escorts to seek and destroy extravaganzas. But unrestrained by licensing, Crimson Skies looks like it's able to take on much more interesting ground with far more freedom than you'll find behind the windscreen of a snowspeeder. The first obvious pointer is the main character, Nathan Zachary. His introduction involves the back end of a losing poker game and an embarrassing morning after with a casino girl. While I'm neither advocating nor decrying this glamorization of the dissolute, it's nice to see that this post-Vice City world allows boozers of loose moral fiber to have equal representation in games. Nathan's a pretty constant presence through frequent voice-over, and is joined by a too-chatty female sidekick and numerous other characters. The game background has thankfully carried over from the previous game. Setting up a post-WWI scenario that's as much Philip K. Dick as The Rocketeer, Crimson Skies posits an America divided, with groups like the Nation Of Hollywood and the Empire State vying for control of the skies and waterways. There's a lot of nifty production design that borders on seafaring steampunk, as island locations are marred by twisting girder constructs, and the rusting shells of broken airships freckle the coastline. But the key detail is that the skies are laden with technologically advanced planes and giant airships, all bearing powerful guns. Nearing Cruising Altitude\nSkies a couple of times already, but since we took to the clouds at E3 quite a few developments have been made. Earlier previews pointed out the roster of ten planes, and controls that are designed from the arcade out. In other words, anyone can play, and the emphasis is on quick, vicious and showy combat. Evasive maneuvers are made easy by the use of simple analog stick combos. Instead of propelling you along a railed track a la the Star Wars shooters, Crimson Skies gives you a playground and free reign. The demo shows off a couple of island vistas - the primary location is Sky Island, dominated by a large (and active) volcano. The ability to fly anywhere is great, especially as primary and side missions are scattered across the landscape, and can be approached seemingly at any time. Planes and boats are all over the place, going about various and sundry business. But there's not much window-dressing here - if it's in the sky, you can make it fall. You'll end up shooting down plenty of targets for the cash they carry, which will help trick out your, er, glide. As detailed in earlier previews, taking a mission is as simple as flying near a flashing icon and hitting 'X'. The same goes for dropping into repair shops and swinging into your pad.",

            "passage": "I was able to play a few levels at a Capcom event yesterday and also bring a build to the office, giving me a look at a few levels from various bits of the game as well as the opening sequences. The game starts off with you playing as soldier, testing out a new Tesla-designed rocket pack. Of course, no game would be complete without a sneak attack by the enemy, so a group of UFOs show up to give you an introduction to the game's flight mechanics. After dispatching a group of them, the character you start with looks to be killed and you then take control of the game's protagonist, Will, about a week later. By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you've played Crimson Skies, you'll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn't very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there's a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you'll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you're still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you're shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you're standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can't even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this'll be much more natural by this point. While the flight bits feel a lot like Crimson Skies (which is great), the ground combat is very much akin to what you'll find in a lot of third-person shooters these days, which makes it easy to jump right into. You can take cover and then fire blindly, aim down your sights with some guns and generally go about things like you would in something like Uncharted or Gears of War. Again though, what makes this unique is the ability to take to the skies at pretty much any time and change up the way you take on combat. You won't always have flight, though. Early on in the game, once you take control of Will, you'll be on foot and fighting enemies in a more \"classic\" sense until you eventually find the jet pack. This opening sequence takes place in the jungle, and while you won't find the sort of platforming bits to do ala Uncharted, it does make for a rather stark contrast to the more mechanical stuff you'll see later on. An example of this is a cylindrical generator shaft that you'll come to later where you're tasked with shutting down the power. Blue electrical bolts fly pretty much everywhere here, and the deep chasm formed by the shaft means that you'll have to make use of your hover ability a lot during combat. Dark Void is set to ship early next year. In the meantime, take a look at our media pages for new screens and video, and keep your eyes peeled for details on how you can win a Tesla Roadster as part of a promotional giveaway that Capcom is holding for the game.",

Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.",

The controls in Pixel People are something that most players will have to get used to. It’s not that they’re difficult, far from it – you’re only touching the screen – but some of the items are so small that even the slimmest of fingers may have trouble tapping on the correct building from time to time. It doesn’t take away from the enjoyment too much however, and you’ll soon learn where the best place to tap is, but even when playing on the iPad – the game supports iCloud saving so swapping from device to device isn’t a problem – you may find yourself tapping on the totally wrong place. Even more so because you can’t play the game in landscape mode, even on the iPad, which feels somewhat strange. If you’re a fan of time-management sims and a fan of pixel art, then Pixel People is absolutely the game that you’ve been waiting for. It is bright, colourful, engaging and addictive. People will have a huge amount of fun finding all the potential splicing combinations, finding places for them to live and upgrading their exciting new city. I even found myself checking the progress first thing in the morning, even before my emails! CRIMSON SHROUD by Martin Baker:\nI don’t think I’ve seen many games on any of the mobile\/handheld formats that task the player with regularly throwing dice as if they’re playing a classic game of Dungeons & Dragons, but if any console could do it it’d be the 3DS. The device’s touch screen is perfect for the tactile feedback of actually throwing dice, and the power of the 3DS means that we can get some decent quality, and decent length, games out of it too. Enter Crimson Shroud, essentially a JRPG but with heavy leanings towards a tabletop gaming style. The game is developed by Level-5, a developer that’s quickly gaining a name for itself in the JRPG market, but does this digitally downloadable title hold up to the rest of their catalogue? Crimson Shroud takes a little bit of getting used to at first. It’s not immediately obvious that what you’re playing is an interactive tabletop game so the fact that the characters in the cutscenes literally don’t move is a little strange and difficult to get used to. All of the action takes place in still shots of the character models with text overlaid on the screen, as if you were really playing around with miniatures and having a dungeonmaster shouting the story at you. At certain points in the narrative you’ll be able to make decisions – such as one near the start of the game which asks you to either dodge or parry an incoming arrow – and it’s then your job to roll the dice to see if that move is successful or not. Roll below the required number and you’re taking an arrow to the chest. The main crux of the gameplay comes with the encounters. These are the turn-based battles that we’re so used to when it comes to this genre of RPG. The turn-based action plays out exactly as you’d expect it would with the player taking turns to do damage to the enemy until one of you – hopefully your opponent – is defeated. You can do damage through the use of attacks, magic or skills, and efficient use of all three of these – which can also be modified by dice throws if you have any in your inventory – is the key to success. Once the battle is over you’ll be given a certain number of barter points based on how well you performed in battle. These barter points are used to collect the items that the enemies drop once they’re defeated, but you can only pick up as many as you have barter points for, so be careful. The different ways that the game plays out, as well as the long sections when you’re doing nothing except advancing the text, takes a lot to get used to but once you’re settled with it, it’s rather rewarding. For the most part, the only button you’ll be using is the ‘A’ button. This is the button you’ll use to progress the text as well as selecting enemies you want to attack.",

            "passage": "In the land of video games, it always amazes me that a plot-line starting with “A wizard, a rogue, and a warrior” isn’t immediately followed by “…walk into a bar.” Ultimately that is what Crimson Alliance, a new XBLA title from Certain Affinity, is all about. Well, perhaps the foreign land of Byzan instead of bar, and instead of walking they’re running as fast as possible and leaving a trail of death and dismemberment behind them. The basic action\/RPG gameplay and visual presentation mirrors games like Torchlight or the much anticipated Diablo III; the key difference is that they do away with all that messy depth. If this sounds like a bad thing, you should read on. Crimson Alliance does what a lot of other games don’t – it is unapologetic in its presentation, and puts up rather than shuts up. While there are hidden rooms and treasures to find on almost every level, there is no creeping around, side quests or path-finding – the game is all about unabashed combat regardless of the character you select. Furthermore, you aren’t subjected to five minute CGI cutscenes during major plot points: instead you hear banter and background between the three protaganists while watching slideshows of beautifully painted scenes that give the game a very organic feel. Some of the comments have even had me laughing out loud, even if the main plot twist is plainly obvious. One of the other things that this Action-RPG-Lite game does right trying is not saddling you with stats management or a complex inventory system. There are three item types (which vary depending on class): your main weapon, your secondary weapon, and your armor. Each of the three will boost up to four stats in a range from 1-20 : your three basic attack types (damage, stun, clearing) as well as your health. There are also special powers available on some equipment, and each item will show its impact to your overall stats. Every 5 points in each respective category earns you a significant improvement to the skill i.e. thrown daggers may fly farther and faster at level 5, 10, 15, and 20 on top of the natural damage increases that each point earns. You can also switch your equipment without going to an inventory screen, but the downside is that the game doesn’t pause during this process. Certain Affinity also saw fit to include four types of single-use items that help you during battle, and each is assigned to your directional pad and triggered with the RB button (more on that later). You have a health totem which refills your health over time based on proximity, an automatic turret that pelts enemies in range, a fiery axe which is thrown like a grenade, and monster bait. You can carry a maximum of three of each at a time, and if you’re playing multiplayer you can even drop them to share with others by holding the RB button down. I suppose the question of value is really the question of quality – what is quality? It is the measure of delivering to people’s expectations. This game isn’t Diablo III or even Torchlight. If there were one game I’d compare it to it would be Castle Crashers – it doesn’t have the same art, but just like Castle Crashers the combat is accessible, the upgrades are simple to understand and it allows you to balance and tweak your combat style based on your equipment. One other improvement I would have suggested is allowing the gamers to change buttons. I found that having my RB trigger items and my LB trigger my “ultra” move it didn’t work for me as well as I would have liked.. I would rather have had my items trigger with a directional press, and perhaps allowing me to switch weapon types on the fly with the RB. This isn’t a knock against the game, but spending as much time as I did with the Crimson Alliance, this would have added some neat dynamics that could have maximized the on-the-fly equipment change effect.",

            "passage": "Crimson Dragon ReviewJon Ledford |\nThe dragon riding rail shooter has returned! At the helm of Crimson Dragon is Yukio Futatsugi, who was the director of the first three Panzer Dragoon titles. Alongside Panzer series composer Saori Kobayashi, Crimson Dragon has taken up the dragon rider's mantle which hasn't been occupied since Panzer Dragoon Orta was released in 2002. It looks like Sega has wanted to leave the series alone, but an oppressive industry hasn't stopped rambunctious, dragon riding heroes from rebelling, right? At first glance, Crimson Dragon has nearly everything you would expect from a Panzer Dragoon title. Many of Futatsugi's old teammates went on to make Rez and Child of Eden, and both were widely embraced by fans and critics alike. But as beautiful and fantastic as Rez and Eden each were, they were rather lighthearted and did not contain any giant dragons. Futatsugi has been quite vocal about wanting to apply the same formula to Crimson Dragon — make a rail shooter and continue the franchise with an RPG in the same universe. So let's see if Panzer's spiritual successor is the next Dovahkin in the world and is worthy to the mantle of Sega's cult classic series. Crimson Dragon is, at its heart, a grindfest. Crimson Dragon does the tried and true Starfox routine of traversing through a level on rails but being able to maneuver your dragon around on the screen as you shoot down enemies and huge monsters. It also tries to employ the World of Warcraft approach of having to repeatedly farm the levels and bosses in the hopes of trying to find a specific item just to unlock the next level. But the rate at which this occurs is absurd. If the required items were a guaranteed drop, or even have a 50% drop rate, then yes, this would be acceptable. But expect to find yourself constantly farming the same level over and over, just to find out that the next level looks similar and reuses the same areas as the last. We must say that the size of some of these monsters and boss dragons are so huge that we were impressed. We haven't been this impressed by enemy size this massive since the first time we played Monster Hunter or Shadow of the Colossus. These moments are awe-inspiring, it's just a shame that they are surrounded by frustrating gameplay before, after and during these immense encounters. And much of this frustration can be attributed to Crimson Dragon's camera system combined with the constant speed at which your dragon flies through the levels. That's right, one of the main fallacies of this on-rail shooter is its camera, which is a fundamental and basic part of the on-rail experience. Having an automatic camera system, you would think that Grounding Inc. would try to keep your path clean so that you can efficiently clear enemies and avoid getting hurt. But the paths which Crimson Dragon take you to are convoluted and have plenty of sharp camera turns. While these camera and directional changes are expected, the enemies of Crimson Dragon are relentless, offering you very little time to actually take them out before they start damaging you. We thought that we had excellent reflexes and response times in terms of our gameplay skills, but Crimson Dragon left us dead in the air plenty of times. This all boils to the point of frustration where the average player will probably not want to even try. It's not that Crimson Dragon is too difficult of a game, it's just that the enemies attack like clockwork and are relentless. Even when you hire a wingman from the leaderboard to help you out, you will still find yourself coming up short when trying to finish a level. Slap on the easiest difficulty, and you will still find yourself dying frequently. While we're glad that Crimson Dragon doesn't pull its punches and doesn't attempt to hold your hand, it's just that its camera system and enemy A.I. are not oriented towards the overall gameplay experience. Crimson Dragon's story is rather laughable and acts simply an excuse to get a teenager on the back of a dragon and start going to war with an entire world that is out to get them both.",

Child Care Subsidy Eligibility\nSome basic requirements must be satisfied for an individual to be eligible to receive Child Care Subsidy for a child. These include:\n- the age of the child (must be aged 13 or under and not attending secondary school, except in certain circumstances where an individual may be eligible for a child who does not meet this criteria, such as children with a disability or medical condition in certain circumstances)\n- the child meeting immunisation requirements\n- the individual, or their partner, meeting the residency requirements listed in the legislation. In addition, to be eligible for Child Care Subsidy the individual must be liable to pay for care provided, the care must be delivered in Australia by an approved child care provider, and not be part of a compulsory education program. Child Care Subsidy entitlement\nThere are three factors that determine a family's level of Child Care Subsidy. These are:\n- Combined annual family income\n- Activity test – the activity level of both parents\n- Service type – type of child care service and whether the child attends school\nThe Child Care Subsidy is generally paid directly to service providers to be passed on to families as a fee reduction. Families make a co-contribution to their child care fees and pay to the provider the difference between the fee charged and the subsidy amount. There is also targeted additional fee assistance for vulnerable families through the Child Care Safety Net. Families can get an estimate of what they may be entitled to by entering their details into the Services Australia Payment and Service Finder. A range of information resources are available to assist families and providers.\n\nThe parent PLUS loan is a federal loan that is just one option available to parents looking to cover outstanding costs related to college attendance. Before applying for a parent PLUS loan, understand student loan basics and what you, as parents, should know before applying for a student loan. Then, carefully consider the features, benefits and drawbacks of a parent PLUS loan. Features of the Parent PLUS Loan\n- Availability: The parent PLUS loan is available to biological and adoptive parents, and in some cases stepparents, of undergraduate students who do not have adverse credit history. Some colleges may include the PLUS Loan in a student's financial aid; however, just because a PLUS Loan is included does not mean that parents are required to accept it. - Limits: A parent can borrow up to the cost of attendance, an amount that is determined by the student's school, minus other financial assistance received by the student. - Interest rate: Parent PLUS loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, have a fixed interest rate of 8.05%. Like other federal student loans, the interest rate for new PLUS loans changes annually on July 1. - Repayment: Borrowers may choose from different plans to repay the loan over a 10-year period. Loans of more than $30,000 are eligible for an extended repayment period that allows borrowers up to 25 years to repay the loan. Repayment generally begins as soon as the loan is disbursed, but parents may request to defer repayment while the student is enrolled at least half time plus an additional six months. Benefits of the Parent PLUS Loan\n- Pre- and overpayment: Some borrowers choose to make extra payments to pay down parent PLUS loans more quickly and to reduce the amount of interest repaid. There is no penalty for paying extra on PLUS Loans. - Federal repayment options: Borrowers may choose from different federal repayment plans to fit their budget, but most income-driven repayment plans are not options for parent PLUS loans. These loans also have deferment and forbearance options for borrowers who have difficulty making payments; however, interest continues to accrue daily even when payments are not required. Unpaid, accumulated interest will be capitalized, or added to the loan balance, at the end of the deferment or forbearance period. - Death and disability: The loan can be discharged if the parent borrower dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled. In addition, the loan can be discharged if the student dies. - Cancellation: If a parent applies for a PLUS Loan, he or she can cancel all or part of the amount before the loan is disbursed to the school. After disbursement, borrowers have a limited time to cancel all or part of the loan amount by contacting the school's financial aid office. Drawbacks of the Parent PLUS Loan\n- Discharge: Federal parent PLUS loans are rarely discharged for financial difficulties resulting from unemployment, age-related or other illnesses and injuries, or bankruptcy. - Nontransferable: Parents cannot transfer the PLUS loan to their student to repay after they finish school. Parents and their students may be able to work together to refinance the loan in the student's name through a private lender, although doing so will result in the loss of federal repayment options. - Timing: Many parents face high education debt burdens at a time of life when earning power generally decreases and limited income is needed for living or medical expenses. Defaulting on a parent PLUS loan can lead to the garnishment of Social Security benefits, tax refunds and wages. Other Considerations Before Taking Out a Parent PLUS Loan\nThe following items could be considered a drawback or a benefit, depending on personal and other circumstances. - Qualification: Approval for a PLUS Loan does not take into consideration a parent's income, other outstanding debt, assets or years until retirement, so parents should carefully consider how much they can realistically repay. - Interest: The fixed interest rate will not increase during the life of the loan, but borrowers also won't be able to take advantage of lower market rates in the future unless they refinance with a private lender. Before taking on a parent PLUS loan, you should also compare it to other options, such as our College Family Loan, which is a private education loan with a cosigner option and no fees.

It’s a time when you owe the Canadian government, via the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, a great deal of money. For others, though, it’s a time of excitement as you await a highly anticipated refund. Many Canadians use their refunds to make lump sum payments on large expenses, pay off last year’s holiday, or just to enjoy a bit of a shopping spree to celebrate their refunds. Regardless of whether you’re paying in or receiving a refund from your taxes this year, the first step is filing your taxes – and that’s not always a simple matter. These tips for failing taxes in Canada might help you pay less money in or get more money back. Use them well as you prepare to file taxes this year. Refunds today come in the form of direct deposits. Canada will no longer be issuing cheques for all of the following payments:\n- Canada Child Tax Benefit\n- Canada Pension Plans\n- GST\/HST Tax Credits\n- Income Tax refunds\n- Old Age Security\n- Universal Child Care Benefits\n- Working Income Tax Benefits (advanced payments)\nDirect Deposit eliminates the hassle of cashing cheques, ensures faster receipt of funds, and eliminates fraud related to mailing and cashing cheques. Parents with Children May Qualify for many Tax Savings\nThere are many tax credits available to parents with children that are designed to help you pay for things like child care, college, fitness programs and more. Make sure you’re taking full advantage of the many tax credits, cuts, and benefits available to you, including those listed below. The Family Tax Cut Credit\nWhile not exactly income splitting, the Family Tax Cut credit allows for a tax credit that is non-refundable, of up to $2,000 by shifting up to $50,000 worth of taxable income to the lower income spouse provided they have an eligible child under the age of 18 residing with them throughout the year. Children’s Fitness Credit\nTax credit allows you to claim up to $150 per child for participation in eligible sports and fitness activities. Children under the age of 16 are eligible for the program and the maximum credit for the family is $1,000. In order for the program to qualify it must be at least eight weeks in duration and meet weekly during that time. A sports or fitness day camp may qualify provided that it operates five consecutive days. Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB)\nThis tax credit varies from year to year based on parental income, inflation, and other factors. The tax credit amount is recalculated in July and the payments are divided into 12 monthly payments. In order to continue receiving the benefit, you and your spouse or common-law partner, must file returns on time every year –even if you don’t have an income for that year. Children living at home under the age of 18 may qualify for the tax credit. Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB)\nRegardless of income, all families may receive up to $160 each month for each child under the age of six. Children between the ages of six and 17 will receive a benefit of $60 per child. This benefit eliminates the child tax benefit of years past, but will have no impact on the Canada Child Tax benefit listed above. Child Care Deduction\nThis is different than the UCCB in that it is a deduction rather than a tax credit. It effectively lowers the amount of taxable income of the parent with the lower income by allowing that parent to claim up to $8,000 for each child under the age of seven. Parents are eligible to claim up to $5,000 for each child aged seven to 16 and may claim a deduction of up to $11,000 for children who are eligible for disability. National Child Benefit Supplement\nThis federal supplement effects low income families with children under the age of 18. Families receive a monthly payment for each child up to three children. The monthly payment per child is lower for the second and third child and may reduce eligibility for social assistance in many provinces and territories that treat this supplement as income. Families with a net income above $25,584 may experience a reduction in this supplement. Life Changes that may Affect Your Taxes\nAs you’ve seen above the life change of having a single child can have a significant impact on your taxes. The birth of a child is not the only change that can affect your federal income tax. The following changes can have a strong effect as well. - Becoming a student. - Becoming disabled. - Buying a home. - Changing employment. - Getting an inheritance. - Getting married.\n\nIn this article, we discuss the top two child plans from LIC. We talk about their benefits and how they can be of use to you and your child. Take a look. Life Insurance Corporation of India, or LIC, as it is commonly known is one of the oldest and the most reputed life insurance companies in the country. It has some very good insurance products. The child insurance plans from LIC especially stand out as they have some of the best features. In this article, we take a look at the LIC child plans and their features and benefits. What is a child plan? Before we proceed, let us first understand what a child plan is. A child insurance plan provides protection to a child by covering his parent. The parent is, therefore, the policyholder and the child is the beneficiary. So if anything happens to the parent, the sum assured from the child plan will be given to the child and can be used for her or his education, health and general well-being. LIC child insurance plans\nThere are primarily two child plans available from LIC. They are:\n- LIC Child Future Plan\n- LIC Child Career Plan\nLet us take a detailed look at these plans. LIC Child Future Plan\nThe features of this LIC child plan are as follows:\n- Waiver of premium: The premium is waived off if the parent, who is the policyholder, dies within the policy period. The insurer pays the premium on behalf of the parent and the plan continues with its regular payouts. - Money back plan: This is a money back insurance plan where the child gets payouts at regular intervals. The payouts can be used to pay the child’s school and college admission fees and also to pay for her or his marriage later on in life. - Death benefit and sum assured: If the parent dies with policy period, the nominee receives a death benefit right away along with any bonus that has been earned. If however the policy period is outlived, an amount equivalent to 115% of the sum assured is paid to the child. - Additional cover: The child continues to stay covered for an added term of 7 years after the policy matures. These features make the LIC Child Future Plan one of the best child insurance plans in India presently. LIC Child Career Plan\nNext, we have the Child Career Plan from LIC. This too is a money back plan where the child receives payouts at pre-decided intervals. The features of this plan include:\n- Waiver of premium: Here too, the premium is waived off if the parent dies within the policy period. The child continues to remain covered however. He or she receives an additional coverage of 7 years after the policy matures. - Survival benefit: The LIC Child Career Plan provides a survival benefit. A sum equivalent to 30% of the sum assured is paid in this case. - Maturity benefit: When the policy matures, the child receives an additional amount, equivalent to 15% of the sum assured, along with the accumulated bonus. - High age bracket: The plan can be taken for children between the ages of 0 month and 12 years. The maturity age of the policy varies between 23 and 27 years. These are some of the features that make the LIC Child Career Plan stand out. To sum it up\nAs we saw, the LIC child plans are packed with benefits. As a parent, you must do everything within your power to protect your child. A child is a gift and the gift needs care. So buy a child plan from the Life Insurance Corporation of India and keep your precious child secured. After all, you would want him or her to enjoy a comfortable life even after you are gone.\n\nIn the hope of helping you, Saveonenergy.com\/uk\/ compiled a list of 5 of the best apps to help children manage money.

But don’t worry, you will get an instant notification whenever they use the card and can set weekly spending limits. 2. Rooster Money\nRooster Money will let you keep track of the total owed for things like pocket money or completed chores. One nice feature of this app is the ability to add pictures of items that kids are saving up for and set a savings target, which is great for helping your child to visualise the end goal. Children will also be able to see how much money they have saved and how they’ve spent it in an easy to read statement. The makers of iAllowance claim it’s had a role in getting over 20 million chores completed. This useful app will allow you to track the amount of allowance you owe to each child and virtually “prompt” them to finish tasks and chores linked to their pocket money earning potential! The information syncs across devices, and you can even email or print reports on how your child is doing. Gimi is designed to help you and your child keep track of their allowance and chores, but also to provide financial education along the way. A virtual piggy bank fills with the weekly allowance you set, and you can define rewards for specific tasks.

A bright and friendly app!\n\nEvery parent wants to be able to provide their child with a bright financial future, but did you know that you can save money for your child without risks and government restrictions? An index universal life insurance policy allows you to save for your child’s future with no market risk, deferred taxes, and no rules about what your child can or cannot do with the money. There are many benefits to this type of coverage. The policy has a living benefit, which you or your child can access at any time, as well as a death benefit that can be used to pay for funeral or other final expenses if your child passes away. You can earn interest on your money based on a fixed rate or an interest rate based on an equity or bond index. There is no market risk, meaning that you will earn interest when the market is up, but will not lose money when the market decreases. This allows you to earn more interest than you would in a regular savings account. The taxes on the interest are deferred until you begin to withdraw money from the policy. When you or your child access the cash value of the plan, you will not have to pay income tax on the money you withdraw from the policy. This coverage also has flexible benefits and premiums, so you can customize a plan to fit your family’s needs. Many people believe that a 529 plan is the only way to save for your child’s education, but you are penalized if your child chooses not to attend college. With index universal life insurance, your child can use the money for anything he or she chooses – there are no restrictions! If you are interested in an index universal life insurance policy for your child, fill out the form to the right or call today and you’ll receive a free quote from one of our certified insurance specialists.\n\nQuestion:What are the specific features and benefits of the Child Care Plus savings product for parents looking to save their child benefit payments?",

            "passage": "The Child Care Subsidy that commenced on 2 July 2018:\n- replaced the Child Care Benefit (CCB) and Child Care Rebate (CCR) with a single, means-tested subsidy\n- is generally paid directly to child care providers to be passed on to families\n- is simpler than the previous multi-payment system\n- is better targeted and provides more assistance to low and middle income families. Child Care Subsidy Eligibility\nSome basic requirements must be satisfied for an individual to be eligible to receive Child Care Subsidy for a child. These include:\n- the age of the child (must be aged 13 or under and not attending secondary school, except in certain circumstances where an individual may be eligible for a child who does not meet this criteria, such as children with a disability or medical condition in certain circumstances)\n- the child meeting immunisation requirements\n- the individual, or their partner, meeting the residency requirements listed in the legislation. In addition, to be eligible for Child Care Subsidy the individual must be liable to pay for care provided, the care must be delivered in Australia by an approved child care provider, and not be part of a compulsory education program. Child Care Subsidy entitlement\nThere are three factors that determine a family's level of Child Care Subsidy. These are:\n- Combined annual family income\n- Activity test – the activity level of both parents\n- Service type – type of child care service and whether the child attends school\nThe Child Care Subsidy is generally paid directly to service providers to be passed on to families as a fee reduction. Families make a co-contribution to their child care fees and pay to the provider the difference between the fee charged and the subsidy amount. There is also targeted additional fee assistance for vulnerable families through the Child Care Safety Net. Families can get an estimate of what they may be entitled to by entering their details into the Services Australia Payment and Service Finder. A range of information resources are available to assist families and providers.",

            "passage": "The parent PLUS loan is a federal loan that is just one option available to parents looking to cover outstanding costs related to college attendance. Before applying for a parent PLUS loan, understand student loan basics and what you, as parents, should know before applying for a student loan. Then, carefully consider the features, benefits and drawbacks of a parent PLUS loan. Features of the Parent PLUS Loan\n- Availability: The parent PLUS loan is available to biological and adoptive parents, and in some cases stepparents, of undergraduate students who do not have adverse credit history. Some colleges may include the PLUS Loan in a student's financial aid; however, just because a PLUS Loan is included does not mean that parents are required to accept it. - Limits: A parent can borrow up to the cost of attendance, an amount that is determined by the student's school, minus other financial assistance received by the student. - Interest rate: Parent PLUS loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2023, have a fixed interest rate of 8.05%. Like other federal student loans, the interest rate for new PLUS loans changes annually on July 1. - Repayment: Borrowers may choose from different plans to repay the loan over a 10-year period. Loans of more than $30,000 are eligible for an extended repayment period that allows borrowers up to 25 years to repay the loan. Repayment generally begins as soon as the loan is disbursed, but parents may request to defer repayment while the student is enrolled at least half time plus an additional six months. Benefits of the Parent PLUS Loan\n- Pre- and overpayment: Some borrowers choose to make extra payments to pay down parent PLUS loans more quickly and to reduce the amount of interest repaid. There is no penalty for paying extra on PLUS Loans. - Federal repayment options: Borrowers may choose from different federal repayment plans to fit their budget, but most income-driven repayment plans are not options for parent PLUS loans. These loans also have deferment and forbearance options for borrowers who have difficulty making payments; however, interest continues to accrue daily even when payments are not required. Unpaid, accumulated interest will be capitalized, or added to the loan balance, at the end of the deferment or forbearance period. - Death and disability: The loan can be discharged if the parent borrower dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled. In addition, the loan can be discharged if the student dies. - Cancellation: If a parent applies for a PLUS Loan, he or she can cancel all or part of the amount before the loan is disbursed to the school. After disbursement, borrowers have a limited time to cancel all or part of the loan amount by contacting the school's financial aid office. Drawbacks of the Parent PLUS Loan\n- Discharge: Federal parent PLUS loans are rarely discharged for financial difficulties resulting from unemployment, age-related or other illnesses and injuries, or bankruptcy. - Nontransferable: Parents cannot transfer the PLUS loan to their student to repay after they finish school. Parents and their students may be able to work together to refinance the loan in the student's name through a private lender, although doing so will result in the loss of federal repayment options. - Timing: Many parents face high education debt burdens at a time of life when earning power generally decreases and limited income is needed for living or medical expenses. Defaulting on a parent PLUS loan can lead to the garnishment of Social Security benefits, tax refunds and wages. Other Considerations Before Taking Out a Parent PLUS Loan\nThe following items could be considered a drawback or a benefit, depending on personal and other circumstances. - Qualification: Approval for a PLUS Loan does not take into consideration a parent's income, other outstanding debt, assets or years until retirement, so parents should carefully consider how much they can realistically repay. - Interest: The fixed interest rate will not increase during the life of the loan, but borrowers also won't be able to take advantage of lower market rates in the future unless they refinance with a private lender. Before taking on a parent PLUS loan, you should also compare it to other options, such as our College Family Loan, which is a private education loan with a cosigner option and no fees.

            "passage": "For some Canadians, income tax season is the most dreaded time of year. It’s a time when you owe the Canadian government, via the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA, a great deal of money. For others, though, it’s a time of excitement as you await a highly anticipated refund. Many Canadians use their refunds to make lump sum payments on large expenses, pay off last year’s holiday, or just to enjoy a bit of a shopping spree to celebrate their refunds. Regardless of whether you’re paying in or receiving a refund from your taxes this year, the first step is filing your taxes – and that’s not always a simple matter. These tips for failing taxes in Canada might help you pay less money in or get more money back. Use them well as you prepare to file taxes this year. Refunds today come in the form of direct deposits. Canada will no longer be issuing cheques for all of the following payments:\n- Canada Child Tax Benefit\n- Canada Pension Plans\n- GST\/HST Tax Credits\n- Income Tax refunds\n- Old Age Security\n- Universal Child Care Benefits\n- Working Income Tax Benefits (advanced payments)\nDirect Deposit eliminates the hassle of cashing cheques, ensures faster receipt of funds, and eliminates fraud related to mailing and cashing cheques. Parents with Children May Qualify for many Tax Savings\nThere are many tax credits available to parents with children that are designed to help you pay for things like child care, college, fitness programs and more. Make sure you’re taking full advantage of the many tax credits, cuts, and benefits available to you, including those listed below. The Family Tax Cut Credit\nWhile not exactly income splitting, the Family Tax Cut credit allows for a tax credit that is non-refundable, of up to $2,000 by shifting up to $50,000 worth of taxable income to the lower income spouse provided they have an eligible child under the age of 18 residing with them throughout the year. Children’s Fitness Credit\nTax credit allows you to claim up to $150 per child for participation in eligible sports and fitness activities. Children under the age of 16 are eligible for the program and the maximum credit for the family is $1,000. In order for the program to qualify it must be at least eight weeks in duration and meet weekly during that time. A sports or fitness day camp may qualify provided that it operates five consecutive days. Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB)\nThis tax credit varies from year to year based on parental income, inflation, and other factors. The tax credit amount is recalculated in July and the payments are divided into 12 monthly payments. In order to continue receiving the benefit, you and your spouse or common-law partner, must file returns on time every year –even if you don’t have an income for that year. Children living at home under the age of 18 may qualify for the tax credit. Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB)\nRegardless of income, all families may receive up to $160 each month for each child under the age of six. Children between the ages of six and 17 will receive a benefit of $60 per child. This benefit eliminates the child tax benefit of years past, but will have no impact on the Canada Child Tax benefit listed above. Child Care Deduction\nThis is different than the UCCB in that it is a deduction rather than a tax credit. It effectively lowers the amount of taxable income of the parent with the lower income by allowing that parent to claim up to $8,000 for each child under the age of seven. Parents are eligible to claim up to $5,000 for each child aged seven to 16 and may claim a deduction of up to $11,000 for children who are eligible for disability. National Child Benefit Supplement\nThis federal supplement effects low income families with children under the age of 18. Families receive a monthly payment for each child up to three children. The monthly payment per child is lower for the second and third child and may reduce eligibility for social assistance in many provinces and territories that treat this supplement as income. Families with a net income above $25,584 may experience a reduction in this supplement. Life Changes that may Affect Your Taxes\nAs you’ve seen above the life change of having a single child can have a significant impact on your taxes. The birth of a child is not the only change that can affect your federal income tax. The following changes can have a strong effect as well. - Becoming a student. - Becoming disabled. - Buying a home. - Changing employment. - Getting an inheritance. - Getting married.",

            "passage": "In this article, we discuss the top two child plans from LIC. We talk about their benefits and how they can be of use to you and your child. Take a look. Life Insurance Corporation of India, or LIC, as it is commonly known is one of the oldest and the most reputed life insurance companies in the country. It has some very good insurance products. The child insurance plans from LIC especially stand out as they have some of the best features. In this article, we take a look at the LIC child plans and their features and benefits. What is a child plan? Before we proceed, let us first understand what a child plan is. A child insurance plan provides protection to a child by covering his parent. The parent is, therefore, the policyholder and the child is the beneficiary. So if anything happens to the parent, the sum assured from the child plan will be given to the child and can be used for her or his education, health and general well-being. LIC child insurance plans\nThere are primarily two child plans available from LIC. They are:\n- LIC Child Future Plan\n- LIC Child Career Plan\nLet us take a detailed look at these plans. LIC Child Future Plan\nThe features of this LIC child plan are as follows:\n- Waiver of premium: The premium is waived off if the parent, who is the policyholder, dies within the policy period. The insurer pays the premium on behalf of the parent and the plan continues with its regular payouts. - Money back plan: This is a money back insurance plan where the child gets payouts at regular intervals. The payouts can be used to pay the child’s school and college admission fees and also to pay for her or his marriage later on in life. - Death benefit and sum assured: If the parent dies with policy period, the nominee receives a death benefit right away along with any bonus that has been earned. If however the policy period is outlived, an amount equivalent to 115% of the sum assured is paid to the child. - Additional cover: The child continues to stay covered for an added term of 7 years after the policy matures. These features make the LIC Child Future Plan one of the best child insurance plans in India presently. LIC Child Career Plan\nNext, we have the Child Career Plan from LIC. This too is a money back plan where the child receives payouts at pre-decided intervals. The features of this plan include:\n- Waiver of premium: Here too, the premium is waived off if the parent dies within the policy period. The child continues to remain covered however. He or she receives an additional coverage of 7 years after the policy matures. - Survival benefit: The LIC Child Career Plan provides a survival benefit. A sum equivalent to 30% of the sum assured is paid in this case. - Maturity benefit: When the policy matures, the child receives an additional amount, equivalent to 15% of the sum assured, along with the accumulated bonus. - High age bracket: The plan can be taken for children between the ages of 0 month and 12 years. The maturity age of the policy varies between 23 and 27 years. These are some of the features that make the LIC Child Career Plan stand out. To sum it up\nAs we saw, the LIC child plans are packed with benefits. As a parent, you must do everything within your power to protect your child. A child is a gift and the gift needs care. So buy a child plan from the Life Insurance Corporation of India and keep your precious child secured. After all, you would want him or her to enjoy a comfortable life even after you are gone.",

Plus, they will be able to use their card in shops, online and to withdraw cash. But don’t worry, you will get an instant notification whenever they use the card and can set weekly spending limits. 2. Rooster Money\nRooster Money will let you keep track of the total owed for things like pocket money or completed chores. One nice feature of this app is the ability to add pictures of items that kids are saving up for and set a savings target, which is great for helping your child to visualise the end goal. Children will also be able to see how much money they have saved and how they’ve spent it in an easy to read statement. The makers of iAllowance claim it’s had a role in getting over 20 million chores completed. This useful app will allow you to track the amount of allowance you owe to each child and virtually “prompt” them to finish tasks and chores linked to their pocket money earning potential! The information syncs across devices, and you can even email or print reports on how your child is doing. Gimi is designed to help you and your child keep track of their allowance and chores, but also to provide financial education along the way. A virtual piggy bank fills with the weekly allowance you set, and you can define rewards for specific tasks. But what’s most special about this app is there are three sets of lessons to learn, which you and your child can work through together. The lessons are currently themed around Earning, Saving and Spending and help to identify financial topics to discuss, and are accompanied by bright animated videos.

Jr. The main app for parents will allow you to set up a digital record of your child’s allowance and track how much they’ve earned and spent.

An index universal life insurance policy allows you to save for your child’s future with no market risk, deferred taxes, and no rules about what your child can or cannot do with the money. There are many benefits to this type of coverage. The policy has a living benefit, which you or your child can access at any time, as well as a death benefit that can be used to pay for funeral or other final expenses if your child passes away. You can earn interest on your money based on a fixed rate or an interest rate based on an equity or bond index. There is no market risk, meaning that you will earn interest when the market is up, but will not lose money when the market decreases. This allows you to earn more interest than you would in a regular savings account. The taxes on the interest are deferred until you begin to withdraw money from the policy. When you or your child access the cash value of the plan, you will not have to pay income tax on the money you withdraw from the policy. This coverage also has flexible benefits and premiums, so you can customize a plan to fit your family’s needs. Many people believe that a 529 plan is the only way to save for your child’s education, but you are penalized if your child chooses not to attend college. With index universal life insurance, your child can use the money for anything he or she chooses – there are no restrictions!

Call them at 970-879-0825, email email@example.com... or visit the Extension Office, 136 Sixth St.\nLast week, I took a couple hikes on some of the trails that have finally dried out from snowmelt. All along the Hinman Fisherman’s Trail was one of my favorite early season flowers, the Glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). This exquisite and delicate small flower features curved yellow petals with stamens that protrude from the flower’s center. The leafless stems are 6 to 12 inches long and bend at the top giving the flower an elegant drooping profile.\nAlso called dogtooth violet and snow lily, glacier lilies provide early season food for much wildlife in our area, including bears, deer and elk who eat the corms (the swollen underground part of the stem that stores energy for next year — not quite a bulb, but close) and green seed pods, as will sheep and cattle. Ground squirrels and other rodents dig up the corms and store them for winter consumption.\nAlthough it is a really pretty flower that would look great in a meadow or garden, it generally should not be dug up from its habitats in the wild as it sends its corms deep into the soil. Most of us would end up digging up only the leaves and their stems, killing the pretty plant.\nIt’s an edible plant, as well as a spring beauty. The corm is edible raw but tastier and easier to digest when cooked. The stems and leaves of glacier lilies are also edible, although less nutritious than the corms, and can sometimes be found adding a touch of color and texture to salad greens. The seedpod, which forms after the flower bloom has ended, is also edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. It tastes a little like green beans. As with any of these wild edible plants, it’s best to eat in moderation to avoid upsetting your stomach.\nLater in the week, I hiked the Sarvis Creek trail in the southern part of the county and was enchanted by all the Mountain Bluebells (Mertensia ciliata ) in bloom along the way. A member of the Boraginaceae (forget- me-not or borage) family, this widely dispersed perennial features a four-foot tall, three-foot wide plant with blue-green leaves that feature fine hairs (hence the name ciliata) and small, bell-shaped flower clusters that start out light blue and become pinkish purple as the flower ages. It’s usually found in wet meadows and along stream banks throughout the western U.S. and is sometimes found as a single plant but often as a whole colony along a stream or wet meadow. It’s an aromatic and beautiful early season flower.\nThe bell-shaped flowers are edible, as are the leaves, but the leaves aren’t very palatable raw with their hairy coating. Native Americans had medicinal uses for this plant.\nAs the weather turns nice, be sure to get out and see all the early-season wildflowers our part of the mountains feature during this short blooming season.\nDeb Babcock is a volunteer Master Gardener through the CSU Extension Routt County.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Steamboat and Routt County make the Steamboat Pilot & Today’s work possible.

The stems and leaves are also edible but less nutritious than the corms, and can be added to salad greens. The seedpod, which appears after flowering, can be eaten raw or cooked and tastes similar to green beans. However, these wild edibles should be eaten in moderation to avoid stomach upset.",
    "answer": "The Glacier lily, also known as Erythronium grandiflorum, is native to North America and its edible parts primarily include the bulbs and leaves. The bulbs, when cooked, can have a taste that's often compared to a combination of potato and onion, with a slight sweetness. The leaves can also be eaten when young, and they have a mild, somewhat nutty flavor.\n\nBefore consuming any part of the Glacier lily, it's important to properly identify the plant and ensure it hasn't been treated with chemicals. Always cook the bulbs thoroughly before eating, as raw bulbs may cause digestive upset. As with all wild-foraged foods, moderation is key when trying new edible plants like the Glacier lily.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: The ubiquitous orange daylily. Seen in almost every farm house's yard where I grew up. They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms. I love having useful plants in the yard. How about you? per the Peterson Field Guide - Edible Wild Plants:\nOn identifying the edible day-lily \"Note the unspotted tawny blossoms (open 1 day only) facing upward from the top of a leafless flowerstalk. Basal leaves light green, long, swordlike. Root a tangle of small elongated tubers.\"\n\nCarnation petals has been long used to make liqueur called Chartreuse by monks in the early 18th century. If you want to add a perfumed touch to your salad, then toss a few petals of carnations and enliven the appearance. The petals can also be chopped and used with other herbs to be eaten along with meats. Image Credit: cbsally\nA Chicory plant sports flowers of lavender or blue color.

How to eat Dill\nThe tall and tiny yellow umbels of Dill flowers are used when cooking meats and fish.

They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms.

    "question": "How did Nat King Cole's musical career evolve in the 1940s?\n",
    "gold": "Nat King Cole, born in March 1919, began as a rhythm and blues performer with a trickster's manner. He successfully crossed over to appeal to white audiences with his 1943 song 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' and further strengthened this connection with 'The Christmas Song' in 1946.\n",
    "answer": "In the 1940s, Nat King Cole's musical career evolved significantly. He began the decade as a part of the jazz scene, forming the Nat King Cole Trio with Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. The trio, which became one of the first successful jazz trios, played instrumental jazz and gradually introduced vocals to their music. \n\nIn December 1940, Cole recorded his hit song \"Sweet Lorraine,\" which helped increase the trio's popularity. The band's success opened doors for many other small jazz groups. Cole's work with the trio during this period was heavily influenced by jazz pianist Earl Hines, whom he greatly admired.\n\nBy the late 1940s, Nat King Cole started transitioning from jazz to a more popular style, performing more pop-oriented material and often accompanied by a string orchestra. This shift in musical focus marked a significant change in his career and led to hits like \"The Christmas Song,\" \"Nature Boy,\" \"Mona Lisa,\" and \"Too Young.\"\n\nDespite criticism from some jazz purists who felt he was \"selling out\" by moving away from pure jazz, Cole's popularity continued to grow. His ability to blend jazz with popular music made him a unique artist, appealing to a wider audience and earning him a place among the crooners of his time, alongside Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. \n\nIn 1948, Cole's personal life also saw change with his marriage to Maria Ellington, who encouraged him to move further away from jazz. His marriage and the success of \"The Christmas Song\" marked a turning point in his career, leading him toward the smooth, polished sound that would define his later years.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, Nat King Cole's career evolved from a pioneering figure in jazz to a celebrated pop singer, shaping his lasting legacy in American music.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nWednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).\n\nHis revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]\n\nSunday marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of the American jazz pianist and vocalist, Nat King Cole (1919-1965). In 1937, Nat King Cole’s jazz trio was formed in Los Angeles. In the group’s original lineup, Cole was joined by Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. The trio influenced younger jazz musicians like Oscar Peterson and John Pizzarelli. Around the late 1940s, Cole transitioned to a more popular style, appearing frequently in film and on television, and taking his place alongside crooners like Frank Sinatra. He was the first African American man to host an American television series. Nat King Cole did not escape the racial tensions of the waning days of the Jim Crow era. In 1956, he was assaulted onstage by members of the Ku Klux Klan during a concert in Birmingham, Alabama. At the same time, members of the NAACP attacked him for acquiescing to the system by continuing to perform for segregated audiences. Yet Cole was an active participant in the civil rights movement, contributing money to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and helping to plan the 1963 March on Washington. Here is the Nat King Cole Trio performing “It’s Better To Be By Yourself” and “Solid Potato Salad” in 1946:\n“Unforgettable,” written by Irving Gordon, was released in 1951:\n\nThe trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles in 1930s, he formed a group with a slight variation on his name. Soon, the Nat King Cole Trio was playing all over LA, and the man was making a name for himself. In 1943, the group was signed to Capitol Records. He was the first to top a guitarist and bassist with his piano to form a trio, and soon that would be considered the norm for Jazz trios. While this song was not his first hit, \"Too Young\" was certainly one fo the biggest for him, spending five weeks at #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song, written by Sidney Lippman, the lyrics by Sylvia Dee, was recorded by many, including Donny Osmond in 1972. But no one could match the success with the song that Nat King Cole did in 1951. With the top-selling song of the year, here is Nat King Cole singing \"Too Young\". Have a great weekend!\n\nAs both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole\n\nI never can say goodbye, Isaac Hayes\nAn interview on Conan\nISAAC HAYES, August 20, 1942 – August 10, 2008\nThe material in this space:\n- Articles minus a journalist\n- Memory lane material\n- A blog\n- Online services for artists\nI never can say goodbye, Isaac Hayes\nAn interview on Conan\nLead singer of The Main Ingredient, Cuba Gooding Sr, was born in Harlem and moved to California as an adult.

And we all know that we can't quite know what that would have been.\n\nDF: Well, the blues underlies jazz as a whole, I think. I really got interested in listening to jazz. My brother Mort had a wonderful jazz collection (he’s seven years older than I), and he was moving out of the house about the time I was getting into the piano. He showed me how to play the blues, how it was constructed. So I understood those principles of the I chord and the V chord. Mort was a pianist. Both older brothers played popular piano. They could play dominant sevenths, although they didn’t know that was what they were called. I could play the blues in any key, but I never ventured into the black keys a lot. I wanted to play just like Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson was the guy that I really thought was great. I didn’t start getting into other repertoire until I was well into high school. My brothers’ record collections with Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman were big influences. RV: Did your parents encourage your interest in music? DF: My parents were bewildered. When they heard me start to play bebop, they really thought I’d gone crazy. My Dad always impressed on me that music was a great thing to do for a hobby, but you gotta do something else to make a living. I subscribed to that in kind of a passive way. I knew I could play and I knew that’s what I wanted to do. I was most interested in classic jazz. I read Mezz Mezzrow’s book, Really the Blues. It was a book from the 1940s about the romance of being a jazz musician. When I met Marian McPartland decades later, she said that was the book that caught her attention and got her interested in jazz when she was living in England before she came over here. RV: Was there a specific teacher who inspired your growing musicianship? DF: I worked part time at the Columbia distribution center in those days. I met a guy Jimmy Mulcrone, a pianist who was working with me packaging records. At that time you could walk in to the department store and record an acetate record. I had a few of these I’d recorded playing boogie-woogie piano with my brother Mort singing like Joe Turner. I played our records for Jimmy and he said, “You can play, but I could show you some stuff.” I began to go to his house in northeast Minneapolis on Saturdays, a long streetcar ride for me. He taught me music theory in my middle teens, assigning me pop songs to learn. I caught on quickly and it all made sense to me, almost immediately. Then, he taught me how bebop musicians manipulated harmony. That’s what got me interested in contemporary jazz. That’s when I decided I wanted to be a bebopper. That’s when I began playing with other musicians. RV: It’s good to remember the moments and people that changed our lives. Who were you listening to at that juncture of enlightenment? DF: Up to that point, I liked Jelly Roll Morton, Teddy Wilson, Mel Powell, Art Tatum. I liked the two-fisted piano players. They were big stars. Nat Cole hit me hard; I was listening to his piano playing. RV: Oh yes, Nat was such a big influence in so many ways. The pianist \/ singer, Ray Sullenger, who nurtured my knowledge in Houston years back, sang in the Nat Cole \/ Mel Torme tradition. I always admired their understated brilliance. DF: Jimmy Mulcrone also introduced me to Bud Powell and Al Haig’s playing. I started playing with cats in high school ensembles and knew it was what I really wanted to do. We had combos and I started playing gigs. Usually the leader was a kid my age and would provide the arrangements. We copied songs off bebop records and made simple arrangements of pop songs. RV: What was the music of the day in your high school years? DF: Well, first it was the King Cole Trio, then he started calling himself Nat King Cole. It was the pop music of the day. On the radio in Minneapolis there was really good jazz programming two or three times a week. I got to hear Charlie Ventura and Jackie and Roy. I saw Charlie Parker play on the University of Minnesota campus and it knocked me out. He was big giant.\n\nThe Coles were wed in Harlem on Easter Sunday in 1948, just six days after Nat's divorce from his first wife became final, and were married for almost 17 years. The soft-spoken singer of such classics as \"Unforgettable,\" \"Nature Boy,\" \"Too Young\" and “Mona Lisa” died of lung cancer in Santa Monica in February 1965. \"Our mom was in a class all by herself,\" Natalie said in a statement released with her twin sisters Timolin and Casey Cole. \"She epitomized class and elegance and truly defined what it is to be a real lady. We are so blessed and privileged to have inherited the legacy that she leaves behind along with our father. \"She died how she lived: with great strength, courage and dignity, surrounded by her loving family.\" Born in Boston in 1922, Maria Cole and a sister moved to North Carolina to live with an aunt soon after her mother died in childbirth. She took voice and piano lessons as a child, and after graduating in 1938 from the Palmer Memorial Institute -- then one of America’s most prestigious African-American prep schools -- she returned to Boston and sang with a jazz orchestra. She soon moved to New York to pursue a music career with jazz great Benny Carter’s band. In 1943, she married Spurgeon Ellington, a Tuskegee Airmen flyer during World War II. He was killed in Georgia two years later during a routine postwar training flight. After performing briefly with Count Basie and swing music innovator Fletcher Henderson, Cole's big break came when Ellington hired her as a vocalist. She stayed with him until 1946, when she began soloing at New York's Club Zanzibar as an opening act for The Mills Brothers. It was there that she met Nat\nand they was married in 1948 in a lavish ceremony in Harlem. The couple traveled throughout Europe in the 1950s, and Maria recorded several songs with her husband for Capitol Records and sang at top venues in California and on the East Coast. Natalie, a nine-time Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, was born in 1950 as the Coles' first child. She was followed by the late Nat Kelly Cole, adopted in 1959, and the twins Timolin and Casey, who were born in 1961. In 1949, the couple had adopted Carol (known as \"Cookie\"), the daughter of Maria’s late sister. After her husband’s death, Maria produced a James Baldwin play, sang on The Ed Sullivan Show, created the Cole Cancer Foundation and was active in charity work. In 1987, she was interviewed by Natalie and singer Johnny Mathis for a PBS special on Nat. In 1990, Maria and Natalie accepted a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for her late husband. In addition to her three daughters, survivors include her sister, Charlotte; her son-in-laws Gary and Julian; and six grandchildren.

            "passage": "Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.",

His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).",

            "passage": "His revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]",

In 1937, Nat King Cole’s jazz trio was formed in Los Angeles. In the group’s original lineup, Cole was joined by Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. The trio influenced younger jazz musicians like Oscar Peterson and John Pizzarelli. Around the late 1940s, Cole transitioned to a more popular style, appearing frequently in film and on television, and taking his place alongside crooners like Frank Sinatra. He was the first African American man to host an American television series. Nat King Cole did not escape the racial tensions of the waning days of the Jim Crow era. In 1956, he was assaulted onstage by members of the Ku Klux Klan during a concert in Birmingham, Alabama. At the same time, members of the NAACP attacked him for acquiescing to the system by continuing to perform for segregated audiences. Yet Cole was an active participant in the civil rights movement, contributing money to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and helping to plan the 1963 March on Washington. Here is the Nat King Cole Trio performing “It’s Better To Be By Yourself” and “Solid Potato Salad” in 1946:\n“Unforgettable,” written by Irving Gordon, was released in 1951:",

            "passage": "The trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.",

Soon, the Nat King Cole Trio was playing all over LA, and the man was making a name for himself. In 1943, the group was signed to Capitol Records. He was the first to top a guitarist and bassist with his piano to form a trio, and soon that would be considered the norm for Jazz trios. While this song was not his first hit, \"Too Young\" was certainly one fo the biggest for him, spending five weeks at #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song, written by Sidney Lippman, the lyrics by Sylvia Dee, was recorded by many, including Donny Osmond in 1972. But no one could match the success with the song that Nat King Cole did in 1951.

Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole",

Anyone can complicate things. These days anyone can distort and fake things.

            "passage": "DF: Well, the blues underlies jazz as a whole, I think. I really got interested in listening to jazz. My brother Mort had a wonderful jazz collection (he’s seven years older than I), and he was moving out of the house about the time I was getting into the piano. He showed me how to play the blues, how it was constructed. So I understood those principles of the I chord and the V chord. Mort was a pianist. Both older brothers played popular piano. They could play dominant sevenths, although they didn’t know that was what they were called. I could play the blues in any key, but I never ventured into the black keys a lot. I wanted to play just like Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson was the guy that I really thought was great. I didn’t start getting into other repertoire until I was well into high school. My brothers’ record collections with Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman were big influences. RV: Did your parents encourage your interest in music? DF: My parents were bewildered. When they heard me start to play bebop, they really thought I’d gone crazy. My Dad always impressed on me that music was a great thing to do for a hobby, but you gotta do something else to make a living. I subscribed to that in kind of a passive way. I knew I could play and I knew that’s what I wanted to do. I was most interested in classic jazz. I read Mezz Mezzrow’s book, Really the Blues. It was a book from the 1940s about the romance of being a jazz musician. When I met Marian McPartland decades later, she said that was the book that caught her attention and got her interested in jazz when she was living in England before she came over here. RV: Was there a specific teacher who inspired your growing musicianship? DF: I worked part time at the Columbia distribution center in those days. I met a guy Jimmy Mulcrone, a pianist who was working with me packaging records. At that time you could walk in to the department store and record an acetate record. I had a few of these I’d recorded playing boogie-woogie piano with my brother Mort singing like Joe Turner. I played our records for Jimmy and he said, “You can play, but I could show you some stuff.” I began to go to his house in northeast Minneapolis on Saturdays, a long streetcar ride for me. He taught me music theory in my middle teens, assigning me pop songs to learn. I caught on quickly and it all made sense to me, almost immediately. Then, he taught me how bebop musicians manipulated harmony. That’s what got me interested in contemporary jazz. That’s when I decided I wanted to be a bebopper. That’s when I began playing with other musicians. RV: It’s good to remember the moments and people that changed our lives. Who were you listening to at that juncture of enlightenment? DF: Up to that point, I liked Jelly Roll Morton, Teddy Wilson, Mel Powell, Art Tatum. I liked the two-fisted piano players. They were big stars. Nat Cole hit me hard; I was listening to his piano playing. RV: Oh yes, Nat was such a big influence in so many ways. The pianist \/ singer, Ray Sullenger, who nurtured my knowledge in Houston years back, sang in the Nat Cole \/ Mel Torme tradition. I always admired their understated brilliance. DF: Jimmy Mulcrone also introduced me to Bud Powell and Al Haig’s playing. I started playing with cats in high school ensembles and knew it was what I really wanted to do. We had combos and I started playing gigs. Usually the leader was a kid my age and would provide the arrangements. We copied songs off bebop records and made simple arrangements of pop songs. RV: What was the music of the day in your high school years? DF: Well, first it was the King Cole Trio, then he started calling himself Nat King Cole. It was the pop music of the day. On the radio in Minneapolis there was really good jazz programming two or three times a week. I got to hear Charlie Ventura and Jackie and Roy. I saw Charlie Parker play on the University of Minnesota campus and it knocked me out. He was big giant.",

The soft-spoken singer of such classics as \"Unforgettable,\" \"Nature Boy,\" \"Too Young\" and “Mona Lisa” died of lung cancer in Santa Monica in February 1965. \"Our mom was in a class all by herself,\" Natalie said in a statement released with her twin sisters Timolin and Casey Cole. \"She epitomized class and elegance and truly defined what it is to be a real lady. We are so blessed and privileged to have inherited the legacy that she leaves behind along with our father. \"She died how she lived: with great strength, courage and dignity, surrounded by her loving family.\" Born in Boston in 1922, Maria Cole and a sister moved to North Carolina to live with an aunt soon after her mother died in childbirth. She took voice and piano lessons as a child, and after graduating in 1938 from the Palmer Memorial Institute -- then one of America’s most prestigious African-American prep schools -- she returned to Boston and sang with a jazz orchestra. She soon moved to New York to pursue a music career with jazz great Benny Carter’s band. In 1943, she married Spurgeon Ellington, a Tuskegee Airmen flyer during World War II. He was killed in Georgia two years later during a routine postwar training flight. After performing briefly with Count Basie and swing music innovator Fletcher Henderson, Cole's big break came when Ellington hired her as a vocalist. She stayed with him until 1946, when she began soloing at New York's Club Zanzibar as an opening act for The Mills Brothers. It was there that she met Nat\nand they was married in 1948 in a lavish ceremony in Harlem. The couple traveled throughout Europe in the 1950s, and Maria recorded several songs with her husband for Capitol Records and sang at top venues in California and on the East Coast. Natalie, a nine-time Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, was born in 1950 as the Coles' first child. She was followed by the late Nat Kelly Cole, adopted in 1959, and the twins Timolin and Casey, who were born in 1961. In 1949, the couple had adopted Carol (known as \"Cookie\"), the daughter of Maria’s late sister. After her husband’s death, Maria produced a James Baldwin play, sang on The Ed Sullivan Show, created the Cole Cancer Foundation and was active in charity work. In 1987, she was interviewed by Natalie and singer Johnny Mathis for a PBS special on Nat. In 1990, Maria and Natalie accepted a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for her late husband. In addition to her three daughters, survivors include her sister, Charlotte; her son-in-laws Gary and Julian; and six grandchildren.

Published by Miramax Books, “Bling” tells the story of a young, innocent mixed-race woman trying to break into the music business. A gifted singer, she is remade in flashy style by a rapacious record mogul.",

They shared with us what they have been learning in music. The interaction and teaching with our students was a highlight. They encouraged students to learn music and shared their enthusiasm for playing and performing. We even learnt a little bit about conducting!

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.\n\n\"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\" Our Music Department is founded on the belief that all students are musicians, they just need to find their musical voice, whether it is through singing or an instrument, composing their own music, exploring elements of music technology or sharing their own interpretations of the music they hear.Our curriculum covers a range of skills and styles, providing the opportunity for the less-experienced to discover what music really is, while still challenging those who have been studying an instrument for many years. All topics include some elements of listening, performing and composing, and all students are expected to be familiar with basic music notation by the end of Year 5. The majority of learning is done through practical tasks as the more explicit, intensive study of music history and theory can be found in the exam years. We encourage all students to remember that being ‘musical’ is not simply about learning an instrument. It involves a range of skills that can be developed through regular practice. - Early Years and Pre-Prep\n- Senior School\n- Sixth Form\n- Outside the Classroom\n- Individual Instrumental and Singing Lessons\nStudents engage in music learning from the very beginning of their Harrow journey. The first steps involve a variety of games to develop their co-ordination skills and engage their imaginations. As their journey progresses they are introduced to a variety of instruments and have the opportunity to explore different sounds. This continues as they progress through Pre-Prep, with increasing levels of musical vocabulary and the introduction of music notation. Students develop greater independence through their time in Prep, with an increasing emphasis on group work and research-influenced performing and composing. Students also have the opportunity to work with instrumental teachers during this time, for example through group lessons of guitars and wind instruments in Year 8. Students in Prep use an increasing amount of technology, particularly Garageband, to widen their skill base. Students in Year 9 continue to develop their understanding through group work and class discussion, using more complex vocabulary and making more complex connections between pieces and styles. They also learn to use Sibelius software at this stage.In Years 10 and 11, the CIE GCSE course is equipped to develop the musical skills of each student, with the final result being derived from coursework (30% performing and 30% composing) and a general listening exam (40%). The CIE AS\/A2 course combines musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, composing, performing as well as looking at music and musicians from a wider context. Students study a selection of contrasting set works from the Classical Period as well as a topic of ‘Picturing Music’. They also have options regarding the amount of performing and composing they do, opening the A-level to a wider range of students. At A2, students do not take a final exam. They may choose either a performing or composing option, along with an investigative report. We offer a wide ranging extra-curricular music programme, both during Enrichment Activity slots and also lunchtimes. Students of all ages and abilities can find something to engage their musical skills. These feed into the whole school concerts, which take place at Christmas and in the late spring. Students are also encouraged and supported in setting up their own ensembles and have many opportunities to demonstrate their skills throughout the year. As a member of FOBISIA, we have taken part in a number of their festivals, including the Primary Carnival, and acting as hosts for the older students’ Music Festival. Our older students also perform in the wider community, particularly at Christmas where they have become a fixture at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Christmas celebrations. - Pre-Prep Singers (Years 2-5)\n- Show Choir (Years 6-13)\n- Apri Canentes (Years 10-13 audition only)\n- Staff Choir\n- String Group\n- Chinese Drumming\n- Flute Choir (lunchtime activity)\n- Guitar Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Reed Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Ukulele Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Pre-Prep Pans (lunchtime activity)\n- Steelers (Year 6 – 9, beginner to intermediate steel pans)\n- Pantastic (Years 7 – 13 advanced steel pans)\nWe also offer individual 30 minute lessons on a wide variety of instruments. Our team of instrumental teachers are very experienced.\n\nSteelband music in schools is now an integral part of the steelpan culture throughout the United Kingdom (UK). This section aims to support some of the many UK steelbands that have contributed to music education and many other aspects of their band member's educational development by playing steelpans. Each feature is unique in its own way, illustrating the different reasons why the steelbands were formed and how they are run. However, some common themes that are highlighted in each feature are:\n- Encouraging pupils to work independently or in a group. - Sharing experiences and presenting basic skills to others. - Gaining opportunities to engage in cultural events. - Exploring music and its role within society as a possible career. The features will hopefully encourage those wanting to start a steelband and newly developing steelbands to take a closer look at the various achievements accomplished, and to implement elements that may enhance their own projects. If you have a steelband and would like to share your experiences, please email your details\n\nYear 7 and 8\nLearning Music in our College 'makes the difference'\nAll Year 7 students participate in 'Classroom Music—Training Band' program where all students are provided (for one year) a concert style instrument for the Band class. They perform and study various musical styles and basic playing techniques. This subject is not a substitute for learning or studying a major musical instrument of student own choice within our Instrumental Music Program. Technical skills that are covered are very basic and classes involve general classroom music themes, too. All students are required to perform at the end of year concert as part of their major assessment. All students are welcome to join any of the major ensembles that Instrumental Music students enjoy! INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PROGRAM offers an ensemble-based instrumental music program. All music students involved with our teachers must participate in at least one of our established ensembles - Beginner Band, Concert Band, Symphonic Band, or Junior and Senior Stage Band; or, for our string players, String Orchestra or Junior String Ensemble or, for our vocalists, pianists, Senior and Junior Chorale and Concert Chorale. Chamber type or smaller ensembles such as Flutes and Drums Ensemble, Octetata are created over the year for advanced players, but all students must belong to one of the larger ensembles. This is all part of the instrumental music lessons paid for by our parents. Many concerts are held throughout the year. As a result of participating in the ensemble based program students are provided tuition on their instrument in either group or individual lessons with trained, highly qualified music staff. Instrumental Music Program is an extra-curricular program with rehearsals outside of school hours, and instrumental lessons and ensembles operating both in and outside of normal school timetable. It is integrated in a learning capacity with the Year 7 and 8 Classroom Music Program but it is considered as extension and enrichment. It is considered developmental learning particularly if students wish to continue on to VCE. Each student will complete major music exams (August \/ October) run by the music department providing the student with knowledge about the grade achieved, level attained, and skills demonstrated. They learn specific music skills, study technical works, scales, ensemble development, music expression, general knowledge and use the pedagogy or language of music to develop their communication skills. Our music department teachers offer support and encouragement to our students to enroll in AMEB, Trinity, ABRSM examinations over the course of the year, or students may be expected to compete in Eisteddfods and music competitions, all of which are exciting to perform in and are great levelers at establishing true benchmarks for measuring student musical achievements. The student is encouraged to set high personal goals in performance and we provide reports on how the student has gone about achieving those personal goals. Our aim is to provide a broad musical base whereby a student may have lots of musical involvement, learning and socialisation, and can draw upon a wide range of experiences from their participation and involvement within the Instrumental Music Program.

The day showed us how each individual band member contributes to the orchestra and creates a larger sound. When we first arrived at the Adelaide Town Hall, we met the Concertmaster and the Conductor. They told us several interesting facts about the orchestra and their positions within it. We were then given a chance to ask some questions. Once we were seated in the Grand Hall, we watched the orchestra setup, tune and start rehearsal. By watching the orchestra, we were exposed to the environment and level of professionalism commonly found within professional orchestras. A highlight of the day was listening to the pianist, Konstantin Shamray, play Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No 1: 2nd Movement along with the orchestra. This was a truly unique and memorable experience that showed us one of the many opportunities that are available in music. Muhammad Faraz Mangi & Caiden Randolph\nYear 9 Music Focus Class\n\nDirector of Music\nWalk My Way, an event organised by Australian Lutheran World Service, was held on Saturday, 13 April. A total of 17 Concordia Campus students participated in this 26-kilometre walk and contributed to the almost $5,000 raised by Concordia to help children attend school in the Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya. Many staff members from both campuses also participated in the walk; while a few Year 12 Media students helped film the event. “This experience was eye-opening and moving as we walked from Hahndorf to Beaumont on the Pioneer Women’s Trail. On this journey, we were able to witness a small glimpse of what refugees face on a daily basis in the attempt to find safety. I think that this small journey has given me a better and wider understanding of the struggle that those who have no choice but to flee their home face and how significant that action is. I hope that by my actions, I have been able to help a child, who has taken a longer and more difficult journey, to have a brighter and better future” – Asha 10JLEY. “What do you think when you hear that we completed half a marathon of walking in one day? Well we managed to! Doing Walk my Way was an incredible experience. As soon as we arrived, we got a fantastic welcome and a cool hand-made bag filled with medical supplies along with a vibrant blue t-shirt! A huge crowd gathered for breakfast which was generously supplied by local businesses and the local church. We then went to a formal service where the Mayor of Mt Barker spoke as well as other distinguished guests. Once we began walking, we found out that this was a very long walk, but as it turns out we got used to it. Our friendship group ended up coping by singing karaoke songs the whole time. When we saw the bright orange cones at the end, we were overjoyed. This was such a fun challenge and for such a brilliant cause. We had just walked 26km!” – Tahlia 8MRID and Alicia 8MRID. Late last term, the Music Department was blessed to host Indigenous musician and World Vision ambassador Scott Darlow. Not only were the Music students from Years 8 to 11 blessed to hear Scott perform some of his wonderful music, they were also privileged to have the opportunity to listen to Scott speak candidly and honestly about his own personal journey as an Indigenous man living in Australia as well as touring the world as a musician. His message was powerful, at times confronting, but most importantly it was inspirational. We sincerely hope to have Scott back in the near future. Director of Music\nAn exciting part of our Pastoral Care program in Term 1 was the Year 8 Camp at Adare Campsite, Victor Harbor. We were very fortunate to be able to take GoPros with us on the camp experience so that we could film some of the treasured moments and challenges conquered, not to mention some of the hilarity and camaraderie among the Year 8 ‘tribe’ groups. On return to the College we held a competition in Year 8 to determine the favourite tribe video, as judged by Mr Weinert and the Year 8 Home Class teachers. Sophie and Lian from 8AMAR were the esteemed winners of the tribe video competition. Congratulations Sophie and Lian! Year 8 students also cemented their learning by creating posters for Murtoa which included camp photos and the IB Learner Profile aspects that were most enhanced by their Year 8 Camp experience. Again, Mr Weinert was our guest judge to determine the most successful IB Learner Profile posters. Our winners were:\nCongratulations Year 8s! Thank you to Mr Weinert for his involvement and support of our learning in Year 8. Year 8 Pastoral Leader\nThanks go to the Year 9 Special Interest Music class who performed for guests at the final Principal’s Tour for Term 1. After playing for the regular Chapel service, students stayed on to provide musical entertainment for a large group of families eager to see the opportunities open to their children, should they attend Concordia College. The Chapel Sessions\nIn preparation for our tour to Mount Gambier for Generations in Jazz 2019, each ensemble performed at The Chapel Sessions. This gave the students an opportunity to play for their family and friends, allowing these guests to hear the music prepared for this year’s Jazz Festival. Director of Music\nIn week 11 last term, 8VNAR interviewed the Year 3 cohort as part of our ‘Telling our Stories’ English unit. We asked thought-provoking questions about our buddies and their experience with the learner profile. The answers we collected helped us find out more about our buddy’s story.\n\nWhen she was very young, Lorrine took formal music lessons and she is glad to continue this learning journey as she loves music. She says, “Music is now an important part of my life, like a daily meal with vitamin M – for MUSIC.” Lorrine is diligent with her music practices as she believes an active brain can prevent dementia. With a good and patient teacher, every lesson is time well spent with teacher Maria. Twelve-year-old Chow Wern is from the Advanced Ensemble Course at YMS Tampines. His mother, Mrs. Chow has this to share:\nChow Wern started his musical journey in Yamaha's Music Wonderland where he learned to appreciate and make music with his friends. He enjoyed it very much and has continued with Yamaha's group courses since. He is now in the second year of the Advanced Ensemble Course. Learning and playing music in a group makes it livelier and more interesting. Chow Wern and his course mates are able to learn from each other and being in a group also motivates him to practice more. As he said, \"I like the Yamaha group courses. I love learning and playing music in a group. Not only that, I get to bond with my course mates and be long time buddies.\" I also like that the group courses exposed him to ensemble playing. He enjoys it that each person has a different part to play and all have to listen to each other's parts and come together to play a good piece. He likes ensemble playing very much that it inspired him to join Chinese Orchestra in school and learn a new instrument, Sheng. The courses also exposed him to create and write his own music. This has encouraged him to explore musical ideas and write his own compositions. With the help of his teacher in improving his compositions, he is fortunate to have his works selected to perform in the school Yamaha Junior Original Concert twice. Performing in this Concert also gave him a chance to see the other students' compositions and inspired him to try to create more pieces. In his words, Chow Wern feels that \"the courses have benefited me as I have learned the basics of music and now I'm learning the more advanced side of it. The courses have helped developed my musical aptitude and abilities. I'm truly lucky to learn and love music in an encouraging and happy environment.\" His younger sister, Chow Huey has also started her musical experience with Yamaha. She is now in the 3rd year of the Yamaha Junior Course and enjoys her lessons tremendously. I am glad that both of them are enjoying their music lessons and hope that it's a skill that they will learn and keep, and make music a part of their lives. Nine-year-old Matthew Yap is a first year student of Junior Ensemble Course (JNC) at YMS Plaza Singapura. His mother, Ms. Lim Mei Yih has this to say about the learning experience of Matthew:\nMy hubby and I have no regrets signing Matthew up for the Yamaha Junior course. The course not only emphasizes teaching the children to play on the keyboard, but it also trains them in abilities to listen, sing solfege and respond rhythmically. Matthew is always looking forward to his class and he enjoys learning music with a group of his friends. They have a lot of fun during and after the lessons. He is motivated by the exposure to different genres of music and was excited that he had a chance to perform in Junior Original Concert at the school. The performance at the concert has given Matthew a valuable experience. It gave his confidence a boost, and he is looking forward to another opportunity in the near future. Samantha Kunafi is 9 years old, and in her first year of Junior Ensemble Course (JNC) at YMS Plaza Singapura. Her Mum, Susan Purnomo says:\nOne of Yamaha's unique strong point is, the exposure to creativity in the music lessons. They are taught and encouraged to compose their own melody and thereafter play with variations. Unlike private piano lessons, Yamaha group class is very interactive and fun. The songs in the curriculum are catchy and able to pique the interest of the children. When Samantha completed the 4th year of Yamaha Junior Course, she was given an opportunity to present her composition at the Junior Original Concert at the school. In preparation for this performance, Samantha was motivated to play expressively and her confidence was given a boost. Samantha is now in JNC and I can see further development in Samantha's interest in music. I do see her trying to play pieces out of her textbook curriculum. She really enjoys going to her weekly Yamaha music lessons. Eleven-year-old Yeo Yu Ann is a first year student of Advanced Ensemble Course (ANC) at YMS Tampines.\n\nI would teach children music, physics and philosophy: but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning. (Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods. Music complements the vision and core values of Greengate Lane Academy. Our belief is that the Greengate Lane school values are weaved throughout our curriculum to support our pupils and our school community, our Music lessons are structured as follows:\n- SCHOLARSHIP: our music curriculum allows our children to be scholarly, they are taught the subject in depth, progressively building on prior knowledge, resulting in children remembering more and being able to articulate what that have learnt. - CURIOUSITY: music lessons encourage pupils to contribute through discussion and collaboration; pupils reflect on their own ideas and those of others, they are encouraged to ask questions and be curious. - TENACITY: the music curriculum encourages pupil to overcome challenges and learn about how to continually improve on their musical compositions based off of the opinions and advice of their peers. - ASPIRATIONAL: pupils are given the opportunity to perform their compositions to the rest of the school and at whole school events, which they will work on to perfect for extended periods of time\n- KINDNESS: lessons are structured so that children learn skills together and support each other in partner work. Our curriculum drivers (vocabulary acquisition, SMSC, cultural awareness) are at the heart of all our music lessons:\nVOCABULARY ACQUSITION: children are continually introduced to new, subject specific vocabulary which they are encouraged to use regularly. SMSC: children are introduced to many different musical genres and encouraged to appraise these, forming opinions on what they like, dislike and appreciate the composition and creativity of the music they are surrounded by. CUTLURAL AWARENESS: as part of the music curriculum, children are introduced to music from a variety of different cultures and time periods, whilst being encouraged to analyse the similarities and differences these have from each other. At Greengate Lane Academy, we teach music through the Charanga scheme. The scheme provides teachers with carefully sequenced week-by-week lessons for each year group in the school, from ages 5–11. It has lesson plans, assessment, clear progression, and engaging and exciting whiteboard resources for every lesson. The Scheme supports all the requirements of the national curriculum and is in line with published Ofsted guidance. In EYFS children will focus on:\n- Listening and Responding\n- Exploring and Creating Singing\n- Sharing and Performing\nIn Key Stage 1 and 2 children will focus on:\n- Listening and appraising\n- Musical activities (games, singing, playing instruments, improvisation, composition)\n- Performing and Sharing\nThese are taught across the school; learning deepens and broadens in each year group. Lessons are delivered by class teachers to their own classes each week in order to teach the required knowledge and skills in a developmental and age-appropriate way. In addition to this, in Year 4\/5 the children have the opportunity to learn Samba Drumming with a specialist teacher. Impact of the Curriculum\nIn music, teachers assess pupils’ learning in lessons and adapt their teaching to be responsive to pupils understanding. As the curriculum progresses it is increasingly more challenging and pupils have the opportunity to review and extend their understanding over time as well as combine and apply different aspects of knowledge an skills development.\n\nQuestion:What was the educational purpose behind the Endeavour College Year 9 band sharing their musical learning experience?",

We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.",

            "passage": "\"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\" Our Music Department is founded on the belief that all students are musicians, they just need to find their musical voice, whether it is through singing or an instrument, composing their own music, exploring elements of music technology or sharing their own interpretations of the music they hear.Our curriculum covers a range of skills and styles, providing the opportunity for the less-experienced to discover what music really is, while still challenging those who have been studying an instrument for many years. All topics include some elements of listening, performing and composing, and all students are expected to be familiar with basic music notation by the end of Year 5. The majority of learning is done through practical tasks as the more explicit, intensive study of music history and theory can be found in the exam years. We encourage all students to remember that being ‘musical’ is not simply about learning an instrument. It involves a range of skills that can be developed through regular practice. - Early Years and Pre-Prep\n- Senior School\n- Sixth Form\n- Outside the Classroom\n- Individual Instrumental and Singing Lessons\nStudents engage in music learning from the very beginning of their Harrow journey. The first steps involve a variety of games to develop their co-ordination skills and engage their imaginations. As their journey progresses they are introduced to a variety of instruments and have the opportunity to explore different sounds. This continues as they progress through Pre-Prep, with increasing levels of musical vocabulary and the introduction of music notation. Students develop greater independence through their time in Prep, with an increasing emphasis on group work and research-influenced performing and composing. Students also have the opportunity to work with instrumental teachers during this time, for example through group lessons of guitars and wind instruments in Year 8. Students in Prep use an increasing amount of technology, particularly Garageband, to widen their skill base. Students in Year 9 continue to develop their understanding through group work and class discussion, using more complex vocabulary and making more complex connections between pieces and styles. They also learn to use Sibelius software at this stage.In Years 10 and 11, the CIE GCSE course is equipped to develop the musical skills of each student, with the final result being derived from coursework (30% performing and 30% composing) and a general listening exam (40%). The CIE AS\/A2 course combines musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, composing, performing as well as looking at music and musicians from a wider context. Students study a selection of contrasting set works from the Classical Period as well as a topic of ‘Picturing Music’. They also have options regarding the amount of performing and composing they do, opening the A-level to a wider range of students. At A2, students do not take a final exam. They may choose either a performing or composing option, along with an investigative report. We offer a wide ranging extra-curricular music programme, both during Enrichment Activity slots and also lunchtimes. Students of all ages and abilities can find something to engage their musical skills. These feed into the whole school concerts, which take place at Christmas and in the late spring. Students are also encouraged and supported in setting up their own ensembles and have many opportunities to demonstrate their skills throughout the year. As a member of FOBISIA, we have taken part in a number of their festivals, including the Primary Carnival, and acting as hosts for the older students’ Music Festival. Our older students also perform in the wider community, particularly at Christmas where they have become a fixture at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Christmas celebrations. - Pre-Prep Singers (Years 2-5)\n- Show Choir (Years 6-13)\n- Apri Canentes (Years 10-13 audition only)\n- Staff Choir\n- String Group\n- Chinese Drumming\n- Flute Choir (lunchtime activity)\n- Guitar Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Reed Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Ukulele Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Pre-Prep Pans (lunchtime activity)\n- Steelers (Year 6 – 9, beginner to intermediate steel pans)\n- Pantastic (Years 7 – 13 advanced steel pans)\nWe also offer individual 30 minute lessons on a wide variety of instruments. Our team of instrumental teachers are very experienced.",

They perform and study various musical styles and basic playing techniques. This subject is not a substitute for learning or studying a major musical instrument of student own choice within our Instrumental Music Program. Technical skills that are covered are very basic and classes involve general classroom music themes, too. All students are required to perform at the end of year concert as part of their major assessment. All students are welcome to join any of the major ensembles that Instrumental Music students enjoy! INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PROGRAM offers an ensemble-based instrumental music program. All music students involved with our teachers must participate in at least one of our established ensembles - Beginner Band, Concert Band, Symphonic Band, or Junior and Senior Stage Band; or, for our string players, String Orchestra or Junior String Ensemble or, for our vocalists, pianists, Senior and Junior Chorale and Concert Chorale. Chamber type or smaller ensembles such as Flutes and Drums Ensemble, Octetata are created over the year for advanced players, but all students must belong to one of the larger ensembles. This is all part of the instrumental music lessons paid for by our parents. Many concerts are held throughout the year. As a result of participating in the ensemble based program students are provided tuition on their instrument in either group or individual lessons with trained, highly qualified music staff. Instrumental Music Program is an extra-curricular program with rehearsals outside of school hours, and instrumental lessons and ensembles operating both in and outside of normal school timetable. It is integrated in a learning capacity with the Year 7 and 8 Classroom Music Program but it is considered as extension and enrichment. It is considered developmental learning particularly if students wish to continue on to VCE. Each student will complete major music exams (August \/ October) run by the music department providing the student with knowledge about the grade achieved, level attained, and skills demonstrated. They learn specific music skills, study technical works, scales, ensemble development, music expression, general knowledge and use the pedagogy or language of music to develop their communication skills. Our music department teachers offer support and encouragement to our students to enroll in AMEB, Trinity, ABRSM examinations over the course of the year, or students may be expected to compete in Eisteddfods and music competitions, all of which are exciting to perform in and are great levelers at establishing true benchmarks for measuring student musical achievements. The student is encouraged to set high personal goals in performance and we provide reports on how the student has gone about achieving those personal goals. Our aim is to provide a broad musical base whereby a student may have lots of musical involvement, learning and socialisation, and can draw upon a wide range of experiences from their participation and involvement within the Instrumental Music Program.

They told us several interesting facts about the orchestra and their positions within it. We were then given a chance to ask some questions. Once we were seated in the Grand Hall, we watched the orchestra setup, tune and start rehearsal. By watching the orchestra, we were exposed to the environment and level of professionalism commonly found within professional orchestras. A highlight of the day was listening to the pianist, Konstantin Shamray, play Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No 1: 2nd Movement along with the orchestra.

A total of 17 Concordia Campus students participated in this 26-kilometre walk and contributed to the almost $5,000 raised by Concordia to help children attend school in the Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya. Many staff members from both campuses also participated in the walk; while a few Year 12 Media students helped film the event. “This experience was eye-opening and moving as we walked from Hahndorf to Beaumont on the Pioneer Women’s Trail. On this journey, we were able to witness a small glimpse of what refugees face on a daily basis in the attempt to find safety. I think that this small journey has given me a better and wider understanding of the struggle that those who have no choice but to flee their home face and how significant that action is. I hope that by my actions, I have been able to help a child, who has taken a longer and more difficult journey, to have a brighter and better future” – Asha 10JLEY. “What do you think when you hear that we completed half a marathon of walking in one day? Well we managed to! Doing Walk my Way was an incredible experience. As soon as we arrived, we got a fantastic welcome and a cool hand-made bag filled with medical supplies along with a vibrant blue t-shirt! A huge crowd gathered for breakfast which was generously supplied by local businesses and the local church. We then went to a formal service where the Mayor of Mt Barker spoke as well as other distinguished guests. Once we began walking, we found out that this was a very long walk, but as it turns out we got used to it. Our friendship group ended up coping by singing karaoke songs the whole time. When we saw the bright orange cones at the end, we were overjoyed. This was such a fun challenge and for such a brilliant cause. We had just walked 26km!” – Tahlia 8MRID and Alicia 8MRID. Late last term, the Music Department was blessed to host Indigenous musician and World Vision ambassador Scott Darlow. Not only were the Music students from Years 8 to 11 blessed to hear Scott perform some of his wonderful music, they were also privileged to have the opportunity to listen to Scott speak candidly and honestly about his own personal journey as an Indigenous man living in Australia as well as touring the world as a musician. His message was powerful, at times confronting, but most importantly it was inspirational. We sincerely hope to have Scott back in the near future. Director of Music\nAn exciting part of our Pastoral Care program in Term 1 was the Year 8 Camp at Adare Campsite, Victor Harbor. We were very fortunate to be able to take GoPros with us on the camp experience so that we could film some of the treasured moments and challenges conquered, not to mention some of the hilarity and camaraderie among the Year 8 ‘tribe’ groups. On return to the College we held a competition in Year 8 to determine the favourite tribe video, as judged by Mr Weinert and the Year 8 Home Class teachers. Sophie and Lian from 8AMAR were the esteemed winners of the tribe video competition. Congratulations Sophie and Lian! Year 8 students also cemented their learning by creating posters for Murtoa which included camp photos and the IB Learner Profile aspects that were most enhanced by their Year 8 Camp experience. Again, Mr Weinert was our guest judge to determine the most successful IB Learner Profile posters. Our winners were:\nCongratulations Year 8s!

She says, “Music is now an important part of my life, like a daily meal with vitamin M – for MUSIC.” Lorrine is diligent with her music practices as she believes an active brain can prevent dementia. With a good and patient teacher, every lesson is time well spent with teacher Maria. Twelve-year-old Chow Wern is from the Advanced Ensemble Course at YMS Tampines. His mother, Mrs. Chow has this to share:\nChow Wern started his musical journey in Yamaha's Music Wonderland where he learned to appreciate and make music with his friends. He enjoyed it very much and has continued with Yamaha's group courses since. He is now in the second year of the Advanced Ensemble Course. Learning and playing music in a group makes it livelier and more interesting. Chow Wern and his course mates are able to learn from each other and being in a group also motivates him to practice more. As he said, \"I like the Yamaha group courses. I love learning and playing music in a group. Not only that, I get to bond with my course mates and be long time buddies.\" I also like that the group courses exposed him to ensemble playing. He enjoys it that each person has a different part to play and all have to listen to each other's parts and come together to play a good piece. He likes ensemble playing very much that it inspired him to join Chinese Orchestra in school and learn a new instrument, Sheng. The courses also exposed him to create and write his own music. This has encouraged him to explore musical ideas and write his own compositions. With the help of his teacher in improving his compositions, he is fortunate to have his works selected to perform in the school Yamaha Junior Original Concert twice. Performing in this Concert also gave him a chance to see the other students' compositions and inspired him to try to create more pieces. In his words, Chow Wern feels that \"the courses have benefited me as I have learned the basics of music and now I'm learning the more advanced side of it. The courses have helped developed my musical aptitude and abilities. I'm truly lucky to learn and love music in an encouraging and happy environment.\" His younger sister, Chow Huey has also started her musical experience with Yamaha. She is now in the 3rd year of the Yamaha Junior Course and enjoys her lessons tremendously. I am glad that both of them are enjoying their music lessons and hope that it's a skill that they will learn and keep, and make music a part of their lives. Nine-year-old Matthew Yap is a first year student of Junior Ensemble Course (JNC) at YMS Plaza Singapura. His mother, Ms. Lim Mei Yih has this to say about the learning experience of Matthew:\nMy hubby and I have no regrets signing Matthew up for the Yamaha Junior course. The course not only emphasizes teaching the children to play on the keyboard, but it also trains them in abilities to listen, sing solfege and respond rhythmically. Matthew is always looking forward to his class and he enjoys learning music with a group of his friends. They have a lot of fun during and after the lessons. He is motivated by the exposure to different genres of music and was excited that he had a chance to perform in Junior Original Concert at the school. The performance at the concert has given Matthew a valuable experience. It gave his confidence a boost, and he is looking forward to another opportunity in the near future. Samantha Kunafi is 9 years old, and in her first year of Junior Ensemble Course (JNC) at YMS Plaza Singapura. Her Mum, Susan Purnomo says:\nOne of Yamaha's unique strong point is, the exposure to creativity in the music lessons. They are taught and encouraged to compose their own melody and thereafter play with variations. Unlike private piano lessons, Yamaha group class is very interactive and fun. The songs in the curriculum are catchy and able to pique the interest of the children. When Samantha completed the 4th year of Yamaha Junior Course, she was given an opportunity to present her composition at the Junior Original Concert at the school. In preparation for this performance, Samantha was motivated to play expressively and her confidence was given a boost. Samantha is now in JNC and I can see further development in Samantha's interest in music. I do see her trying to play pieces out of her textbook curriculum. She really enjoys going to her weekly Yamaha music lessons. Eleven-year-old Yeo Yu Ann is a first year student of Advanced Ensemble Course (ANC) at YMS Tampines.",

            "passage": "I would teach children music, physics and philosophy: but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning. (Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods. Music complements the vision and core values of Greengate Lane Academy. Our belief is that the Greengate Lane school values are weaved throughout our curriculum to support our pupils and our school community, our Music lessons are structured as follows:\n- SCHOLARSHIP: our music curriculum allows our children to be scholarly, they are taught the subject in depth, progressively building on prior knowledge, resulting in children remembering more and being able to articulate what that have learnt. - CURIOUSITY: music lessons encourage pupils to contribute through discussion and collaboration; pupils reflect on their own ideas and those of others, they are encouraged to ask questions and be curious. - TENACITY: the music curriculum encourages pupil to overcome challenges and learn about how to continually improve on their musical compositions based off of the opinions and advice of their peers. - ASPIRATIONAL: pupils are given the opportunity to perform their compositions to the rest of the school and at whole school events, which they will work on to perfect for extended periods of time\n- KINDNESS: lessons are structured so that children learn skills together and support each other in partner work. Our curriculum drivers (vocabulary acquisition, SMSC, cultural awareness) are at the heart of all our music lessons:\nVOCABULARY ACQUSITION: children are continually introduced to new, subject specific vocabulary which they are encouraged to use regularly. SMSC: children are introduced to many different musical genres and encouraged to appraise these, forming opinions on what they like, dislike and appreciate the composition and creativity of the music they are surrounded by. CUTLURAL AWARENESS: as part of the music curriculum, children are introduced to music from a variety of different cultures and time periods, whilst being encouraged to analyse the similarities and differences these have from each other. At Greengate Lane Academy, we teach music through the Charanga scheme. The scheme provides teachers with carefully sequenced week-by-week lessons for each year group in the school, from ages 5–11. It has lesson plans, assessment, clear progression, and engaging and exciting whiteboard resources for every lesson. The Scheme supports all the requirements of the national curriculum and is in line with published Ofsted guidance. In EYFS children will focus on:\n- Listening and Responding\n- Exploring and Creating Singing\n- Sharing and Performing\nIn Key Stage 1 and 2 children will focus on:\n- Listening and appraising\n- Musical activities (games, singing, playing instruments, improvisation, composition)\n- Performing and Sharing\nThese are taught across the school; learning deepens and broadens in each year group. Lessons are delivered by class teachers to their own classes each week in order to teach the required knowledge and skills in a developmental and age-appropriate way. In addition to this, in Year 4\/5 the children have the opportunity to learn Samba Drumming with a specialist teacher. Impact of the Curriculum\nIn music, teachers assess pupils’ learning in lessons and adapt their teaching to be responsive to pupils understanding. As the curriculum progresses it is increasingly more challenging and pupils have the opportunity to review and extend their understanding over time as well as combine and apply different aspects of knowledge an skills development.",

    "text": "I don´t know what its like to have a child with CP, and I don’t know what it feels like when you are told the diagnosis for the first time. However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent.\nThroughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret.\nGuilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you.\nGuilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.\nI’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP.\nI think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day.\nJust as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret.\nP.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP.\nLoss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\nAs someone with CP, I’ve felt loss and regret to because of the CP. I felt loss when I realized I had to give up my dream as a kid to become a professional soccer player, and I’ve felt both feelings when I couldn’t participate in something with my friends or felt like an outsider. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate something that has always been there as a part of the CP, and that is my initial perspective on life.\nAs I mentioned above, life with CP is all I know, and all I will know. This has some really good benefits. It means that I won’t always feel the need or desire to be closer to “normal”, simply because I have no idea what it means to not have CP, I can’t really imagine it. This can create some conflicts between the person with CP and their loved ones too. Where the parents for example may want to push their child to exercise more, stretch more, or try harder to walk or walk better, the person with CP, may be content with their functional level as it is, and may not see the point.\nWe both have a responsibility here. The parent should try to understand this, that we don’t necessarily want to be just like an able bodied. Some may, but that may lead to more harm than good. You can’t change the CP; you can’t cure it, at least not right now. And because of that, if you are constantly want something you cannot have, and constantly hating what you have and what you are, you are going to be pretty miserable. Therefore, I would advise you, as a parent to help your child accept their CP rather than fight it. It is not your enemy, nor is it theirs, its a part of them.\nAs people with CP we also have to understand that even if we don’t always see the change the point in stretching or exercises, or even surgeries, we should try to think of the fact that we want to stay happy in the future. The work that you put down now, can be really important later down the road. I used to hate this kind of reasoning however, and I am not expecting you to like it either, so if that doesn’t motivate you, try to find smaller more achievable goals of improvement that you can see in a shorter time period.\nAlso, remember that because your parents want you to exercise more, or walk better or what have you, it doesn’t mean they think you aren’t good enough, you are, and its not about that. They view life from their perspective, and what they have been able to do and enjoy in life, they just want you to feel many of the joys in life that they have, because they love you, not because they don’t think you’re good enough.\nIt is my hope that we can continue to learn from each other, and grow together. That way, we can heal each other and the scars that may open, so I hope you will accept and embrace this open letter as my contribution towards that.\nIf you have had any of these feelings and experiences, either as a parent or as someone with CP, please feel free to comment below and share on your favourite social media, it really helps us grow and write more of these articles!

Regret is often associated with the constant reminders of the differences their child faces due to Cerebral Palsy.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: I don´t know what its like to have a child with CP, and I don’t know what it feels like when you are told the diagnosis for the first time. However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent. Throughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret. Guilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you. Guilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all. I’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP. I think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day. Just as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret. P.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP. Loss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\n\nRaising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”\n\nSpecifically, we found parents were more likely to be classified as resolved if their child had a correctable condition such as cleft lip, where surgery could repair the majority of the disfigurement. Parents were more likely to be classified as unresolved if their child had a diagnosis that did not have a medical remedy such as limb deficiencies and cerebral palsy (Barnett et al., 1999). However, child condition made only a tiny contribution to parental adaptation. Several processes that we hypothesize may interfere with parents achieving resolution are listed in Table 3. We believe the unfolding nature of parents' knowledge of their child's prognosis to be one of the biggest challenges to parental adaptation. Specifically, a parent may understand that the child has serious motor impairments and will not walk. However, it may be years before they actually experience the emotions. For example, they may not fully realize their grief until they see their child not walking when his or her peers are, or their child not running and playing tag, when other children are. At each new developmental phase, the parent is likely to experience new emotions related to the child's condition. This developmental unfolding appears to be particularly stressful for parents. They may begin to master their thoughts and feelings, only to have them reawakened over and over. For these reasons, one of the goals of our intervention is to help parents understand the ongoing challenges of raising a child with special needs and to develop the confidence and tools needed to adapt not only in the present, but to anticipate future change and to adapt accordingly. A GROUP INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\nBecause many families report finding it significantly challenging to raise a child with special needs, and because these children are at risk for adjustment problems, we have developed an empirically informed intervention that can improve parent and child well-being. Our group intervention is geared toward parents who have a toddler or a preschooler with special needs. The group was designed for parents of children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and related disorders. It can be adapted to address other conditions. The primary focus is the parent or family psychosocial adaptation to their child rather than working directly with their child per se. Currently, we are offering groups to parents who have known of their child's diagnosis for at least 6 months. We believe that parents should be past the period of initial shock or what Miller (1994) refers to as “surviving” and to have had a chance to learn first hand about their child's condition and some of its implications. Both the literature and parents in our groups suggested that several months are needed to process the medical information on their own or with trusted loved ones, before they are ready to discuss these matters in a group setting with mental health professionals and other parents. We decided not to offer the group to parents of newborns, in part so that they had more time to process the diagnostic information, and because many of the developmental manifestations of their baby's special needs may not be evident until they are older. In contrast, toddlers and preschoolers share a number of developmental issues pertaining to early autonomy and the initial developmental milestones of locomotion and communication (Erickson & Kurz-Riemer, 1999). At the same time, there may be some parents who are more open to change during the initial period of shock and distress. Perhaps the opportunity to engage parents becomes time-limited as some quickly reject their child, placing him or her in the care of a relative or foster parent. An intervention by Pelchat et al. (1999) provided individual counseling by nurses, starting in the hospital and continuing at home soon after the child's birth. Pelchat and colleagues' intervention was based in systems theory. It also had a broad focus that included an effort “To help the parent gain a realistic understanding of the situation and to help them grieve their dream of a perfect child” (p. 468). Those parents who completed the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in their adjustment and social support compared with comparison parents, even when parents were reassessed a year after the intervention. Consequently, identifying when optimally to offer interventions is an open and important question. Our intervention is grounded both in the stress, support, and coping as well as in the grief and adaptation research reviewed in the initial sections of this article.\n\nNo parent wants to think about the possibility of their child having cerebral palsy. This injury, which occurs during or just prior to birth, affects the brain causing everyday challenges for those afflicted. Affecting the brain also means that there are numerous types of cerebral palsy, each with their own unique symptoms. Doctors have a hard time understanding everything about this disability because there are so many variations of cerebral palsy. For a more in-depth explanation of the various versions children suffer from, continue reading. Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\nThis form is considered the rarest version of the disability and the least-diagnosed. Ataxic cerebral palsy has an effect only on a child’s precise motor skills. Symptoms will manifest themselves in minor ways like challenges with balance and a speech impediment because of issues in the inner ear. Minute tasks like buttoning up a shirt or tying shoelaces will also be difficult and may bring about tremors when the child becomes frustrated. Athetoid Cerebral Palsy\nAthetoid cerebral palsy is the most widespread type. Unfortunately, this version suppresses a child’s ability to intellectually express themselves, which means they can feel trapped inside their own body. Choreoathetoid Cerebral Palsy\nChoreoathetoid cerebral palsy is much like the athetoid cerebral palsy, except that it also involves involuntary twitching. Diplegic Cerebral Palsy\nYou may hear this type of cerebral palsy called Little’s Disease or spastic diplegia. This was the first version to ever be diagnosed and given a name. Children with diplegic cerebral palsy are afflicted with muscle spasticity and tense muscles, but only in their lower body. In some cases, children’s legs actually cross over one another at the knees involuntarily, making walking very challenging. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy\nAn injury to the brain that originates from a hypoxic-ischemic injury or bilirubin encephalopathy can cause what is known as dyskinetic cerebral palsy. It is also a name sometimes used to describe athetoid cerebral palsy. Dystonic Cerebral Palsy\nDystonic cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormal muscular movements that are usually either spastic or extremely sluggish. Writhing movements are common as well. As a result, children with dystonic cerebral palsy have muscles that can be tight or floppy. Epidural Hematoma Cerebral Palsy\nMost cerebral palsy types get their names from the symptoms they cause. However, with epidural hematoma cerebral palsy, its name actually stems from how the child got the disorder. This version is the result of a stroke, usually suffered by the child during the birthing process. Grade 1 IHV Cerebral Palsy\nGrade 1 IHV cerebral palsy is generally a very mild form. Most children who suffer from it will recover after some developmental challenges, so long as they undergo various forms of physical therapy. Hypertonic or Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy\nThe symptoms that accompany this kind of cerebral palsy appear early on, making it easy to diagnose. Babies with hypertonic or hypotonic cerebral palsy are sometimes compared to rag dolls. They do not stiffen when their limbs are moved or they are picked up. Hemiparetic or Hemiphlegic Cerebral Palsy\nStrokes can also cause hemiparetic cerebral palsy, which only affects the left or right side of the child’s body. On the affected side, they will suffer from either muscle spasticity or stiffness. Generally, the arm and hand are affected or the child’s leg, but not both. Speech problems may be experienced too. Children who have this version are also more vulnerable to seizures. Non-spastic (Extrapyramidial) Cerebral Palsy\nWhile the muscles do not involuntarily contract or twist with this form of axatic cerebral palsy, speech problems, motor skill challenge and respiratory issues are still present. Periventricular Leukomalacia Cerebral Palsy\nChildren with this version of cerebral palsy may have some difficulties with their muscles, but it mainly affects their brain. They are more likely to experience seizures than with other forms and may develop epilepsy. A child that has spastic quadriplegia will lack control of their limbs. Developmental milestones, therefore, will take a lot longer to reach. Sadly, the path to these developmental markers may also be quite painful.\n\nWhen a newborn is diagnosed with a birth injury it can impact every member of your family. Understanding these impacts, understanding your coping mechanisms, and understanding what options your family has available are all important for helping your family heal, manage, and start to move on. In many cases, birth injuries will have lifelong effects. These effects can impact the family in a variety of different ways. While the financial impacts are often the most immediate, and the most tangible, the emotional and psychological impacts can affect all family members’ lives as well. For families, the financial costs of a birth injury can be substantial. While health insurance might cover your child’s medical needs to an extent, most families will incur medical bills, and many families will not be able to afford to pay what they owe. For example, today, the lifetime costs of care for a newborn diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) can climb to well above one million dollars. This is a comparable cost to many other birth injury diagnoses. Families can face other financial costs as a result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. For example, parents will often need to miss significant time from work in order to take their children to doctor’s appointments and provide at-home care. Ultimately parents may decide that it is best for one of them to leave their job and stay home full-time. Even then it may be necessary to hire at-home help ranging from nurses and therapists to landscapers and cleaners. Depending on a child’s specific diagnosis parents may also need to incur costs for home and vehicle modifications. These costs might be immediate or they might become necessary as the child grows. Similarly, while a child who has been diagnosed with a birth injury may need a certain type of care initially, over time, his or her needs may shift to require the engagement of therapists, social workers, tutors, and other specialists. As a result, when planning for their financial needs, parents must consider more than just their current medical expenses. They must consider the other financial impacts of their child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. Some families may need to scale back in other areas and many will need to seek financial assistance—whether now or in the future. A birth injury can also have emotional and psychological impacts on all members of the family. Generally speaking, these impacts will be different for the parents, the child’s siblings, and the child. As a parent, learning that your child has been diagnosed with a life-altering birth injury can be heartbreaking. It can take time to come to terms with your child’s diagnosis and your family’s situation and you may need time to grieve. While grieving can be both healthy and necessary parents should also consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist. It is important to be able to cope effectively while still being present in the family’s day-to-day life. Anxiety and depression are not uncommon among parents whose children have been diagnosed with birth injuries. Parents may also experience hypertension and other physical effects. As a parent, as you begin to cope, it will be important to be aware of the signs that you may need to consult with a doctor. The financial stress that many families experience as the result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis can also lead to emotional and psychological strain. The stress of coping with your family’s situation can strain many couples’ relationships as well. Again, it is important to recognize that these are possibilities and to seek professional help when necessary. Having a brother or sister with a birth injury can also be emotionally difficult. Young children may not understand how or why their sibling is different, and this confusion can impact how they process their own personal circumstances as they grow. Children can also find it difficult if their parents spend more time or devote more attention to their sibling—even if this is due to their sibling’s unique needs. Unfortunately, children can also experience impacts in their social lives. Even at relatively young ages, children can face bullying or ostracization as the result of having a brother or sister who is different. These can have their own psychological effects; and, as a result, parents may need to watch for signs of childhood anxiety and depression as well. Lastly, a birth injury impacts the child who has been diagnosed. In addition to the direct cognitive effects of the birth injury itself, growing up with a birth injury can have significant emotional and psychological consequences. This is particularly true once children begin to see how they are different from their peers—and this can begin to happen at a relatively young age.\n\nCerebral palsy in adults can present many unique and unresolved challenges. Medical professionals do not yet have a clear view of how to manage all the issues relevant to an individual with cerebral palsy. Health problems such as arthritis, strained organs, and fatigue can plague patients as they grow older. The disease can affect a person's ability to work or care for him or herself, and aging parents and family members may no longer be available for intensive assistance and care. Ongoing research in the field provides physicians, patients, and their families with hope for new treatments and therapies. A better understanding of the disease will serve to address many of the challenges faced by cerebral palsy in adults. A person diagnosed with cerebral palsy most often experiences an extreme strain on the systems of his or her body. Premature aging is normal and frequently seen in adults with this condition by the time they reach the age of 40. Organs like the heart and lungs may not have developed fully, and have spent decades working in overdrive to respond to the demands of the body. Arthritis is also commonly associated with cerebral palsy in adults, due to years of disproportionate joint compression and a limited range of motion. Cerebral palsy in adults can cause fatigue that interferes with the individual's ability to work or care for him or herself. The complications associated with cerebral palsy and growing older, like premature aging and arthritis, can be draining and difficult to live with. Additionally, the simple act of moving around requires a person living with this disease to exert three to five times the amount of energy as an average person. This extreme strain can limit a person's ability to work in traditional employment. A person affected by cerebral palsy may have had a large support system as a child. Parents are usually available and involved in the upbringing of a child with a developmental or physical illness, and cerebral palsy is no exception. One challenge that occurs with cerebral palsy in adults is the aging of the patient's parents and family. The individual's parents may no longer be living, or could be handling their own medical issues related to aging. Cerebral palsy support groups can be instrumental in assisting an adult living with the disease. Without support, it can be difficult for the person to navigate issues like employment, health care, insurance, and living arrangements. Group homes are an option for people who suffer from severe cerebral palsy, and require daily, hands-on assistance with self-care and feeding.\n\nThe Top Cerebral Palsy Myths\nMany myths about cerebral palsy (CP) persist despite enormous advocacy efforts. These myths also put undue stress on parents and other family members of children with CP. The following list clears up 17 of the most pervasive myths about cerebral palsy:\nCP is a progressive condition. This misconception may come from the confusion of CP with certain neurological disorders, such as Tay–Sachs disease, that are degenerative. Those disorders worsen as the patient gets older. In contrast, cerebral palsy symptoms do not generally increase in severity and instead may actually improve over time. Continued research into surgical options and other therapeutic strategies has made the latter scenario more common in recent years. People with CP can’t live independently. It is true that some people with cerebral palsy need to be cared for their entire lives through family and caregiver support. However, many adults with CP are independent, while others may still require some help. Adults with CP who live independently may make use of the following strategies:\n- Assistive technologies, including mobility aids and transfer equipment. - Modifications to the home and workplace, such as lower countertops for wheelchair users. - Personal care assistance for potentially difficult tasks, such as household chores. Children with Cerebral Palsy can’t communicate. While children with cerebral palsy are more likely to also have language disorders and hearing impairments, many do not. And, those who do have challenges may overcome them through speech therapy and the use of communication devices. Children with CP are intellectually disabled. It is important to remember that, while a neurological disorder, CP is fundamentally a problem with motor function. Still, as many as half of children with CP also have some level of cognitive impairment. This ranges from very mild to severe intellectual disability. Children with CP are also more likely than the general population to have learning disabilities — which are distinct from intellectual disabilities. CP is the same for everyone. CP is actually an umbrella term for a diverse group of neurological disorders that may involve very different symptoms. The four main types of CP are:\n- Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Pyramidal)\n- Athetoid Cerebral Palsy (Extrapyramidal or Dyskinetic)\n- Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n- Mixed Cerebral Palsy\nAnd within each is a wide range of symptoms and severities. For example, one child with spastic CP might have trouble controlling a single arm, while another child with the same condition may have quadriplegia with all four limbs severely affected. Your child’s specific needs and challenges will be unique. Colleges do not accommodate students with Cerebral Palsy. It is increasingly common for young adults with cerebral palsy to pursue a college education. In the US, colleges that receive federal funding — the vast majority of institutions of higher education — are legally required to make accommodations for all disabled students, including those with CP. Even many colleges that don’t receive federal funding often voluntarily offer assistance to students with CP. Accommodations may include following the recommendations outlined in a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), as well as ensuring accessibility to campus facilities. Having CP won’t prevent your child from receiving a quality education. Cerebral Palsy is always caused by medical malpractice. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly following a child’s birth. It could also be due to a condition that results in the brain failing to develop properly. This may be mediated by injury, inflammation, or a lack of oxygen. While it’s true that some cases of CP may be caused by medical malpractice, many are not. Common causes of CP include:\n- Serious maternal infection during pregnancy. - Brain infections after birth, such as meningitis. - Birth complications. - Head trauma. - Congenital disorders, such as heart defects and issues with blood clotting. - Medication errors. - Maternal substance abuse\nFactors that increase the risk for CP include:\n- Premature birth. - Low birth weight. - Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets). - Certain infertility treatments, which increase the chance of having multiple births. - Maternal health conditions, such as seizures and thyroid disorders. Parenting a child with CP is overwhelming.\n\nHow to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy? Cerebral palsy, or CP, refers to a group of developmental conditions that have several features in common. All are caused by some kind of injury to the developing brain. The injury can occur in the womb, during the birth of the baby, or in the first couple of years after birth. Common risk factors for CP include prematurity, low birth weight, multiple gestation, and infection.1\nindividuals in Canada are diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy (CP)\nIn Canada CP affects 1 in every 400 individuals and is the most common physical disability in children. The hallmark disability for individuals with CP is related to motor function – how a person develops and maintains control of their movement. Children with CP almost always have issues with whole-body movement, including walking, and often in using their hands and arms. In addition, they may also have other challenges resulting from their brain injury, including problems with seizures, learning, communicating, vision and hearing, and behaviour. What is hemiplegic or unilateral CP? of children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy have hemiplegic CP. ‘Hemiplegia’, ‘hemiparesis’, or ‘unilateral’ CP affects the movement and muscle tone on one side of the body, although often the other side of the body may be affected to a lesser extent.2 It is the most common form of CP, with estimates ranging from 33-39% of all people with CP.3,4 A ‘stroke’ in the time before, during or after birth is the most common cause of hemiplegic CP. Multiple factors may interact to block the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke. Many times the cause of the stroke will never be known.5 As one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body is affected; this can result in weakness of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. Sixty percent of children with hemiplegic CP have seizures in the newborn period. What are the early signs of hemiplegic CP? Hemiplegic CP frequently presents in the first year of life when parents notice a hand preference, which is very unusual in children at this age. Other signs include fisting of one hand and flexion (bending) of the elbow on the affected side. In supported standing, the child may stand flatfooted on their more functional side and up on the toes of the hemiplegic side. Likewise, the child may not bear weight well through the affected hand or foot. Some asymmetry in function might be noted when the child is crawling or attempting other motor activities and as a result the child’s crawling is often delayed. For children under the age of 18 months, some ‘red flags’ include:\n- Favouring one hand, leaving the other hand in a fist or reaching across their body to grab objects, or not bringing both hands together during play\n- Delays in early motor milestones – rolling, sitting, pulling to stand, crawling, and walking\n- Stiffness or weakness in muscles on one side of the body\n- Difficulty with the early development of walking and balance\n- Asymmetrical movement and posture\nHow is hemiplegic CP diagnosed? Hemiplegia is a condition best recognized by the story the parents tell and the observations we make when watching children in action. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan is the preferred method of neuroimaging for CP.3 MRI is useful for identifying the presence and location of a brain injury in almost 90% of children with CP.6 Children with hemiplegia commonly have abnormal cranial ultrasounds. What is the outlook for children with hemiplegic CP? The gross motor function of 88% of children with hemiplegia is classified as GMFCS level 1.7\nThis means that almost all children with hemiplegia can walk by 2 years of age without assistive devices, and by age 6 can:\n- Walk long distances outdoors and on uneven surfaces\n- Move from the floor or a chair to standing without using their hands for support\n- Go up and down stairs without needing to hold the handrail\n- Are beginning to run and jump. Some potential challenges include:\n- Difficulties with voluntary movement in one arm, for instance difficulty opening their hand, picking up small objects, turning the hand over. In the leg, there may be toe walking on the one side which can cause tripping.\n\nHow to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy?

The hallmark disability for individuals with CP is related to motor function – how a person develops and maintains control of their movement. Children with CP almost always have issues with whole-body movement, including walking, and often in using their hands and arms. In addition, they may also have other challenges resulting from their brain injury, including problems with seizures, learning, communicating, vision and hearing, and behaviour. What is hemiplegic or unilateral CP? of children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy have hemiplegic CP. ‘Hemiplegia’, ‘hemiparesis’, or ‘unilateral’ CP affects the movement and muscle tone on one side of the body, although often the other side of the body may be affected to a lesser extent.2 It is the most common form of CP, with estimates ranging from 33-39% of all people with CP.3,4 A ‘stroke’ in the time before, during or after birth is the most common cause of hemiplegic CP. Multiple factors may interact to block the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke. Many times the cause of the stroke will never be known.5 As one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body is affected; this can result in weakness of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. Sixty percent of children with hemiplegic CP have seizures in the newborn period. What are the early signs of hemiplegic CP? Hemiplegic CP frequently presents in the first year of life when parents notice a hand preference, which is very unusual in children at this age. Other signs include fisting of one hand and flexion (bending) of the elbow on the affected side. In supported standing, the child may stand flatfooted on their more functional side and up on the toes of the hemiplegic side. Likewise, the child may not bear weight well through the affected hand or foot. Some asymmetry in function might be noted when the child is crawling or attempting other motor activities and as a result the child’s crawling is often delayed. For children under the age of 18 months, some ‘red flags’ include:\n- Favouring one hand, leaving the other hand in a fist or reaching across their body to grab objects, or not bringing both hands together during play\n- Delays in early motor milestones – rolling, sitting, pulling to stand, crawling, and walking\n- Stiffness or weakness in muscles on one side of the body\n- Difficulty with the early development of walking and balance\n- Asymmetrical movement and posture\nHow is hemiplegic CP diagnosed? Hemiplegia is a condition best recognized by the story the parents tell and the observations we make when watching children in action. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan is the preferred method of neuroimaging for CP.3 MRI is useful for identifying the presence and location of a brain injury in almost 90% of children with CP.6 Children with hemiplegia commonly have abnormal cranial ultrasounds. What is the outlook for children with hemiplegic CP? The gross motor function of 88% of children with hemiplegia is classified as GMFCS level 1.7\nThis means that almost all children with hemiplegia can walk by 2 years of age without assistive devices, and by age 6 can:\n- Walk long distances outdoors and on uneven surfaces\n- Move from the floor or a chair to standing without using their hands for support\n- Go up and down stairs without needing to hold the handrail\n- Are beginning to run and jump. Some potential challenges include:\n- Difficulties with voluntary movement in one arm, for instance difficulty opening their hand, picking up small objects, turning the hand over. In the leg, there may be toe walking on the one side which can cause tripping.\n\nWhen being diagnosed for any condition, disease or illness, it is essential to the effectiveness of the treatment that this is received as soon as possible. When such a diagnosis is “delayed,” the result can be extremely detrimental. This is true for cerebral palsy as well as other disabling conditions. When seeking a diagnosis of a condition, parents and caretakers should make sure diagnosticians are focused on the case at hand. When hospital workloads or scheduling are inefficient, a delayed diagnosis can be the result. Here are some important suggestions for obtaining an early diagnosis. According to Frederick B. Palmer MD, methods for early cerebral palsy diagnosis include a large variety of measures of the underlying brain dysfunctions alongside their neurodevelopmental reactions. These can be categorized into the following three areas: functional confinement; impairment and pathogenesis. One of the best techniques for measuring pathogenesis to diagnose cerebral palsy in the preterm and term infant, is neuroimaging. Neurological impairment is measured vis-à-vis muscle tone, reflexes and other similar indications. What makes a diagnosis tricky with babies is that these are not all that predictive in the first few months of life. A baby’s neurological system is not yet completely developed at this point. In most cases, therefore, a diagnosis using neuroimaging can only be determined after the baby reaches six months. Nonetheless, parents should understand that if a newborn of 16-20 weeks displays abnormal spontaneous general movements along with functional impediments in this time period, these have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. One way parents can improve their chances of obtaining an early diagnosis of cerebral palsy for their child is by detecting abnormal spontaneous movements. Usually, this is caught in conjunction with an organized follow-up program and development surveillance. Parents concerned that their child may have cerebral palsy and those who are looking for the earliest diagnosis possible, should look for the following: muscle tone variations (too stiff or too flexible); exaggerated reflexes; stiffness with normal reflexes; problematic muscle coordination; tremors\/involuntary movements; slow, writhing movements; motor skill milestone achievement like crawling, sitting up etc. ; a preference for one side of the body; problems walking (which may be seen through a child walking on their tiptoes); difficulty swallowing or excessive drooling; difficulty eating\/sucking; speech delays, etc. While cerebral palsy is a very challenging condition with which to live, the earlier the diagnosis, the better level of treatment and hope for integrating into a normal life the child will have. Obviously, the prevalence of one or more of these conditions does not mean that the child has cerebral palsy. It does mean, however, that there is a red flag that should certainly send parents to a doctor for further evaluations.\n\nQuestion:What are the three main emotional challenges parents face when having a child with Cerebral Palsy?",

            "passage": "I don´t know what its like to have a child with CP, and I don’t know what it feels like when you are told the diagnosis for the first time. However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent. Throughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret. Guilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you. Guilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all. I’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP. I think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day. Just as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret. P.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP. Loss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.",

            "passage": "Raising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”",

            "passage": "Specifically, we found parents were more likely to be classified as resolved if their child had a correctable condition such as cleft lip, where surgery could repair the majority of the disfigurement. Parents were more likely to be classified as unresolved if their child had a diagnosis that did not have a medical remedy such as limb deficiencies and cerebral palsy (Barnett et al., 1999). However, child condition made only a tiny contribution to parental adaptation. Several processes that we hypothesize may interfere with parents achieving resolution are listed in Table 3. We believe the unfolding nature of parents' knowledge of their child's prognosis to be one of the biggest challenges to parental adaptation. Specifically, a parent may understand that the child has serious motor impairments and will not walk. However, it may be years before they actually experience the emotions. For example, they may not fully realize their grief until they see their child not walking when his or her peers are, or their child not running and playing tag, when other children are. At each new developmental phase, the parent is likely to experience new emotions related to the child's condition. This developmental unfolding appears to be particularly stressful for parents. They may begin to master their thoughts and feelings, only to have them reawakened over and over. For these reasons, one of the goals of our intervention is to help parents understand the ongoing challenges of raising a child with special needs and to develop the confidence and tools needed to adapt not only in the present, but to anticipate future change and to adapt accordingly. A GROUP INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\nBecause many families report finding it significantly challenging to raise a child with special needs, and because these children are at risk for adjustment problems, we have developed an empirically informed intervention that can improve parent and child well-being. Our group intervention is geared toward parents who have a toddler or a preschooler with special needs. The group was designed for parents of children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and related disorders. It can be adapted to address other conditions. The primary focus is the parent or family psychosocial adaptation to their child rather than working directly with their child per se. Currently, we are offering groups to parents who have known of their child's diagnosis for at least 6 months. We believe that parents should be past the period of initial shock or what Miller (1994) refers to as “surviving” and to have had a chance to learn first hand about their child's condition and some of its implications. Both the literature and parents in our groups suggested that several months are needed to process the medical information on their own or with trusted loved ones, before they are ready to discuss these matters in a group setting with mental health professionals and other parents. We decided not to offer the group to parents of newborns, in part so that they had more time to process the diagnostic information, and because many of the developmental manifestations of their baby's special needs may not be evident until they are older. In contrast, toddlers and preschoolers share a number of developmental issues pertaining to early autonomy and the initial developmental milestones of locomotion and communication (Erickson & Kurz-Riemer, 1999). At the same time, there may be some parents who are more open to change during the initial period of shock and distress. Perhaps the opportunity to engage parents becomes time-limited as some quickly reject their child, placing him or her in the care of a relative or foster parent. An intervention by Pelchat et al. (1999) provided individual counseling by nurses, starting in the hospital and continuing at home soon after the child's birth. Pelchat and colleagues' intervention was based in systems theory. It also had a broad focus that included an effort “To help the parent gain a realistic understanding of the situation and to help them grieve their dream of a perfect child” (p. 468). Those parents who completed the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in their adjustment and social support compared with comparison parents, even when parents were reassessed a year after the intervention. Consequently, identifying when optimally to offer interventions is an open and important question. Our intervention is grounded both in the stress, support, and coping as well as in the grief and adaptation research reviewed in the initial sections of this article.",

            "passage": "No parent wants to think about the possibility of their child having cerebral palsy. This injury, which occurs during or just prior to birth, affects the brain causing everyday challenges for those afflicted. Affecting the brain also means that there are numerous types of cerebral palsy, each with their own unique symptoms. Doctors have a hard time understanding everything about this disability because there are so many variations of cerebral palsy. For a more in-depth explanation of the various versions children suffer from, continue reading. Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\nThis form is considered the rarest version of the disability and the least-diagnosed. Ataxic cerebral palsy has an effect only on a child’s precise motor skills. Symptoms will manifest themselves in minor ways like challenges with balance and a speech impediment because of issues in the inner ear. Minute tasks like buttoning up a shirt or tying shoelaces will also be difficult and may bring about tremors when the child becomes frustrated. Athetoid Cerebral Palsy\nAthetoid cerebral palsy is the most widespread type. Unfortunately, this version suppresses a child’s ability to intellectually express themselves, which means they can feel trapped inside their own body. Choreoathetoid Cerebral Palsy\nChoreoathetoid cerebral palsy is much like the athetoid cerebral palsy, except that it also involves involuntary twitching. Diplegic Cerebral Palsy\nYou may hear this type of cerebral palsy called Little’s Disease or spastic diplegia. This was the first version to ever be diagnosed and given a name. Children with diplegic cerebral palsy are afflicted with muscle spasticity and tense muscles, but only in their lower body. In some cases, children’s legs actually cross over one another at the knees involuntarily, making walking very challenging. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy\nAn injury to the brain that originates from a hypoxic-ischemic injury or bilirubin encephalopathy can cause what is known as dyskinetic cerebral palsy. It is also a name sometimes used to describe athetoid cerebral palsy. Dystonic Cerebral Palsy\nDystonic cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormal muscular movements that are usually either spastic or extremely sluggish. Writhing movements are common as well. As a result, children with dystonic cerebral palsy have muscles that can be tight or floppy. Epidural Hematoma Cerebral Palsy\nMost cerebral palsy types get their names from the symptoms they cause. However, with epidural hematoma cerebral palsy, its name actually stems from how the child got the disorder. This version is the result of a stroke, usually suffered by the child during the birthing process. Grade 1 IHV Cerebral Palsy\nGrade 1 IHV cerebral palsy is generally a very mild form. Most children who suffer from it will recover after some developmental challenges, so long as they undergo various forms of physical therapy. Hypertonic or Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy\nThe symptoms that accompany this kind of cerebral palsy appear early on, making it easy to diagnose. Babies with hypertonic or hypotonic cerebral palsy are sometimes compared to rag dolls. They do not stiffen when their limbs are moved or they are picked up. Hemiparetic or Hemiphlegic Cerebral Palsy\nStrokes can also cause hemiparetic cerebral palsy, which only affects the left or right side of the child’s body. On the affected side, they will suffer from either muscle spasticity or stiffness. Generally, the arm and hand are affected or the child’s leg, but not both. Speech problems may be experienced too. Children who have this version are also more vulnerable to seizures. Non-spastic (Extrapyramidial) Cerebral Palsy\nWhile the muscles do not involuntarily contract or twist with this form of axatic cerebral palsy, speech problems, motor skill challenge and respiratory issues are still present. Periventricular Leukomalacia Cerebral Palsy\nChildren with this version of cerebral palsy may have some difficulties with their muscles, but it mainly affects their brain. They are more likely to experience seizures than with other forms and may develop epilepsy. A child that has spastic quadriplegia will lack control of their limbs. Developmental milestones, therefore, will take a lot longer to reach. Sadly, the path to these developmental markers may also be quite painful.",

            "passage": "When a newborn is diagnosed with a birth injury it can impact every member of your family. Understanding these impacts, understanding your coping mechanisms, and understanding what options your family has available are all important for helping your family heal, manage, and start to move on. In many cases, birth injuries will have lifelong effects. These effects can impact the family in a variety of different ways. While the financial impacts are often the most immediate, and the most tangible, the emotional and psychological impacts can affect all family members’ lives as well. For families, the financial costs of a birth injury can be substantial. While health insurance might cover your child’s medical needs to an extent, most families will incur medical bills, and many families will not be able to afford to pay what they owe. For example, today, the lifetime costs of care for a newborn diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) can climb to well above one million dollars. This is a comparable cost to many other birth injury diagnoses. Families can face other financial costs as a result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. For example, parents will often need to miss significant time from work in order to take their children to doctor’s appointments and provide at-home care. Ultimately parents may decide that it is best for one of them to leave their job and stay home full-time. Even then it may be necessary to hire at-home help ranging from nurses and therapists to landscapers and cleaners. Depending on a child’s specific diagnosis parents may also need to incur costs for home and vehicle modifications. These costs might be immediate or they might become necessary as the child grows. Similarly, while a child who has been diagnosed with a birth injury may need a certain type of care initially, over time, his or her needs may shift to require the engagement of therapists, social workers, tutors, and other specialists. As a result, when planning for their financial needs, parents must consider more than just their current medical expenses. They must consider the other financial impacts of their child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. Some families may need to scale back in other areas and many will need to seek financial assistance—whether now or in the future. A birth injury can also have emotional and psychological impacts on all members of the family. Generally speaking, these impacts will be different for the parents, the child’s siblings, and the child. As a parent, learning that your child has been diagnosed with a life-altering birth injury can be heartbreaking. It can take time to come to terms with your child’s diagnosis and your family’s situation and you may need time to grieve. While grieving can be both healthy and necessary parents should also consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist. It is important to be able to cope effectively while still being present in the family’s day-to-day life. Anxiety and depression are not uncommon among parents whose children have been diagnosed with birth injuries. Parents may also experience hypertension and other physical effects. As a parent, as you begin to cope, it will be important to be aware of the signs that you may need to consult with a doctor. The financial stress that many families experience as the result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis can also lead to emotional and psychological strain. The stress of coping with your family’s situation can strain many couples’ relationships as well. Again, it is important to recognize that these are possibilities and to seek professional help when necessary. Having a brother or sister with a birth injury can also be emotionally difficult. Young children may not understand how or why their sibling is different, and this confusion can impact how they process their own personal circumstances as they grow. Children can also find it difficult if their parents spend more time or devote more attention to their sibling—even if this is due to their sibling’s unique needs. Unfortunately, children can also experience impacts in their social lives. Even at relatively young ages, children can face bullying or ostracization as the result of having a brother or sister who is different. These can have their own psychological effects; and, as a result, parents may need to watch for signs of childhood anxiety and depression as well. Lastly, a birth injury impacts the child who has been diagnosed. In addition to the direct cognitive effects of the birth injury itself, growing up with a birth injury can have significant emotional and psychological consequences. This is particularly true once children begin to see how they are different from their peers—and this can begin to happen at a relatively young age.",

            "passage": "Cerebral palsy in adults can present many unique and unresolved challenges. Medical professionals do not yet have a clear view of how to manage all the issues relevant to an individual with cerebral palsy. Health problems such as arthritis, strained organs, and fatigue can plague patients as they grow older. The disease can affect a person's ability to work or care for him or herself, and aging parents and family members may no longer be available for intensive assistance and care. Ongoing research in the field provides physicians, patients, and their families with hope for new treatments and therapies. A better understanding of the disease will serve to address many of the challenges faced by cerebral palsy in adults. A person diagnosed with cerebral palsy most often experiences an extreme strain on the systems of his or her body. Premature aging is normal and frequently seen in adults with this condition by the time they reach the age of 40. Organs like the heart and lungs may not have developed fully, and have spent decades working in overdrive to respond to the demands of the body. Arthritis is also commonly associated with cerebral palsy in adults, due to years of disproportionate joint compression and a limited range of motion. Cerebral palsy in adults can cause fatigue that interferes with the individual's ability to work or care for him or herself. The complications associated with cerebral palsy and growing older, like premature aging and arthritis, can be draining and difficult to live with. Additionally, the simple act of moving around requires a person living with this disease to exert three to five times the amount of energy as an average person. This extreme strain can limit a person's ability to work in traditional employment. A person affected by cerebral palsy may have had a large support system as a child. Parents are usually available and involved in the upbringing of a child with a developmental or physical illness, and cerebral palsy is no exception. One challenge that occurs with cerebral palsy in adults is the aging of the patient's parents and family. The individual's parents may no longer be living, or could be handling their own medical issues related to aging. Cerebral palsy support groups can be instrumental in assisting an adult living with the disease. Without support, it can be difficult for the person to navigate issues like employment, health care, insurance, and living arrangements. Group homes are an option for people who suffer from severe cerebral palsy, and require daily, hands-on assistance with self-care and feeding.",

            "passage": "The Top Cerebral Palsy Myths\nMany myths about cerebral palsy (CP) persist despite enormous advocacy efforts. These myths also put undue stress on parents and other family members of children with CP. The following list clears up 17 of the most pervasive myths about cerebral palsy:\nCP is a progressive condition. This misconception may come from the confusion of CP with certain neurological disorders, such as Tay–Sachs disease, that are degenerative. Those disorders worsen as the patient gets older. In contrast, cerebral palsy symptoms do not generally increase in severity and instead may actually improve over time. Continued research into surgical options and other therapeutic strategies has made the latter scenario more common in recent years. People with CP can’t live independently. It is true that some people with cerebral palsy need to be cared for their entire lives through family and caregiver support. However, many adults with CP are independent, while others may still require some help. Adults with CP who live independently may make use of the following strategies:\n- Assistive technologies, including mobility aids and transfer equipment. - Modifications to the home and workplace, such as lower countertops for wheelchair users. - Personal care assistance for potentially difficult tasks, such as household chores. Children with Cerebral Palsy can’t communicate. While children with cerebral palsy are more likely to also have language disorders and hearing impairments, many do not. And, those who do have challenges may overcome them through speech therapy and the use of communication devices. Children with CP are intellectually disabled. It is important to remember that, while a neurological disorder, CP is fundamentally a problem with motor function. Still, as many as half of children with CP also have some level of cognitive impairment. This ranges from very mild to severe intellectual disability. Children with CP are also more likely than the general population to have learning disabilities — which are distinct from intellectual disabilities. CP is the same for everyone. CP is actually an umbrella term for a diverse group of neurological disorders that may involve very different symptoms. The four main types of CP are:\n- Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Pyramidal)\n- Athetoid Cerebral Palsy (Extrapyramidal or Dyskinetic)\n- Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n- Mixed Cerebral Palsy\nAnd within each is a wide range of symptoms and severities. For example, one child with spastic CP might have trouble controlling a single arm, while another child with the same condition may have quadriplegia with all four limbs severely affected. Your child’s specific needs and challenges will be unique. Colleges do not accommodate students with Cerebral Palsy. It is increasingly common for young adults with cerebral palsy to pursue a college education. In the US, colleges that receive federal funding — the vast majority of institutions of higher education — are legally required to make accommodations for all disabled students, including those with CP. Even many colleges that don’t receive federal funding often voluntarily offer assistance to students with CP. Accommodations may include following the recommendations outlined in a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), as well as ensuring accessibility to campus facilities. Having CP won’t prevent your child from receiving a quality education. Cerebral Palsy is always caused by medical malpractice. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly following a child’s birth. It could also be due to a condition that results in the brain failing to develop properly. This may be mediated by injury, inflammation, or a lack of oxygen. While it’s true that some cases of CP may be caused by medical malpractice, many are not. Common causes of CP include:\n- Serious maternal infection during pregnancy. - Brain infections after birth, such as meningitis. - Birth complications. - Head trauma. - Congenital disorders, such as heart defects and issues with blood clotting. - Medication errors. - Maternal substance abuse\nFactors that increase the risk for CP include:\n- Premature birth. - Low birth weight. - Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets). - Certain infertility treatments, which increase the chance of having multiple births. - Maternal health conditions, such as seizures and thyroid disorders. Parenting a child with CP is overwhelming.",

            "passage": "When being diagnosed for any condition, disease or illness, it is essential to the effectiveness of the treatment that this is received as soon as possible. When such a diagnosis is “delayed,” the result can be extremely detrimental. This is true for cerebral palsy as well as other disabling conditions. When seeking a diagnosis of a condition, parents and caretakers should make sure diagnosticians are focused on the case at hand. When hospital workloads or scheduling are inefficient, a delayed diagnosis can be the result. Here are some important suggestions for obtaining an early diagnosis. According to Frederick B. Palmer MD, methods for early cerebral palsy diagnosis include a large variety of measures of the underlying brain dysfunctions alongside their neurodevelopmental reactions. These can be categorized into the following three areas: functional confinement; impairment and pathogenesis. One of the best techniques for measuring pathogenesis to diagnose cerebral palsy in the preterm and term infant, is neuroimaging. Neurological impairment is measured vis-à-vis muscle tone, reflexes and other similar indications. What makes a diagnosis tricky with babies is that these are not all that predictive in the first few months of life. A baby’s neurological system is not yet completely developed at this point. In most cases, therefore, a diagnosis using neuroimaging can only be determined after the baby reaches six months. Nonetheless, parents should understand that if a newborn of 16-20 weeks displays abnormal spontaneous general movements along with functional impediments in this time period, these have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. One way parents can improve their chances of obtaining an early diagnosis of cerebral palsy for their child is by detecting abnormal spontaneous movements. Usually, this is caught in conjunction with an organized follow-up program and development surveillance. Parents concerned that their child may have cerebral palsy and those who are looking for the earliest diagnosis possible, should look for the following: muscle tone variations (too stiff or too flexible); exaggerated reflexes; stiffness with normal reflexes; problematic muscle coordination; tremors\/involuntary movements; slow, writhing movements; motor skill milestone achievement like crawling, sitting up etc. ; a preference for one side of the body; problems walking (which may be seen through a child walking on their tiptoes); difficulty swallowing or excessive drooling; difficulty eating\/sucking; speech delays, etc. While cerebral palsy is a very challenging condition with which to live, the earlier the diagnosis, the better level of treatment and hope for integrating into a normal life the child will have. Obviously, the prevalence of one or more of these conditions does not mean that the child has cerebral palsy. It does mean, however, that there is a red flag that should certainly send parents to a doctor for further evaluations.",

    "answer": "Nicotine consumption can have adverse effects on the health of intervertebral discs in the human body. Nicotine, the primary addictive substance found in tobacco products, has been linked to a higher risk of intervertebral disc degeneration. This is particularly relevant to the cervical spine, as highlighted by a study from Emory University.\n\nThe study suggests that nicotine can damage the microvasculature system, which is responsible for nourishing the intervertebral discs. By constricting blood vessels, nicotine reduces the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the discs, contributing to their degeneration. This degeneration can lead to conditions such as cervical degenerative disc disease, which is characterized by chronic neck pain and reduced disc height.\n\nThe degeneration process is exacerbated because intervertebral discs do not have a direct blood supply; instead, they rely on nutrient diffusion from surrounding tissues. When this process is compromised by nicotine-induced vasoconstriction, the discs are more susceptible to damage and less able to heal.\n\nFurthermore, smoking has been associated with increased pressure on the intervertebral discs, which can accelerate the degeneration process. This added pressure, coupled with the reduced nutrient supply, can lead to a vicious cycle of disc damage and further degeneration.\n\nIn summary, nicotine consumption can negatively affect the health of intervertebral discs by reducing their nutrient supply, increasing pressure on the discs, and promoting degeneration. These effects can lead to chronic pain and mobility issues in the affected areas of the spine.",

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption. Smoking cessation is highly advisable with positive effects on the bone metabolism on the long term. More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.\n\nFacts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.\n\nThe Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.\n\n- Lumbar disc herniation is a common cause of lower back pain and can result from age-related degeneration, physical trauma, genetic predisposition, or lifestyle factors. - Symptoms include lower back pain, sciatica, and numbness or tingling in the legs. - Treatment options range from conservative approaches like rest, medication, and physical therapy to alternative treatments like chiropractic care and acupuncture. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary. - Prevention strategies include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, proper lifting techniques, and good posture. - A comprehensive, customized treatment plan can help individuals overcome lumbar disc herniation and return to their favorite activities pain-free. Anatomy and Physiology\nOur spine is a fascinating and complex structure that plays a crucial role in supporting our bodies and allowing us to move freely. To better understand how injuries to the discs occur, it's essential first to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spine. Structure of the Spine\nOur spine is made up of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. These vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers and provide flexibility to the spine. The vertebrae are the individual bones that make up the spine. They are divided into different regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. Each vertebra is a uniquely shaped bone that provides support and stability to the spine. The vertebrae are connected by facet joints, allowing smooth and controlled movements. The vertebral column also serves as the protective canal for the spinal cord, which transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Intervertebral discs are the spongy, cartilaginous pads found between the vertebrae. They are composed of an outer fibrous ring called the annulus fibrosus and an inner gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. Functions of the Intervertebral Discs\nIntervertebral discs play two primary roles in the overall function and health of the spine:\nOne of the primary functions of the intervertebral discs is to act as a shock absorber for the spine during everyday activities. This shock-absorbing capacity helps protect the vertebrae and prevent injuries. However, the discs can wear down over time, making them less effective at absorbing shock. This wear and tear can increase the risk of conditions like lumbar disc herniation. What Is A Lumbar Disc Herniation? A lumbar disc herniation occurs when the outer layer of an intervertebral disc tears, allowing the soft inner material to bulge or leak out. This can cause nerve compression and pain, numbness, or weakness. Here are the common causes:\nAs we age, the intervertebral discs lose some water content and become less flexible. This process, known as disc degeneration, can make the discs more susceptible to tearing and herniation. Age-related degeneration is a common cause of lumbar disc herniation, highlighting the significance of preserving a healthy spine throughout one's life. Physical Trauma or Injury\nSudden physical trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports injury, can cause damage to the intervertebral discs and lead to lumbar disc herniation. In these cases, prompt treatment is crucial to minimize long-term damage and prevent chronic pain. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to lumbar disc herniation, and research has found several inherited factors that affect intervertebral disc structure and strength. While you cannot change your genetics, understanding your family history can help you take proactive measures to protect your spine and reduce the risk of herniation. Several lifestyle factors can contribute to lumbar disc herniation, including:\nA sedentary lifestyle can weaken the muscles that support the spine. That lack of stabilizer strength increases pressure on the intervertebral discs, resulting in a higher risk of herniation. Physical activity and targeted exercises can help maintain a strong and healthy spine. Poor posture can place additional stress on the intervertebral discs and increase the risk of herniation. It can be static (think sitting or standing) or dynamic (think how you lift things). Excess body weight can put extra pressure on the intervertebral discs, making them more prone to damage and herniation.\n\nWhen you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)\n\n- We strive to provide complete care for our patients. Learn more about all the services we provide. Your Spine 101\nAn adult human spine typically consists of 26 moveable segments: seven cervical vertebras, twelve thoracic vertebras, five lumbar vertebras, one sacrum, and one coccyx (tailbone). Intervertebral discs separate the segments from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum and a thinner disc is present between the sacrum and coccyx. Intervertebral discs comprise about 25% of the height of an adult spine. Intervertebral joints connect vertebras and these joints are lined by lubricating synovial membranes. All of these structures are designed and built to last a lifetime. Intervertebral discs, which are gel-like colloids, begin to lose their water content at about age 2. This slow resorption is perfectly normal. Nothing lasts forever, and all living structures degrade and deteriorate over time. With this in mind, we can understand how it is that x-rays of older persons show various degrees of degeneration or arthritis of the spinal joints and intervertebral discs. These physiological changes are ominously or portentously referred to as \"degenerative disc disease\" by certain specialists, but it is important to remember that these structures deteriorate naturally. Degeneration or breakdown of spinal joints and intervertebral discs is not a disease, but rather a standard process that occurs over time, more rapidly in some persons than in others. There are measures we can employ to resist the effects of spinal degenerative changes and possibly even slow the process of degeneration itself. Spinal degenerative changes are problematic as they result in loss of resilience, flexibility, and mobility of the spine as a whole. The overall result is degradation of spinal function and increased possibility for strains, sprains, and other injuries. Solutions are available, as research studies have consistently demonstrated that regular vigorous exercise and healthy nutrition provide significant benefit in maintaining spinal structure and function. Regular vigorous exercise such as walking, running, bike riding, and strength training provide consistent weight bearing stress to spinal joints and intervertebral discs. Such mechanical stresses are required for these structures to retain their physiological integrity. For example, exercise pumps fluid back into intervertebral discs and increases lubrication of spinal joints. Healthy eating provides the nutrients required to support efficient repair and replacement of the cells and tissues of spinal structural components. Thus, by choosing to implement healthy lifestyles, we help keep our spines in peak physical condition and become better able to withstand the negative effects of natural physiological forces occurring over time. Having a healthy spine also depends on getting regular chiropractic care. Exercise, good nutrition, and sufficient rest are the primary requirements for spinal health, but there may be limitations and restrictions in the form of spinal joint dysfunction and nerve interference. These limitations prevent your spine from achieving optimal function and may lead to stiffness, loss of mobility, ongoing pain, and even injury. By detecting and correcting spinal joint dysfunction, regular chiropractic care helps eliminate sources of nerve interference and enables your spine to do its job, which includes handling heavy mechanical loads and moving you around during all your activities throughout the day. Regular chiropractic care partners with your other healthy lifestyle choices to help you achieve high levels of health and well-being now and into the future. - Geusens PP, van den Bergh JP: Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: shared mechanisms and epidemiology.

The spine is basically a stack of bones called the vertebrae that are connected by facet joints and cushioned by the intervertebral discs. These parts work together to protect the spinal cord and support and move the upper body. If you are suffering from neck or back pain from a disc-related condition, getting an overview of the underlying causes can help you and your doctor develop a treatment plan that can get you back to regular activities. Overview of disc conditions\nIntervertebral discs are vulnerable to a number of problems because they endure a significant amount of wear and tear. Discs can become damaged as a result of an injury or trauma to the spine. Actions like heavy lifting, repetitive use of poor body mechanics or sudden twisting movements can increase your chances of incurring intervertebral disc damage that leads to conditions such as:\n- Bulging discs — This occurs when the disc weakens or degenerates and protrudes into the spinal canal. - Herniated discs — This is when the outer layer of a disc ruptures and inner material leaks out\n- Bone spurs — Weakened discs can increase pressure on the vertebrae, causing bone-on-bone contact. Bone spurs are a natural response to increase stability. - Degenerative disc disease — This condition is a general term for age-related disc deterioration that happens when reduced blood flow causes disc material to dehydrate and lose elasticity. All of these conditions can cause a restricted range of motion in the spine leading to symptoms, including local back stiffness and pain, as well as radiating pain, weakness and numbness in the extremities. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you may have intervertebral disc damage that is causing nerve compression. Treating intervertebral discs\nUpon diagnosis, most physicians or spine specialists will begin treatment with a course of conservative pain management options like massage therapy, hot and cold compression and pain medication. More advanced treatments like epidural steroid injections and physical therapy can also be pursued. Traditional open back surgery is often viewed as a last-resort when weeks or months of conservative options don’t bring needed relief. Laser Spine Institute is the leader in minimally invasive outpatient spine surgery, which is an alternative to the hospitalization and long recovery periods associated with traditional procedures. If you have exhausted conservative treatment and are considering surgery, contact Laser Spine Institute today for a no-cost MRI review* to see if you may be a candidate for one of our procedures.\n\nNicotine is usually associated with tobacco cigarettes and it is probably why it enjoys such a negative reputation. Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.\n\nQuestion:How does nicotine consumption affect the health of intervertebral discs in the human body?",

            "passage": "(RxWiki News) It’s a well-known fact — cigarettes are bad for your health. Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Intervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. On average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not. \"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\" The study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA. Research presented at conferences may not have been peer-reviewed. Information on funding sources and conflicts of interest was not available at the time of publication.",

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system.

The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.",

            "passage": "Facts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.",

            "passage": "The Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.",

In severe cases, surgery may be necessary. - Prevention strategies include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, proper lifting techniques, and good posture. - A comprehensive, customized treatment plan can help individuals overcome lumbar disc herniation and return to their favorite activities pain-free. Anatomy and Physiology\nOur spine is a fascinating and complex structure that plays a crucial role in supporting our bodies and allowing us to move freely. To better understand how injuries to the discs occur, it's essential first to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spine. Structure of the Spine\nOur spine is made up of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. These vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers and provide flexibility to the spine. The vertebrae are the individual bones that make up the spine. They are divided into different regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. Each vertebra is a uniquely shaped bone that provides support and stability to the spine. The vertebrae are connected by facet joints, allowing smooth and controlled movements. The vertebral column also serves as the protective canal for the spinal cord, which transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Intervertebral discs are the spongy, cartilaginous pads found between the vertebrae. They are composed of an outer fibrous ring called the annulus fibrosus and an inner gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. Functions of the Intervertebral Discs\nIntervertebral discs play two primary roles in the overall function and health of the spine:\nOne of the primary functions of the intervertebral discs is to act as a shock absorber for the spine during everyday activities. This shock-absorbing capacity helps protect the vertebrae and prevent injuries. However, the discs can wear down over time, making them less effective at absorbing shock. This wear and tear can increase the risk of conditions like lumbar disc herniation. What Is A Lumbar Disc Herniation? A lumbar disc herniation occurs when the outer layer of an intervertebral disc tears, allowing the soft inner material to bulge or leak out. This can cause nerve compression and pain, numbness, or weakness. Here are the common causes:\nAs we age, the intervertebral discs lose some water content and become less flexible. This process, known as disc degeneration, can make the discs more susceptible to tearing and herniation. Age-related degeneration is a common cause of lumbar disc herniation, highlighting the significance of preserving a healthy spine throughout one's life. Physical Trauma or Injury\nSudden physical trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports injury, can cause damage to the intervertebral discs and lead to lumbar disc herniation. In these cases, prompt treatment is crucial to minimize long-term damage and prevent chronic pain. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to lumbar disc herniation, and research has found several inherited factors that affect intervertebral disc structure and strength. While you cannot change your genetics, understanding your family history can help you take proactive measures to protect your spine and reduce the risk of herniation. Several lifestyle factors can contribute to lumbar disc herniation, including:\nA sedentary lifestyle can weaken the muscles that support the spine. That lack of stabilizer strength increases pressure on the intervertebral discs, resulting in a higher risk of herniation. Physical activity and targeted exercises can help maintain a strong and healthy spine. Poor posture can place additional stress on the intervertebral discs and increase the risk of herniation. It can be static (think sitting or standing) or dynamic (think how you lift things). Excess body weight can put extra pressure on the intervertebral discs, making them more prone to damage and herniation.",

After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.",

            "passage": "In the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)",

            "passage": "- We strive to provide complete care for our patients. Learn more about all the services we provide. Your Spine 101\nAn adult human spine typically consists of 26 moveable segments: seven cervical vertebras, twelve thoracic vertebras, five lumbar vertebras, one sacrum, and one coccyx (tailbone). Intervertebral discs separate the segments from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum and a thinner disc is present between the sacrum and coccyx. Intervertebral discs comprise about 25% of the height of an adult spine. Intervertebral joints connect vertebras and these joints are lined by lubricating synovial membranes. All of these structures are designed and built to last a lifetime. Intervertebral discs, which are gel-like colloids, begin to lose their water content at about age 2. This slow resorption is perfectly normal. Nothing lasts forever, and all living structures degrade and deteriorate over time. With this in mind, we can understand how it is that x-rays of older persons show various degrees of degeneration or arthritis of the spinal joints and intervertebral discs. These physiological changes are ominously or portentously referred to as \"degenerative disc disease\" by certain specialists, but it is important to remember that these structures deteriorate naturally. Degeneration or breakdown of spinal joints and intervertebral discs is not a disease, but rather a standard process that occurs over time, more rapidly in some persons than in others. There are measures we can employ to resist the effects of spinal degenerative changes and possibly even slow the process of degeneration itself. Spinal degenerative changes are problematic as they result in loss of resilience, flexibility, and mobility of the spine as a whole. The overall result is degradation of spinal function and increased possibility for strains, sprains, and other injuries. Solutions are available, as research studies have consistently demonstrated that regular vigorous exercise and healthy nutrition provide significant benefit in maintaining spinal structure and function. Regular vigorous exercise such as walking, running, bike riding, and strength training provide consistent weight bearing stress to spinal joints and intervertebral discs. Such mechanical stresses are required for these structures to retain their physiological integrity. For example, exercise pumps fluid back into intervertebral discs and increases lubrication of spinal joints. Healthy eating provides the nutrients required to support efficient repair and replacement of the cells and tissues of spinal structural components. Thus, by choosing to implement healthy lifestyles, we help keep our spines in peak physical condition and become better able to withstand the negative effects of natural physiological forces occurring over time. Having a healthy spine also depends on getting regular chiropractic care. Exercise, good nutrition, and sufficient rest are the primary requirements for spinal health, but there may be limitations and restrictions in the form of spinal joint dysfunction and nerve interference. These limitations prevent your spine from achieving optimal function and may lead to stiffness, loss of mobility, ongoing pain, and even injury. By detecting and correcting spinal joint dysfunction, regular chiropractic care helps eliminate sources of nerve interference and enables your spine to do its job, which includes handling heavy mechanical loads and moving you around during all your activities throughout the day. Regular chiropractic care partners with your other healthy lifestyle choices to help you achieve high levels of health and well-being now and into the future. - Geusens PP, van den Bergh JP: Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: shared mechanisms and epidemiology.

The spine is basically a stack of bones called the vertebrae that are connected by facet joints and cushioned by the intervertebral discs. These parts work together to protect the spinal cord and support and move the upper body. If you are suffering from neck or back pain from a disc-related condition, getting an overview of the underlying causes can help you and your doctor develop a treatment plan that can get you back to regular activities. Overview of disc conditions\nIntervertebral discs are vulnerable to a number of problems because they endure a significant amount of wear and tear. Discs can become damaged as a result of an injury or trauma to the spine. Actions like heavy lifting, repetitive use of poor body mechanics or sudden twisting movements can increase your chances of incurring intervertebral disc damage that leads to conditions such as:\n- Bulging discs — This occurs when the disc weakens or degenerates and protrudes into the spinal canal. - Herniated discs — This is when the outer layer of a disc ruptures and inner material leaks out\n- Bone spurs — Weakened discs can increase pressure on the vertebrae, causing bone-on-bone contact. Bone spurs are a natural response to increase stability. - Degenerative disc disease — This condition is a general term for age-related disc deterioration that happens when reduced blood flow causes disc material to dehydrate and lose elasticity. All of these conditions can cause a restricted range of motion in the spine leading to symptoms, including local back stiffness and pain, as well as radiating pain, weakness and numbness in the extremities. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you may have intervertebral disc damage that is causing nerve compression. Treating intervertebral discs\nUpon diagnosis, most physicians or spine specialists will begin treatment with a course of conservative pain management options like massage therapy, hot and cold compression and pain medication. More advanced treatments like epidural steroid injections and physical therapy can also be pursued. Traditional open back surgery is often viewed as a last-resort when weeks or months of conservative options don’t bring needed relief. Laser Spine Institute is the leader in minimally invasive outpatient spine surgery, which is an alternative to the hospitalization and long recovery periods associated with traditional procedures. If you have exhausted conservative treatment and are considering surgery, contact Laser Spine Institute today for a no-cost MRI review* to see if you may be a candidate for one of our procedures.",

            "passage": "Nicotine is usually associated with tobacco cigarettes and it is probably why it enjoys such a negative reputation. Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.",

Or have you ever found the perfect sport coat on eBay or Style Forum, but it didn’t have size tags and the seller simply listed the measurements? I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let’s make sure this never happens to you again. Here’s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes: Lucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it’ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor’s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below: Here are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones: Sleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement This is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight It’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad You want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad Yes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up Hold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so: Pretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes Let’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly. Take the jacket’s measurements. This will come in handy when you’re looking to buy suiting online. Measuring a garment is similar to measuring your body, but easier. You’re essentially taking the same measurements you would on yourself. Lay your garment on a flat surface, and follow this measuring guide: (need the full size version? click here.) BOOM!

    "answer": "To ensure accuracy when measuring body parts for clothing, follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Use a flexible measuring tape:** Tailor's tape, which is flexible and non-stretchable, is ideal for body measurements.\n\n2. **Stand straight:** Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed. This helps avoid distorted measurements due to poor posture.\n\n3. **Take measurements while breathing normally:** For most measurements, take them without holding your breath or tightening your stomach muscles. This gives a more accurate representation of your body's natural shape.\n\n4. **Position the tape correctly:**\n   - **Chest\/Bust:** Place the measuring tape around the fullest part of your bust, usually under your armpits. For a woman, it's the fullest part of the bust; for a man, it's the fullest part of the chest, taken horizontally under the armpits.\n   - **Waist:** Find the narrowest part of your waist, typically just above the belly button. Place the tape level around your body, parallel to the ground, without pulling it too tight.\n   - **Hips:** Measure around the fullest part of your hips, usually at the widest point, which is typically a few inches below the waistline. Ensure the tape is parallel to the floor.\n   - **Length (e.g., inseam):** Measure from the top of the shoulder to the wrist for sleeve length, or from the waist to the floor for pant length, ensuring the tape follows the natural curve of the body.\n\n5. **Keep the tape snug but not tight:** It should be relaxed but still touch your skin or the clothing you're wearing without compressing it.\n\n6. **Record measurements accurately:** Note down each measurement carefully, using the correct units (inches or centimeters). \n\n7. **Compare with size charts:** Use the measurements to compare with clothing size charts. Remember, different brands may have different interpretations of these measurements.\n\n8. **Consider the fit preference:** Some people prefer their clothes to fit snugly, while others like a looser fit. Adjust the tension of the tape accordingly.\n\nFollowing these guidelines helps ensure that your measurements are accurate, allowing you to choose clothing that fits properly and comfortably.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: If you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the “natural waist” for their size guides.

When taking your body measurements, wear the undergarments you normally wear for the most accurate results. Use a flexible tape measure, or a piece of string and ruler, and hold it around each body point so it is comfortably snug. If the tape is cutting into your flesh, it is too tight. To ensure an accurate measurement around your body, keep the measuring tape as level as possible from front to back. We recommend measuring yourself in front of a mirror so you can check this from a side view. If you can, get a friend to help you to ensure the most accurate measurements. Bust: Wrap the measuring tape around your back and where the tape meets across the fullest point of your bust is your bust measurement. Waist: Wrap the measuring tape around your natural waist, the slimmest part of your torso, pulling the ends to the front. Where they meet is your waist measurement. Hips: Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your bottom – this is usually low down towards your thighs. As with your bust and waist measurements, where the tape meets is your hip measurement. Length: To measure the length of individual garments against your body it is best to measure down the centre of your back. To do this, start the measuring tape at either the base of your neck for dresses and tops, or at your waist for skirts. Measure down your body to the measurement listed in the garment description. This will show you where the garment comes to on you. When you are measuring for length, remember to make sure you are standing completely upright – it is best to have someone help you with this. Alternatively, compare the measurement with the length of a garment you already have.

If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. • To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person’s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. • To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person’s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. • Measure the fullest part of the person’s hip. • To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy.\n\nThe best way is to find a freckle and use it every time. LOL! That's what I do. For record keeping, what matters most is consistency. As for measuring for clothing, I have no idea. I'm bad about the waist and the hips. Proper \"hip\" measurement for me seems more like my butt, not my hips. My hip bones are a lot higher than where I think my hips must actually be. Dr. Oz wants us to have a waist size of 32 or smaller and he allows for sucking in. I do not suck in, but that's just me. And I like to pull the tape pretty tight only because that way I can't second guess the way I do it each time. If I'm always pulling really tight then it's the same every time.\n\nHow many times have you stumbled upon a sweet deal online but never completed the purchase because you couldn’t figure out if the last one in your size would actually fit (and there were no returns, no exchanges)? Or have you ever found the perfect sport coat on eBay or Style Forum, but it didn’t have size tags and the seller simply listed the measurements? I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let’s make sure this never happens to you again. Here’s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes:\nLucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it’ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor’s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below:\nHere are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones:\nSleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement\nThis is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight\nIt’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad\nYou want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad\nYes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up\nHold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so:\nPretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes\nLet’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly.

Stand up straight and relax your abdominal muscles. Find your natural waist. An easy way to do this is to stand in front of the mirror and bend at your side. The crease that forms indicates your natural waistline, directly above the belly button and below the ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape completely around your waist starting at the belly button. Begin at the spot on the tape where the measure reads \"0.\" Make sure the tape is level around your waistline--not too loose, not too tight. Do not place the measuring tape over clothes. You'll get the most accurate results on bare skin. However, make sure the tape is not squeezing into your skin. The number that meets the \"0\" after you have circled your entire waist is your waist measurement. Remove the tape and jot down your measurement for future reference. You may want to take your measurements in front of a full-length mirror to ensure you are measuring the right area and that the measuring tape isn't crooked. A healthy waistline for a woman is between 32 and 23 inches. For a man, it's between 45 and 32 inches. Make sure you use body measuring tape, which is made of fabric or bendable plastic. This will ensure more accurate results.\n\nFREE EXPRESS SHIPPING OVER $80 | SIGN UP TO VIP FOR $20 VOUCHER\n20% OFF FULL PRICE SLEEPWEAR + LOUNGE\nIN STORE & ONLINE\n30% KNITWEAR, TOPS & DENIM JEANS\nTAKE A FURTHER 50% OFF SALEIN STORE & ONLINE\nAt Sussan, we want to ensure that all your purchase fit and look great.

By Samantha Eckert\nIf you do decide to shop, make it easier on yourself by knowing your measurements before you try on or order show clothes. With show clothing, it is important that everything fits correctly. If something is too tight or loose, it can compromise your overall appearance in the show pen. Buy a flexible measuring tape from your local craft or fabric store for the most accurate numbers. When measuring yourself, wear the same undergarments that you show in. Enlist the help of a friend to take the most accurate measurements. Be sure to write them all down and keep them with you while you are shopping. Learn Nicole Barnes’ secrets to perfect showmanship patterns in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report! Where to Measure\nThe basic measurements women will need to find a well-fitted jacket are: waist, bust, neck, hips, front width and back waist. It is important when measuring to not pull to tightly on the measuring tape. This is called a skin measurement. Stand relaxed, but with good posture. Start with your waist. Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding. Your front width is from the crease where the arm meets the body to the crease on the other side, above the breasts and not across the fullest part. The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket. To measure your back waist, put the measuring tape at the nape of your neck. Then, measure the distance to where you would like your jacket to end. Showmanship jackets should end at the fullest part of your hips, anything longer will make your legs look short. Your hips are measured around the fullest part of your bottom with the tape parallel to the floor. For riding jackets you need to know where your chaps fit while you are mounted and riding. It is popular to have jackets that can be worn in multiple classes. If you are looking for a versatile jacket, be sure to know whether you want to wear it tucked in or left out while showing in riding classes. If you plan on wearing the jacket tucked in, be sure it is long enough that it will not un-tuck while riding and moving. If you plan on wearing the jacket un-tucked, it needs to fit over your chaps or hit just above them to show your belt buckle. Here are the top 24 photos we’ve picked for the AQHA calendar contest.

How do the first four measurements to be compiled to the ONLY 1 measurement \"Body Width\" in the chart? ShirtSpace08\/18\/2022 05:13 pm\nHi, Ninh! We feel your pain when it comes to trying to decipher size guides. To answer your question about how to measure for “body width”. When you see that on any size chart, the standard rule of thumb is that width is measured 1” below the armpit from seam to seam, laid flat. We hope this helps you find the perfect t-shirt you have been looking for! If you have any more questions, please feel free to reach out to our Customer Service Team, and I would be happy to assist further. R Moore10\/02\/2023 09:48 pm\nI’m confused. A small body width is 18” on the chart … measuring it as you describe equates to 1\/2 of circumference, which means a small is 36” chest size! That can’t be correct! ShirtSpace10\/02\/2023 10:52 pm\nHello! The body width would be measured 1\" below the armpit from side seam to seam. What you described is correct – the circumference is 36\". Bra sizes are often listed as this measurement, in accompaniment with a cup size. So, for instance, 36A is a bra size. This means the person's body width would likely measure at 18\", and their body circumference 36\". Shammy Peterson05\/12\/2021 12:06 am\nI found it helpful when you said that the key to making sure that you will buy clothes that fit your torso is measuring the width of your body.

I didn't learn the one thing I needed to know. ShirtSpace08\/18\/2022 04:24 pm\nHi, Sherry. You are right - the photo is slightly inaccurate. However, the written instructions within the article are correct, stating to start with one end of your measuring tape from the top edge of your neckline seam on the front of your body, and then pull all the way to the bottom of the front hem. We apologize that the graphic is slightly misleading and will work to resolve this inconsistency.

            "passage": "If you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms.

Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement\nThis is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight\nIt’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad\nYou want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad\nYes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up\nHold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so:\nPretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes\nLet’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly.

You can find out your waist measurement easily, in the comfort of your home. Strip down to your underwear before starting the waist-measuring process. Stand up straight and relax your abdominal muscles. Find your natural waist. An easy way to do this is to stand in front of the mirror and bend at your side. The crease that forms indicates your natural waistline, directly above the belly button and below the ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape completely around your waist starting at the belly button. Begin at the spot on the tape where the measure reads \"0.\" Make sure the tape is level around your waistline--not too loose, not too tight. Do not place the measuring tape over clothes. You'll get the most accurate results on bare skin. However, make sure the tape is not squeezing into your skin. The number that meets the \"0\" after you have circled your entire waist is your waist measurement. Remove the tape and jot down your measurement for future reference. You may want to take your measurements in front of a full-length mirror to ensure you are measuring the right area and that the measuring tape isn't crooked. A healthy waistline for a woman is between 32 and 23 inches. For a man, it's between 45 and 32 inches. Make sure you use body measuring tape, which is made of fabric or bendable plastic. This will ensure more accurate results.",

By Samantha Eckert\nIf you do decide to shop, make it easier on yourself by knowing your measurements before you try on or order show clothes. With show clothing, it is important that everything fits correctly. If something is too tight or loose, it can compromise your overall appearance in the show pen. Buy a flexible measuring tape from your local craft or fabric store for the most accurate numbers. When measuring yourself, wear the same undergarments that you show in. Enlist the help of a friend to take the most accurate measurements. Be sure to write them all down and keep them with you while you are shopping. Learn Nicole Barnes’ secrets to perfect showmanship patterns in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report! Where to Measure\nThe basic measurements women will need to find a well-fitted jacket are: waist, bust, neck, hips, front width and back waist. It is important when measuring to not pull to tightly on the measuring tape. This is called a skin measurement. Stand relaxed, but with good posture. Start with your waist. Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding. Your front width is from the crease where the arm meets the body to the crease on the other side, above the breasts and not across the fullest part. The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket. To measure your back waist, put the measuring tape at the nape of your neck. Then, measure the distance to where you would like your jacket to end. Showmanship jackets should end at the fullest part of your hips, anything longer will make your legs look short. Your hips are measured around the fullest part of your bottom with the tape parallel to the floor. For riding jackets you need to know where your chaps fit while you are mounted and riding. It is popular to have jackets that can be worn in multiple classes. If you are looking for a versatile jacket, be sure to know whether you want to wear it tucked in or left out while showing in riding classes. If you plan on wearing the jacket tucked in, be sure it is long enough that it will not un-tuck while riding and moving. If you plan on wearing the jacket un-tucked, it needs to fit over your chaps or hit just above them to show your belt buckle. Here are the top 24 photos we’ve picked for the AQHA calendar contest.

A small body width is 18” on the chart … measuring it as you describe equates to 1\/2 of circumference, which means a small is 36” chest size! That can’t be correct! ShirtSpace10\/02\/2023 10:52 pm\nHello! The body width would be measured 1\" below the armpit from side seam to seam. What you described is correct – the circumference is 36\". Bra sizes are often listed as this measurement, in accompaniment with a cup size. So, for instance, 36A is a bra size. This means the person's body width would likely measure at 18\", and their body circumference 36\".

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include: 2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles 3.

How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS. Our technicians are standing by to answer your questions, so you can see if you’re a candidate for TMS treatment.\n\n- Follow the schedule through until the very end. - Stay in touch with your doctor and report any side effects. - Talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you cope with any side effects or returning symptoms of depression or anxiety while you are tapering the medication. TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants? If you would like to stop or reduce the dosage of antidepressants you are taking, consult with your doctor.

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes in the brain that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, among others that are commonly found with antidepressant drugs. The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required. Sarkis Family Psychiatry typically delivers NeuroStar TMS Therapy 5 times per week for 50 minute sessions over 5-6 weeks, but it varies. Your treatment may be shorter or longer.\n\nMagnetic energy similar to what is used in an (MRI) is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that are sluggish and causing depressed mood. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of NeuroStar® TMS Therapy in treating patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant medication. NeuroStar TMS Therapy was studied in adult patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, all of whom had not received satisfactory improvement with previous treatments. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of the brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 19-37 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. It usually takes time for healthcare insurers to establish coverage policies for newly approved treatments such as NeuroStar TMS. However, many commercial and Medicare plans have recognized the effectiveness of treating depression with TMS Therapy and now cover TMS as part of their plans. See here for a full list of insurance plans that cover TMS. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were headache and scalp discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the popular use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells.\n\nTMS can improve depression symptoms in clients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to other depression treatments like antidepressant medications or talk therapy. It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.\n\nA Proven Non-drug Treatment\nMagnetic energy similar to what is used in an (MRI) is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that are sluggish and causing depressed mood.

These techniques differ radically from the popular use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells.\n\nWhile TMS Therapy has shown to be effective, not all patients will benefit from it. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, signs or symptoms of suicidal behavior, and\/or unusual behavior. Families and caregivers should also be aware of the need to observe patients and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen. Typically, the average course of TMS Therapy happens five times per week for exactly 37 minutes sessions over a 4-6 week timeframe. Any additional treatments are based on clinical judgment. No. While both show effective results for treating depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During a TMS treatment session, patients are sitting, awake and alert throughout the entire 37-minute procedure. This means that no sedation is required for TMS Therapy. Patients are able to transport themselves to and from their treatment. In contrast, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), commonly referred to as “shock therapy,” is meant to intentionally causes a seizure. Patients who receive ECT are sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. After the treatment, recovery occurs slowly, and patients are typically monitored under close supervision for minutes or a even few hours after a treatment. Patients often experience short-term confusion and memory loss after a ECT session. Even long-term memory disruptions have been reported and may persist indefinitely in some people. Significant caregiver supervision is often required after treatment, due to the side effects commonly associated with ECT. TMS is non-systemic, which means that it does not circulate in the blood throughout the body. Because it’s non-systemic, it does not have typical anti-depression medication side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate headache and scalp discomfort. Side effects typically occur less frequently after the first week of treatment. Yes! Transcranial magnetic stimulation is typically covered by most insurances. You can speak to one of our intake specialists to learn more about your specific plan. A TMS device sends short stimulating pulses of magnetic fields to the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. An electric current is produced by the magnetic field in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). The results show changes that may be beneficial in the treatment of depression. Initial treatment often lasts about 37 minutes, performed every day for about 4-6 weeks. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is commonly used to treat forms of depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine.\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) affects nearly eight percent of the population older than 12 years in the United States. It frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as one of the top causes of disability globally. Every day, people suffer from symptoms that cause difficulties in carrying out their activities of daily living. Thankfully, there are numerous pharmacological treatments, in addition to psychotherapy, that help many individuals lead normal lives. Unfortunately, for some individuals, their symptoms persist despite these treatments. If you are one of these individuals, you may benefit from non-medication-based interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. What Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS? Since its approval by the FDA in 2008, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an enticing treatment for depression. It is a non-invasive treatment that can be used by itself or in conjunction with psychotherapy and medication. Typically an electromagnetic coil is placed just above the left temple to deliver magnetic pulses. It helps stimulate cortical neurons to improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. The goal is to activate the areas of the brain with decreased activity that can be contributing to depression or other mental health symptoms. How Can I Determine if TMS Could Work for Me? Many factors go into treating depression, and a personalized treatment plan developed with a doctor is required to treat it effectively. Here are a couple of valuable points to consider when determining if TMS is right for you. ● Medication Side Effects\nMedications used to treat depression can have intolerable side effects such as sleep problems, GI upset, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. These side effects can have a minor impact on your daily life or can be debilitating in more extreme cases. On the other hand, TMS has little to no short-term side effects. The most common side effect reported has been scalp discomfort from the coil placement during the period of active stimulation. The worst side effect would be the occasional headaches that occur while acclimating to the stimulation and resolve shortly within starting treatment. There have been no long-term side effects reported due to TMS therapy other than continued relief from depression symptoms. ● No Relief\nMany medications treat depression and approximately half of patients will respond to the first antidepressant treatment. However, up to 40% of patients with depression do not experience relief from their symptoms with medications at all. Consequently, their diagnosis may change to treatment-resistant depression. If a patient has taken two or more full anti-depression medication courses as prescribed, they can be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They do need to take it at the full dose considered effective for the entire length of time, often up to 14 weeks. If you fall into this category, non-medication treatment routes should be explored, including TMS therapy. NeuroStim TMS treatment results are encouraging. Since 2018, NeuroStim TMS have performed over 65,000 successful TMS treatments and over 70% of our patients have experienced greater than 50% improvement in their depressive symptoms. Additionally, 46% have achieved full remission. Even if you are not diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, you may find that you only achieve partial relief from medication, and TMS can further improve symptoms. When used alongside psychotherapy, it often has the most significant impact to help develop coping strategies for your symptoms in these scenarios. While some medications are categorized as safe to be taken when pregnant, most patients planning to become pregnant need to discontinue their antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, this is a risk for the patient and her baby. TMS may be an excellent non-pharmacological option during this time. ● Medical History\nUnfortunately, if you have been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, you are not a candidate for TMS therapy due to the risks seizures pose. Additionally, if you have brain or neural implants, permanent metal in the body, or previous brain damage from illness or injury, TMS treatment may not be safe for you. Talk with your doctor about your medical history before beginning a course of treatment. If you have previously undergone TMS treatment and found it ineffective, that can change. As your depression, diagnosis, and body change, you may find you are more responsive to TMS therapy than in the past.\n\nTMS Therapy safety and tolerability\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy (TMS) is safe and easy to tolerate. Because it is not a depression drug, NeuroStar TMS Therapy does not have the same side effects that are associated with traditional antidepressant medications. More than 1.6 million treatments have been performed with NeuroStar, further proving its safety and tolerability record.5,12\nNeuroStar TMS Therapy Side Effects\nIn clinical trials, fewer than 5% of people discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The most common side effect was temporary pain or discomfort at or near the treatment site during therapy that usually resolves within the first week of treatment.1,2\nPeople should notify their doctor if they experience worsening depression symptoms, signs, or symptoms of suicidal behavior and\/or unusual behavior. Family members and support individuals should also be aware of the need to observe their loved ones and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen.5\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy (TMS) should not be used with people who have non-removable conductive metal or stimulator implants in or near the head or people who have active or inactive implants such as deep brain stimulators, cochlear implants, and vagus nerve stimulators.5\nIs TransformHealth right for you?\n\nQuestion:What are the common side effects associated with TMS treatment for depression?",

            "passage": "Side effects and medication option for TMS\nDepression is one of the leading causes of disability in the US among the people between 15-44 years of age. Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include:\n2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles\n3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation\nYou can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions:\nYou are pregnant or planning to get pregnant\nThere is an implanted medical device in the body\nYou have a history of seizures\nThere is brain damage from past injury or illness\nYou suffer from frequent headaches\nTo ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.",

TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them.

TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants?

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons).

The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required.

Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.",

Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of NeuroStar® TMS Therapy in treating patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant medication. NeuroStar TMS Therapy was studied in adult patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, all of whom had not received satisfactory improvement with previous treatments. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of the brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 19-37 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. It usually takes time for healthcare insurers to establish coverage policies for newly approved treatments such as NeuroStar TMS. However, many commercial and Medicare plans have recognized the effectiveness of treating depression with TMS Therapy and now cover TMS as part of their plans. See here for a full list of insurance plans that cover TMS. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were headache and scalp discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the popular use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells.",

Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, signs or symptoms of suicidal behavior, and\/or unusual behavior. Families and caregivers should also be aware of the need to observe patients and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen. Typically, the average course of TMS Therapy happens five times per week for exactly 37 minutes sessions over a 4-6 week timeframe. Any additional treatments are based on clinical judgment. No. While both show effective results for treating depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During a TMS treatment session, patients are sitting, awake and alert throughout the entire 37-minute procedure. This means that no sedation is required for TMS Therapy. Patients are able to transport themselves to and from their treatment. In contrast, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), commonly referred to as “shock therapy,” is meant to intentionally causes a seizure. Patients who receive ECT are sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. After the treatment, recovery occurs slowly, and patients are typically monitored under close supervision for minutes or a even few hours after a treatment. Patients often experience short-term confusion and memory loss after a ECT session. Even long-term memory disruptions have been reported and may persist indefinitely in some people. Significant caregiver supervision is often required after treatment, due to the side effects commonly associated with ECT. TMS is non-systemic, which means that it does not circulate in the blood throughout the body. Because it’s non-systemic, it does not have typical anti-depression medication side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate headache and scalp discomfort.

            "passage": "According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) affects nearly eight percent of the population older than 12 years in the United States. It frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as one of the top causes of disability globally. Every day, people suffer from symptoms that cause difficulties in carrying out their activities of daily living. Thankfully, there are numerous pharmacological treatments, in addition to psychotherapy, that help many individuals lead normal lives. Unfortunately, for some individuals, their symptoms persist despite these treatments. If you are one of these individuals, you may benefit from non-medication-based interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. What Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS? Since its approval by the FDA in 2008, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an enticing treatment for depression. It is a non-invasive treatment that can be used by itself or in conjunction with psychotherapy and medication. Typically an electromagnetic coil is placed just above the left temple to deliver magnetic pulses. It helps stimulate cortical neurons to improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. The goal is to activate the areas of the brain with decreased activity that can be contributing to depression or other mental health symptoms. How Can I Determine if TMS Could Work for Me? Many factors go into treating depression, and a personalized treatment plan developed with a doctor is required to treat it effectively. Here are a couple of valuable points to consider when determining if TMS is right for you. ● Medication Side Effects\nMedications used to treat depression can have intolerable side effects such as sleep problems, GI upset, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. These side effects can have a minor impact on your daily life or can be debilitating in more extreme cases. On the other hand, TMS has little to no short-term side effects. The most common side effect reported has been scalp discomfort from the coil placement during the period of active stimulation. The worst side effect would be the occasional headaches that occur while acclimating to the stimulation and resolve shortly within starting treatment. There have been no long-term side effects reported due to TMS therapy other than continued relief from depression symptoms. ● No Relief\nMany medications treat depression and approximately half of patients will respond to the first antidepressant treatment. However, up to 40% of patients with depression do not experience relief from their symptoms with medications at all. Consequently, their diagnosis may change to treatment-resistant depression. If a patient has taken two or more full anti-depression medication courses as prescribed, they can be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They do need to take it at the full dose considered effective for the entire length of time, often up to 14 weeks. If you fall into this category, non-medication treatment routes should be explored, including TMS therapy. NeuroStim TMS treatment results are encouraging. Since 2018, NeuroStim TMS have performed over 65,000 successful TMS treatments and over 70% of our patients have experienced greater than 50% improvement in their depressive symptoms. Additionally, 46% have achieved full remission. Even if you are not diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, you may find that you only achieve partial relief from medication, and TMS can further improve symptoms. When used alongside psychotherapy, it often has the most significant impact to help develop coping strategies for your symptoms in these scenarios. While some medications are categorized as safe to be taken when pregnant, most patients planning to become pregnant need to discontinue their antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, this is a risk for the patient and her baby. TMS may be an excellent non-pharmacological option during this time. ● Medical History\nUnfortunately, if you have been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, you are not a candidate for TMS therapy due to the risks seizures pose. Additionally, if you have brain or neural implants, permanent metal in the body, or previous brain damage from illness or injury, TMS treatment may not be safe for you. Talk with your doctor about your medical history before beginning a course of treatment. If you have previously undergone TMS treatment and found it ineffective, that can change. As your depression, diagnosis, and body change, you may find you are more responsive to TMS therapy than in the past.",

Born and raised in Morocco, he immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 13. He is the founder of Coke Boys Records, and its predecessor Cocaine City Records. In 2012, he signed a joint-venture recording deal with Bad Boy Records and Maybach Music Group. Kharbouch made his mixtape debut in 2007. In 2010, he had his breakthrough with \"Choppa Choppa Down\". He released his debut studio album Excuse My French on May 21, 2013. In July 2017, Montana released his second studio album, Jungle Rules, which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. The album was supported by the single \"Unforgettable\", featuring Swae Lee, which became Montana's first song as lead artist to reach the top 10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. He has also collaborated with a multitude of artists, such as Drake, Lil Wayne, The Weeknd, Young Thug, T.I., Chris Brown, among others. Karim Kharbouch (Arabic: ? Kar?m Kharb [kæ?i:m bu:?]) was born on November 9, 1984, in Casablanca, Morocco. He grew up at the family estate outside Casablanca where he lived for the first 13 years of his life. Growing up, he was consumed with soccer and rap, describing them as his two favorite childhood hobbies, before getting into basketball in his later teens. In 1996, at the age of 13, Kharbouch left Morocco with his parents and younger brother for New York City, where they settled in the South Bronx. Kharbouch spoke only his native languages of Moroccan Darija and French when he first arrived, and learned English in the streets and in the Bronx high schools of Lehman and Roosevelt. After struggling for two years, his father decided they would move back to Casablanca, but his mother opted to stay back with their children citing lack of opportunities back home. His mother was pregnant with his youngest brother at the time, who was born in the United States shortly after his father departed for Morocco. With three children, his mother was dependent on welfare for financial support. Kharbouch eventually found himself the primary breadwinner for the family. French Montana began his career as a battle rapper in his teens under the name Young French. In 2002, French and close friend Cams created a series of street DVDs called Cocaine City, drawing inspiration from the Smack DVD series popular at the time. The series featured interviews with major and upcoming rappers, personalities, and a focus on street music and hip hop beefs. Initially as Young French, he used the DVDs as a means of showcasing his talent as an underground artist, including in it his own original music, freestyles, and collaborations with other artists. The first volume in the series featured Pee Wee Kirkland and Remy Ma among others. What started out as a medium for developing an audience, quickly grew into one of the top-selling street DVDs. The series ran for eight years between 2002-2010, totaling 14 volumes, and multiple spinoff films. Based out of the Bronx, French ran the series with the help of childhood friends including Brock, Droop Pop and Cheeze, who went on to become the first rappers that formed the Coke Boys. In 2003, French suffered a gunshot to the head when he was confronted by two armed gunmen as he was leaving a recording studio in the Bronx. The incident resulted in one of the gunmen dead, in what is believed to be a case of \"friendly fire\" by one assailant against the other. French was then hospitalized for several weeks. Upon discharge, he discovered that he was set up by someone close to him and his circle. In 2007, French Montana released his debut mixtape French Revolution Vol. 1, which included collaborations with Uncle Murda, Jae Millz, Mazaradi Fox and Tony Yayo. The track \"Quarter to Eight\" was the first of many collaborations with Rick Ross. The J.Cardim-produced \"Straight Cash\" was French's first underground hit. In 2008, he released his second mixtape, Live From Africa.\n\nThis kind of power and influence often perpetuates these artists to be rewarded for bad behavior and established artists concerned with maintaining relevancy with younger fans often endorse this dynamic. This ultimately leads to an ethical tug-of-war. The murders of these types of young artists like Onfroy are preceded by legal and personal issues. For this young man it ranged from gun possession, domestic violence, to his own admission of beating up homosexual. Then toss in a list of enemies he perpetuated through his volatile behavior (which he often promoted via social media), a significant portion of the internet’s reaction was “good riddance” when news came of his death. What is haunting is the reality that Onfroy is not an outlier— 20-year old black male shot dead is a common headline and a Google search will show that. Youthism has created a self-destructive environment by giving too much tolerance to the youth and not doing our part as a society to hold them accountable for their actions. Older generations tend look at their own troubled pasts and perpetuate the belief that these artists will “grow out of their 20’s” when the right action should be to intervene, connect, and guide. Violence and drug abuse is problem that hip-hop should’ve grown out of long ago. The culture has risen to such a prominent status in society that having these vices still at the forefront of its image is a sign that something needs to be done and the responsibility falls on everyone. The older and younger generation. It’s one thing to be a keyboard activist and speak on the problem through the Twitter feeds and Instagram stories but it direct action to have a legitimate chance at making an impact. In the above video, French Montana demonstrates this by attempting to intervene on Mac Miller’s addiction to codeine. It’s an uncomfortable interaction to witness and that discomfort can be seen on Montana’s face but it shows promise that there’s some initiative by more established artists to speak up. Hip-hop has the resources to combat these serious issues and there’s a Forbes list to prove that but it comes down to the willingness to put egos aside and have a real discussion. Truth be told, it has nothing to do with the music anymore, it’s deeper than rap, and if the recent J. Cole and Lil Pump interview has shown us anything it’s that its possible to have these discussion no matter how big the generation gap. The other major hurdle to overcome is the hivemind and mob mentality that runs rampant on social media. It has stripped public thought of its beautiful ability to address social ills and deeply troubled individuals with a poignant and intelligent perspective. Society now only has two modes: ruthless crucifixion and unreasonable bias. No longer are we allowed to be flawed and terrifyingly complicated human beings — we’re either all good or all bad. Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy was the epitome of that — a young man who was justifiably despised by many but loved by countless. His music is filled with overwhelming depression, anger, regret, paranoia, un-repentance, and delusion. He wore his demons on his sleeve and his fans connected deeply with him because of it. The support for his career was deserved but it was the lack of accountability for his actions off the mic that led to his tragic end. Society will look at the face of XXXTENTACION plastered across media outlets and be blind to what they see. Society will think they see a 20-year old black male who got what he had coming to him and in a morbid way, they will be right. XXXTENTACION is a monster, a monster curated by a system filled with desensitized public personas represented by hashtags and memes. What they won’t see is Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, a 20-year old black man who died long before his fatal outcome. A young man who died when nobody answered his cries for help.\n\nFrench Montana's Excuse My French Is Finally Here, Though It Almost Didn't Happen\nCourtesy Bad Boy\/Interscope\nMoroccan-born, Bronx-raised rapper French Montana is at a photo shoot in Tompkins Square Park's basketball court. He's shooting the shit in fluent French with the photographer. A gaggle of scruffy teen skaters recognize him and look over as he saunters slowly—always slowly—about. \"Haaaannn,\" calls out one black teen. Montana reciprocates his calling card ad-lib that's also as much a trademark as the Serpico knit cap and the several chains he's wearing. His brother passes him some Ray-Ban Wayfarers for the shoot. \"Ayo, Frenchie. You skate?\" shouts another kid, this one a bit older. \"Nah,\" Montana says. \"I wish.\" The kid urges him to come over and learn. The two share a laugh. After the shoot it's back to Daddys House for press. The hallowed recording studio has been Montana HQ for the majority of the making of his debut, Excuse My French. It's been a long time in the making. \"While everyone was trying to get through the door, I got through the window,\" Montana says referring to his Cocaine City DVD series, the vehicle he bankrolled, which made him a hood household name and got him signed by P. Diddy to his Bad Boy label. Montana wasted no time producing huge records. \"Pop That\" topped Billboard charts, and \"Freak\" continues to climb. Excuse is the next rung on the ladder. \"There's a lot of excitement over this album,\" says Harve Pierre, Bad Boy president. \"It's going to be playing in every car passing; every barber shop will be playing it . . . like Ready to Die and Black Rob's first album.\" While growing up in the Bronx, Montana listened to those albums to learn the rap ropes. Acclimating to a brand-new culture is hard enough, and doubly so in a place like the South Bronx, traditionally one of New York's most impoverished and violent neighborhoods. \"I didn't get picked on because I always carried myself a certain way,\" Montana says. \"But it was hard at times because my English was poor and I really wanted to understand the culture.\" By the time he graduated from Columbus High School he was knee-deep in the drug game, taking what he calls \"calculated risks\" to get what and where he wanted. Getting caught would mean more than just time behind bars. \"I would get deported. There wasn't going to be a French Montana in Morocco.\" There almost wasn't going to be a French Montana, period. As calculating as he was, he wasn't able to avoid the treachery that comes with underworld dealings. In 2004, Montana was leaving a Bronx recording studio when two gunmen ran up on him. When the smoke cleared, Montana had been shot in the head, and one of his attackers lay dead. He awoke in Lincoln Hospital and left against doctor's orders, sure more gunmen would return to finish the job. Charges were dropped, and Montana never faced trial for the shooting. Oddly enough, it wasn't the bullet in his skull or the trial that left the biggest mark on Montana. He'd lost a sense of trust. \"The game is funny,\" he says. \"I got set up by someone who was like my family. That was what fucked with me the most. Because it taught me anyone can get touched if someone really wants to get you.\" Now at Daddys House, Montana talks to the studio's engineers, awaiting journalists and assorted record execs, demonstrating his serious work ethic. \"A lot of people see French's position in the game and don't recognize the hours and hours working and reworking songs like 'Shot Caller' until they felt right,\" says producer Harry Fraud, who helmed some of Montana's first breakthrough songs. As Montana preps for an interview he runs into another immigrant turned major player recording at Daddys House. Wyclef Jean is in the studio across the hall, and quickly talk turns to collaboration. \"But it's got to be Morocco meets Haiti, not Jersey meets the Bronx,\" says Jean. French laughs and agrees enthusiastically. To quote Jay-Z, \"Not bad, huh?\n\nEveryone I had worked with on my early projects is gone -- they’ve all been fired and there are new guys coming in that think they can teach old dogs new tricks. They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.\n\nSomething like \"Cruise\" really does show how similar music from different parts of the country really can be. I think the way that kids grow up now, that with social media they get it all at once. Like, the coolest table in the cafeteria is probably the most mixed table of all. It's got the coolest black kids, it's got the coolest white kids, it's got the coolest Asian kids, it's got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I'm saying? It's the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they're some pretty young guys they're like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They've been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they've been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it's a great saying, \"You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that.\" That's basically it. When you're talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It's a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you're listening to 'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that's so surprising to people. People don't understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, \"Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?\" Nah man, it's all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It's kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn't a Nelly fan. And it's a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn't have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I'm not anti-anything. It's just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That's why I say I'm not \"anti.\" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they're gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don't, you don't. It's getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn't have hip-hop. If they didn't like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I'm a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don't have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we're still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z's having a concert, I'm there. We're in a different era now. I'm not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing 'em. I don't care if I'm 80, I'mma put on some sneakers. And it's just one of those things that back in the day, it was a certain way you had to dress if you were older. \"Why do you have that baseball cap on? C'mon, you're a 50 year-old man. Why do you have on a ball cap and sneakers?\" Now, shit, it doesn't matter.\n\nBy Miranda Johnson with reporting by Rahman Dukes\nAlthough Lil Wayne was attacked after openly expressing his disdain for NYC, New York-bred rapper French Montana seems to be a little more understanding of the YMCMB MC’s feelings when it comes to traveling. “I mean if I was to go to New Orleans and catch a gun charge, I think there might be a point in time when I get sick and tired, and be like man I hate New Orleans,” explained French Montana. “It might not mean I hate the people, it’s that’s what I hate. Sometimes you might be like I hate Jamaican food, I’m not saying I hate Jamaicans. I think it go like that and I think that’s why nobody really got at him yet for saying that.”\nAfter catching a gun charge back in 2007 and dealing with the backlash from Nicki Minaj’s canceled Summer Jam performance, one could agree that Wayne and NYC have had a bit of a troubled past. Still, with all that’s happened with the YMCMB leader in the empire state, NY State Senator Malcolm Smith wasn’t so understanding. Holding a press conference immediately following Lil Wayne’s statement, Smith didn’t feel Weezy’s actions were the least bit justifiable. “New York City is the birthplace of the Hip Hop music movement,” Smith said in a statement issued from his office to MTV News this summer. “Millions of New Yorkers listen to his music every day. His comments outraged his local fans and residents. The group today will be demanding an apology of the hip hop star.

Send your questions for the artists @MTVRapFix!\n\nFrench Montana recently did an interview with Complex where he spoke about his new album, G.O.O.D. vs. YMCMB, and how 50 Cent could have been more successful. Fif apparently did not like what he had to say and took to Twitter to blast French. French on 50 from Complex interview:\nWhen we were doing your 10 Coke Boy Lessons, I thought it was interesting you said to avoid beef. Yeah. You can’t beef with people because it’ll scare money away. In the streets you can strong arm people and take money but you can’t do that in the industry. Right, because in the streets beef is way to expand your territory. Before, like with 50 Cent, beef used to be good for business. But now, beef is bad for business. That’s why I stay away from it. Is that why you avoid some of the situations? I look at someone like Pusha saying Lil Wayne’s Dedication 4 isn’t that good. Whereas you, you have Wayne on your songs but you rolled with Kanye before and then you also hang out with Rick Ross. It seems like avoiding beef has been a conscious decision. Yeah, you have to. I feel like you have to expand. But when you beef, you put negative energy out there and it brings negative energy back. When you put something positive out there, it brings positive energy back. I feel like if you want to beef go to the streets, beef with niggas that really wanna beef. If you have nothing to live for. Beef is not about money. [With rap] it’s like, you ain’t going to see them people you beefing with. You lying. You got security, you’re never at the same events. It’s like you beefing in a smart way if you’re trying to come up. Then it’s like a competition, you know like a battle rap. But if you want to battle rap you might as well call Fight Club, get to battle rapping. Don’t act like you want problems. You should avoid beef if you trying to make money. People get scared when you try to beef with people. In general, [even in street shit] nobody want to stand next to you if somebody about to shoot you, unless you have a a big lick [Ed. Note—A “lick” means a hustle.] They [used to] do that with 50 because 50 was the bank. They knew he was going to win. People ain’t doing that [anymore]. Full Complex interview by Insanul Ahmed HERE\nLead photo via BG\n\n“What we’re gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time.”\n— Troglodite, by the Jimmy Castor Bunch\nHip-Hop has always been hyper-conscious about its roots, maybe because it began with young people playing, and then rapping over, older music. Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http:\/\/rap.genius.com\/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow\nToday the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ\/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common\nIn this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nThe birth of hip-hop is said to have taken place at some point in the early ’70s, more specifically at a birthday party in the Bronx where a young Clive Campell (aka DJ Kool Herc) could be heard making magic happen on the 1s and 2s. Other pioneers of the movement include Afrika Bambaataa, The Sugarhill Gang, Run-D.M.C. and Kurtis Blow, but no one embraced this new style of music quite like Joseph Sadler, also known as Grandmaster Flash. In a recent interview with The New York Times, he says, “The Bronx created it. We all played a part. Herc was first, the founder. Then Bam had the most selections. And I just came up with a way to deliver the music, technically speaking.” Coming from a background filled with ideas of math and science, Flash was able to look at the inner workings of hip-hop with a more critical eye, developing and\/or perfecting three techniques that are, by many DJs, still considered relevant today: the backspin technique, punch phrasing and scratching. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were the first hip-hop act to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, cementing the genre’s rightful place in music history. These days, so-called fans can be heard complaining that “hip-hop is dead,” but that is not the case. Maybe rap songs that can currently be heard on the radio aren’t what old school heads are interested in hearing these days, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t artists\/DJs working to carry on the legacy, such as A-F-R-O and the nine-year old female phenomenon out of DC, DJ Kool Flash (whose name was inspired by the man himself). And this past Friday night, hip-hop sounded alive and well when Grandmaster Flash dropped some current tracks inside his set at House of Yes in Brooklyn, along with classic hits like Michael Jackson’s “Blame It On The Boogie” and Earth, Wind & Fire’s “September.” Brooklyn Radio’s Lara Gamble was able to speak with the legend just before he took the stage about his role in the pages of hip-hop history and how he’s hoping “The Get Down” will enlighten future fans. My earliest memory is perhaps being an architect and not realizing I was being an architect. I think – how do I say this? This lovely culture we call hip-hop has come a long, long, long, long way. And, as far as technology is concerned, you know, hindsight, what we did, we did with absolutely nothing: no computers, no studio, no equipment, no samplers, no nothing. So, pretty much, my first memory is being a scientist probably because that’s when it was more…being one of the architects of this culture, I did it with math and science. So, that’s probably my biggest memory of it. How did growing up in the Bronx influence your decision to pursue DJing full-time? I don’t know if it influenced me, it’s just that what I was seeing in my landscape, as far as DJing was concerned, I was very unhappy with what I was seeing. And I noticed that with each particular composition, the most exciting part of the song was when the least band members was playing. So, when it was just the drummer, but unjustifiably, that particular part of the song was always too short. So, in my anger and in my frustration as a kid, is when I said to myself, “I’m going to come up with a system that’s going to allow that particular section, which is ten seconds, and make it seamlessly ten minutes.” Today they would call it “turntablism” or the beginnings of what we call “rap” by extending the bed. So, that’s pretty much it. Do you recall the first record you ever purchased? I think the majority of the records that were in my early collection…I used to go to people’s houses. Back then, hip-hop was more like a village. Everybody knew everybody. So, I became very popular with their parents. When I would go for dinner or whatever, hanging out, I would say, “Oh, by the way, Mrs. Williams” you know, their moms or whatever, “would you happen to have any records that you want to throw away?”\nAnd that’s when my collection really started because I was too poor to buy records.\n\nQuestion:What did French Montana say about the evolution of hip-hop and its different generations?",

            "passage": "North Carolinian hip-hop icon J. Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.”\nThe “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.”\nAs aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist. He’ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper’s new attempt at Cole’s attention in the video below.

            "passage": "|Born||November 9, 1984|\n|Origin||South Bronx, New York, U.S.|\nKarim Kharbouch (born November 9, 1984), better known by his stage name French Montana, is a Moroccan-American rapper, singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Morocco, he immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 13. He is the founder of Coke Boys Records, and its predecessor Cocaine City Records. In 2012, he signed a joint-venture recording deal with Bad Boy Records and Maybach Music Group. Kharbouch made his mixtape debut in 2007. In 2010, he had his breakthrough with \"Choppa Choppa Down\". He released his debut studio album Excuse My French on May 21, 2013. In July 2017, Montana released his second studio album, Jungle Rules, which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. The album was supported by the single \"Unforgettable\", featuring Swae Lee, which became Montana's first song as lead artist to reach the top 10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. He has also collaborated with a multitude of artists, such as Drake, Lil Wayne, The Weeknd, Young Thug, T.I., Chris Brown, among others. Karim Kharbouch (Arabic: ? Kar?m Kharb [kæ?i:m bu:?]) was born on November 9, 1984, in Casablanca, Morocco. He grew up at the family estate outside Casablanca where he lived for the first 13 years of his life. Growing up, he was consumed with soccer and rap, describing them as his two favorite childhood hobbies, before getting into basketball in his later teens. In 1996, at the age of 13, Kharbouch left Morocco with his parents and younger brother for New York City, where they settled in the South Bronx. Kharbouch spoke only his native languages of Moroccan Darija and French when he first arrived, and learned English in the streets and in the Bronx high schools of Lehman and Roosevelt. After struggling for two years, his father decided they would move back to Casablanca, but his mother opted to stay back with their children citing lack of opportunities back home. His mother was pregnant with his youngest brother at the time, who was born in the United States shortly after his father departed for Morocco. With three children, his mother was dependent on welfare for financial support. Kharbouch eventually found himself the primary breadwinner for the family. French Montana began his career as a battle rapper in his teens under the name Young French. In 2002, French and close friend Cams created a series of street DVDs called Cocaine City, drawing inspiration from the Smack DVD series popular at the time. The series featured interviews with major and upcoming rappers, personalities, and a focus on street music and hip hop beefs. Initially as Young French, he used the DVDs as a means of showcasing his talent as an underground artist, including in it his own original music, freestyles, and collaborations with other artists. The first volume in the series featured Pee Wee Kirkland and Remy Ma among others. What started out as a medium for developing an audience, quickly grew into one of the top-selling street DVDs. The series ran for eight years between 2002-2010, totaling 14 volumes, and multiple spinoff films. Based out of the Bronx, French ran the series with the help of childhood friends including Brock, Droop Pop and Cheeze, who went on to become the first rappers that formed the Coke Boys. In 2003, French suffered a gunshot to the head when he was confronted by two armed gunmen as he was leaving a recording studio in the Bronx. The incident resulted in one of the gunmen dead, in what is believed to be a case of \"friendly fire\" by one assailant against the other. French was then hospitalized for several weeks. Upon discharge, he discovered that he was set up by someone close to him and his circle. In 2007, French Montana released his debut mixtape French Revolution Vol. 1, which included collaborations with Uncle Murda, Jae Millz, Mazaradi Fox and Tony Yayo. The track \"Quarter to Eight\" was the first of many collaborations with Rick Ross. The J.Cardim-produced \"Straight Cash\" was French's first underground hit. In 2008, he released his second mixtape, Live From Africa.",

            "passage": "This kind of power and influence often perpetuates these artists to be rewarded for bad behavior and established artists concerned with maintaining relevancy with younger fans often endorse this dynamic. This ultimately leads to an ethical tug-of-war. The murders of these types of young artists like Onfroy are preceded by legal and personal issues. For this young man it ranged from gun possession, domestic violence, to his own admission of beating up homosexual. Then toss in a list of enemies he perpetuated through his volatile behavior (which he often promoted via social media), a significant portion of the internet’s reaction was “good riddance” when news came of his death. What is haunting is the reality that Onfroy is not an outlier— 20-year old black male shot dead is a common headline and a Google search will show that. Youthism has created a self-destructive environment by giving too much tolerance to the youth and not doing our part as a society to hold them accountable for their actions. Older generations tend look at their own troubled pasts and perpetuate the belief that these artists will “grow out of their 20’s” when the right action should be to intervene, connect, and guide. Violence and drug abuse is problem that hip-hop should’ve grown out of long ago. The culture has risen to such a prominent status in society that having these vices still at the forefront of its image is a sign that something needs to be done and the responsibility falls on everyone. The older and younger generation. It’s one thing to be a keyboard activist and speak on the problem through the Twitter feeds and Instagram stories but it direct action to have a legitimate chance at making an impact. In the above video, French Montana demonstrates this by attempting to intervene on Mac Miller’s addiction to codeine. It’s an uncomfortable interaction to witness and that discomfort can be seen on Montana’s face but it shows promise that there’s some initiative by more established artists to speak up. Hip-hop has the resources to combat these serious issues and there’s a Forbes list to prove that but it comes down to the willingness to put egos aside and have a real discussion. Truth be told, it has nothing to do with the music anymore, it’s deeper than rap, and if the recent J. Cole and Lil Pump interview has shown us anything it’s that its possible to have these discussion no matter how big the generation gap. The other major hurdle to overcome is the hivemind and mob mentality that runs rampant on social media. It has stripped public thought of its beautiful ability to address social ills and deeply troubled individuals with a poignant and intelligent perspective. Society now only has two modes: ruthless crucifixion and unreasonable bias. No longer are we allowed to be flawed and terrifyingly complicated human beings — we’re either all good or all bad. Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy was the epitome of that — a young man who was justifiably despised by many but loved by countless. His music is filled with overwhelming depression, anger, regret, paranoia, un-repentance, and delusion. He wore his demons on his sleeve and his fans connected deeply with him because of it. The support for his career was deserved but it was the lack of accountability for his actions off the mic that led to his tragic end. Society will look at the face of XXXTENTACION plastered across media outlets and be blind to what they see. Society will think they see a 20-year old black male who got what he had coming to him and in a morbid way, they will be right. XXXTENTACION is a monster, a monster curated by a system filled with desensitized public personas represented by hashtags and memes. What they won’t see is Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, a 20-year old black man who died long before his fatal outcome. A young man who died when nobody answered his cries for help.",

            "passage": "French Montana's Excuse My French Is Finally Here, Though It Almost Didn't Happen\nCourtesy Bad Boy\/Interscope\nMoroccan-born, Bronx-raised rapper French Montana is at a photo shoot in Tompkins Square Park's basketball court. He's shooting the shit in fluent French with the photographer. A gaggle of scruffy teen skaters recognize him and look over as he saunters slowly—always slowly—about. \"Haaaannn,\" calls out one black teen. Montana reciprocates his calling card ad-lib that's also as much a trademark as the Serpico knit cap and the several chains he's wearing. His brother passes him some Ray-Ban Wayfarers for the shoot. \"Ayo, Frenchie. You skate?\" shouts another kid, this one a bit older. \"Nah,\" Montana says. \"I wish.\" The kid urges him to come over and learn. The two share a laugh. After the shoot it's back to Daddys House for press. The hallowed recording studio has been Montana HQ for the majority of the making of his debut, Excuse My French. It's been a long time in the making. \"While everyone was trying to get through the door, I got through the window,\" Montana says referring to his Cocaine City DVD series, the vehicle he bankrolled, which made him a hood household name and got him signed by P. Diddy to his Bad Boy label. Montana wasted no time producing huge records. \"Pop That\" topped Billboard charts, and \"Freak\" continues to climb. Excuse is the next rung on the ladder. \"There's a lot of excitement over this album,\" says Harve Pierre, Bad Boy president. \"It's going to be playing in every car passing; every barber shop will be playing it . . . like Ready to Die and Black Rob's first album.\" While growing up in the Bronx, Montana listened to those albums to learn the rap ropes. Acclimating to a brand-new culture is hard enough, and doubly so in a place like the South Bronx, traditionally one of New York's most impoverished and violent neighborhoods. \"I didn't get picked on because I always carried myself a certain way,\" Montana says. \"But it was hard at times because my English was poor and I really wanted to understand the culture.\" By the time he graduated from Columbus High School he was knee-deep in the drug game, taking what he calls \"calculated risks\" to get what and where he wanted. Getting caught would mean more than just time behind bars. \"I would get deported. There wasn't going to be a French Montana in Morocco.\" There almost wasn't going to be a French Montana, period. As calculating as he was, he wasn't able to avoid the treachery that comes with underworld dealings. In 2004, Montana was leaving a Bronx recording studio when two gunmen ran up on him. When the smoke cleared, Montana had been shot in the head, and one of his attackers lay dead. He awoke in Lincoln Hospital and left against doctor's orders, sure more gunmen would return to finish the job. Charges were dropped, and Montana never faced trial for the shooting. Oddly enough, it wasn't the bullet in his skull or the trial that left the biggest mark on Montana. He'd lost a sense of trust. \"The game is funny,\" he says. \"I got set up by someone who was like my family. That was what fucked with me the most. Because it taught me anyone can get touched if someone really wants to get you.\" Now at Daddys House, Montana talks to the studio's engineers, awaiting journalists and assorted record execs, demonstrating his serious work ethic. \"A lot of people see French's position in the game and don't recognize the hours and hours working and reworking songs like 'Shot Caller' until they felt right,\" says producer Harry Fraud, who helmed some of Montana's first breakthrough songs. As Montana preps for an interview he runs into another immigrant turned major player recording at Daddys House. Wyclef Jean is in the studio across the hall, and quickly talk turns to collaboration. \"But it's got to be Morocco meets Haiti, not Jersey meets the Bronx,\" says Jean. French laughs and agrees enthusiastically. To quote Jay-Z, \"Not bad, huh?",

They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.",

            "passage": "Something like \"Cruise\" really does show how similar music from different parts of the country really can be. I think the way that kids grow up now, that with social media they get it all at once. Like, the coolest table in the cafeteria is probably the most mixed table of all. It's got the coolest black kids, it's got the coolest white kids, it's got the coolest Asian kids, it's got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I'm saying? It's the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they're some pretty young guys they're like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They've been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they've been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it's a great saying, \"You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that.\" That's basically it. When you're talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It's a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you're listening to 'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that's so surprising to people. People don't understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, \"Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?\" Nah man, it's all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It's kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn't a Nelly fan. And it's a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn't have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I'm not anti-anything. It's just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That's why I say I'm not \"anti.\" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they're gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don't, you don't. It's getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn't have hip-hop. If they didn't like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I'm a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don't have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we're still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z's having a concert, I'm there. We're in a different era now. I'm not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing 'em. I don't care if I'm 80, I'mma put on some sneakers. And it's just one of those things that back in the day, it was a certain way you had to dress if you were older. \"Why do you have that baseball cap on? C'mon, you're a 50 year-old man. Why do you have on a ball cap and sneakers?\" Now, shit, it doesn't matter.",

            "passage": "By Miranda Johnson with reporting by Rahman Dukes\nAlthough Lil Wayne was attacked after openly expressing his disdain for NYC, New York-bred rapper French Montana seems to be a little more understanding of the YMCMB MC’s feelings when it comes to traveling. “I mean if I was to go to New Orleans and catch a gun charge, I think there might be a point in time when I get sick and tired, and be like man I hate New Orleans,” explained French Montana. “It might not mean I hate the people, it’s that’s what I hate. Sometimes you might be like I hate Jamaican food, I’m not saying I hate Jamaicans. I think it go like that and I think that’s why nobody really got at him yet for saying that.”\nAfter catching a gun charge back in 2007 and dealing with the backlash from Nicki Minaj’s canceled Summer Jam performance, one could agree that Wayne and NYC have had a bit of a troubled past. Still, with all that’s happened with the YMCMB leader in the empire state, NY State Senator Malcolm Smith wasn’t so understanding. Holding a press conference immediately following Lil Wayne’s statement, Smith didn’t feel Weezy’s actions were the least bit justifiable. “New York City is the birthplace of the Hip Hop music movement,” Smith said in a statement issued from his office to MTV News this summer. “Millions of New Yorkers listen to his music every day. His comments outraged his local fans and residents. The group today will be demanding an apology of the hip hop star.

Fif apparently did not like what he had to say and took to Twitter to blast French. French on 50 from Complex interview:\nWhen we were doing your 10 Coke Boy Lessons, I thought it was interesting you said to avoid beef. Yeah. You can’t beef with people because it’ll scare money away. In the streets you can strong arm people and take money but you can’t do that in the industry. Right, because in the streets beef is way to expand your territory. Before, like with 50 Cent, beef used to be good for business. But now, beef is bad for business. That’s why I stay away from it. Is that why you avoid some of the situations? I look at someone like Pusha saying Lil Wayne’s Dedication 4 isn’t that good. Whereas you, you have Wayne on your songs but you rolled with Kanye before and then you also hang out with Rick Ross. It seems like avoiding beef has been a conscious decision. Yeah, you have to. I feel like you have to expand. But when you beef, you put negative energy out there and it brings negative energy back. When you put something positive out there, it brings positive energy back. I feel like if you want to beef go to the streets, beef with niggas that really wanna beef. If you have nothing to live for. Beef is not about money. [With rap] it’s like, you ain’t going to see them people you beefing with. You lying. You got security, you’re never at the same events. It’s like you beefing in a smart way if you’re trying to come up. Then it’s like a competition, you know like a battle rap. But if you want to battle rap you might as well call Fight Club, get to battle rapping. Don’t act like you want problems. You should avoid beef if you trying to make money. People get scared when you try to beef with people. In general, [even in street shit] nobody want to stand next to you if somebody about to shoot you, unless you have a a big lick [Ed. Note—A “lick” means a hustle.] They [used to] do that with 50 because 50 was the bank. They knew he was going to win. People ain’t doing that [anymore].

            "passage": "“What we’re gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time.”\n— Troglodite, by the Jimmy Castor Bunch\nHip-Hop has always been hyper-conscious about its roots, maybe because it began with young people playing, and then rapping over, older music. Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http:\/\/rap.genius.com\/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow\nToday the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ\/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common\nIn this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.",

            "passage": "The birth of hip-hop is said to have taken place at some point in the early ’70s, more specifically at a birthday party in the Bronx where a young Clive Campell (aka DJ Kool Herc) could be heard making magic happen on the 1s and 2s. Other pioneers of the movement include Afrika Bambaataa, The Sugarhill Gang, Run-D.M.C. and Kurtis Blow, but no one embraced this new style of music quite like Joseph Sadler, also known as Grandmaster Flash. In a recent interview with The New York Times, he says, “The Bronx created it. We all played a part. Herc was first, the founder. Then Bam had the most selections. And I just came up with a way to deliver the music, technically speaking.” Coming from a background filled with ideas of math and science, Flash was able to look at the inner workings of hip-hop with a more critical eye, developing and\/or perfecting three techniques that are, by many DJs, still considered relevant today: the backspin technique, punch phrasing and scratching. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were the first hip-hop act to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, cementing the genre’s rightful place in music history. These days, so-called fans can be heard complaining that “hip-hop is dead,” but that is not the case. Maybe rap songs that can currently be heard on the radio aren’t what old school heads are interested in hearing these days, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t artists\/DJs working to carry on the legacy, such as A-F-R-O and the nine-year old female phenomenon out of DC, DJ Kool Flash (whose name was inspired by the man himself). And this past Friday night, hip-hop sounded alive and well when Grandmaster Flash dropped some current tracks inside his set at House of Yes in Brooklyn, along with classic hits like Michael Jackson’s “Blame It On The Boogie” and Earth, Wind & Fire’s “September.” Brooklyn Radio’s Lara Gamble was able to speak with the legend just before he took the stage about his role in the pages of hip-hop history and how he’s hoping “The Get Down” will enlighten future fans. My earliest memory is perhaps being an architect and not realizing I was being an architect. I think – how do I say this? This lovely culture we call hip-hop has come a long, long, long, long way. And, as far as technology is concerned, you know, hindsight, what we did, we did with absolutely nothing: no computers, no studio, no equipment, no samplers, no nothing. So, pretty much, my first memory is being a scientist probably because that’s when it was more…being one of the architects of this culture, I did it with math and science. So, that’s probably my biggest memory of it. How did growing up in the Bronx influence your decision to pursue DJing full-time? I don’t know if it influenced me, it’s just that what I was seeing in my landscape, as far as DJing was concerned, I was very unhappy with what I was seeing. And I noticed that with each particular composition, the most exciting part of the song was when the least band members was playing. So, when it was just the drummer, but unjustifiably, that particular part of the song was always too short. So, in my anger and in my frustration as a kid, is when I said to myself, “I’m going to come up with a system that’s going to allow that particular section, which is ten seconds, and make it seamlessly ten minutes.” Today they would call it “turntablism” or the beginnings of what we call “rap” by extending the bed. So, that’s pretty much it. Do you recall the first record you ever purchased? I think the majority of the records that were in my early collection…I used to go to people’s houses. Back then, hip-hop was more like a village. Everybody knew everybody. So, I became very popular with their parents. When I would go for dinner or whatever, hanging out, I would say, “Oh, by the way, Mrs. Williams” you know, their moms or whatever, “would you happen to have any records that you want to throw away?”\nAnd that’s when my collection really started because I was too poor to buy records.",

After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born.

            "passage": "What is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery.

    "text": "Summary: The Gospel of Christ will prepare and enable us to take spiritual ground and build healthier relationships. (Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.",

    "question": "What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?",
    "gold": "The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars. They prevented slipping on difficult terrain and enabled soldiers to both hold their ground and advance effectively, as a retreating army rarely wins wars, while an army that can advance and take ground is more likely to be victorious.",
    "answer": "The concept of \"spiked soles\" in Roman military footwear, often referred to as caligae, was more about traction and durability rather than as a direct weapon. The caligae, or military boots, were designed to provide Roman soldiers with stability on various terrains, especially in wet or muddy conditions. The hobnailed soles gave soldiers better grip and traction, allowing them to move quickly and maintain their balance during maneuvers or battles.\n\nThe spikes also helped to protect the feet from sharp objects in the ground and could be used as a defensive measure to deter enemies from getting too close. However, they were not specifically designed as offensive weapons. The primary purpose of Roman military footwear was to ensure the comfort, mobility, and protection of the soldier, which in turn contributed to the overall effectiveness of the Roman military.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: gymnasiums, and many taverns, baths and brothels. Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word \"palace\" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves. Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant, in spite of tirades against the \"softening\" effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style. Social history and structure\nMany aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic's primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved. Clothing and dining\nMen typically wore a toga, and women a stola. The woman's stola looked different than a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis, (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals. Romans had simple food habits.\n\nIn a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism. This article is part of the series on:\nMilitary of ancient Rome (portal)\n753 BC – AD 476\nStructural history Roman army (unit types and ranks, legions, auxiliaries, generals) Roman navy (fleets, admirals) Campaign history Lists of wars and battles Decorations and punishments Technological history Military engineering (castra, siege engines, arches, roads) Political history Strategy and tactics Infantry tactics Frontiers and fortifications (limes, Hadrian's Wall)\nThe structural history of the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.\n\ndragoon, hobilar): A solider who moved about on horseback or other means other than his own feet, but fought on foot as infantryman rather than mounted as a cavalryman. musician: Military musicians conveyed signals or made field calls, such as a signal to attack or retreat. In armies where soldiers were trained to march, musicians used percussion instruments to beat a cadence by which a pace was set. oarsman: Rowers aboard oar-driven ships were most common in the Mediterranean Sea during the classical age of Greece and the dominion f Rome. Contrary to common belief, oarsmen were more often freemen than slaves and received decent pay for their services. Outside of the Mediterranean, oarsmen were usually also warriors, for example, the Viking raiders of the ninth century onward. orbis: A ring-shaped tactical formation used by Roman troops, especially during an emergency, such as surprise attack by a numerically superior foe. peltast: In ancient Greece, a light infantryman, named for his light-weight shield, or pelte, and armed with javelins. petardier: A soldier who hurled pots of pitch or other combustibles onto the enemy from the walls of a castle. During the English Civil War, such troops were referred to as grenadiers. Eventually, this latter term took on a different meaning for an elite sort of soldier. phalanx: Classic ancient Greek and Macedonian formation in which highly trained heavy pikemen, formed in blocks of eight- to sixteen-men deep, locked their shields into a wall and pointed their pikes straight forward. The first four or five pikes extended beyond the front of the formation, presenting a steel hedgehog to an enemy. When phalangist charged, the phalanx hit an enemy formation like a freight train. The phalanx could be deployed in a variety of shapes, including a straight line, diagonal line, square, crescent or wedge. Disadvantages were that it could only move in a forward direction, could not be used on the same breadth of rough terrain as other infantry formations and was especially vulnerable on its flanks and rear. More fluid Roman formations were used to overcome and defeat the formidable phalanx. priest: Holy men have fought alongside their flocks throughout the world. Mesoamerican priests served as elite troops or commanders; Hindu brahmins who were unable to find posts as priests took up arms as mercenary soldiers; and Buddhist warrior monks fought alongside the samurai of Japan. Priests also fought with other soldiers during the Middle Ages. For example, during the A.D. 1066 Norman Conquest of England, a warrior bishop accompanied the invasion force, wearing a chain mail hauberk and armed with a heavy spiked club. Christian holy men were forbidden by their religion to shed blood, so the club and mace were popular weapons with them. principe: The soldiers in the middle rank of a Roman three-line military formation. rank and file: Companies of soldiers parade, or maneuver, in ranks and files. Ranks go from left to right, and files go from front to rear. In European armies, junior soldiers were called rankers as opposed to their officers, who took up their posts outside of the mass of soldiers lined up in ranks and files. razor women: An elite force of female soldiers employed by the king of Dahomey, Africa, most notably in the nineteenth century. At times this force may have been utilized as a special bodyguard, but at one point it was 2,400 strong and apparently battle-ready. Their main weapons were long, two-handed razors, called nyek-ple-nen-toh, which could fold into their hafts like giant straight razors. See blunderbuss woman. regiment: A grouping of several companies under a staff of additional officers (typically a major, lieutenant colonel and colonel). In the sixteenth century when companies or band of soldiers were so grouped and placed under a staff, they were said to be regimented. scout: Soldiers deployed ahead of or to the sides of an army to detect the presence of the enemy.\n\nThe Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 1st century AD – 2nd century AD –\nBy 6 AD, the initial length of service for a Roman soldier (legionary) was increased to 20 years from 16 years, and it was complemented by the praemia militare (or discharge bonus), a lump sum that was increased to 12,000 sesterces (or 3,000 denarii). And by the middle of 1st century AD, the service was further extended to 25 years. Now beyond official service lengths, the protocols were rarely followed in times marked by wars. This resulted in retaining of the legionaries well beyond their service periods, with some men fighting under their legions for over three to four decades. Suffice it to say, such chaotic measures frequently resulted in mutinies. Many potential recruits were still drawn to the prospect of joining a legion because of the ‘booty factor’. In essence, many charismatic commanders touted the apparent prevalence of loot (and its ‘fair’ distribution), especially when conducting wars against the richer and powerful neighbors. According to Cicero, this might have been the prime factor that motivated the disparate troops under Marc Antony. The popular practice also alludes to the penchant for plundering – with the soldiers tending to strip the dead as the very first act after achieving victory over their foes. However, the life of a legionary was not all about triumphs, mutinies, and plundering. There were definitely some progressive measures put forth by the Romans when it came to bravery. For example, if the soldier was severely injured and couldn’t continue further with his military tenure, he was given a missio causaria or medical discharge that was equivalent to honorable discharge or honesta missio. This in turn equated to a societal status that was higher than ordinary civilians, which made the discharged legionary exempt from taxes and other civic duties. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 3rd century AD –\nWhile Roman legions fighting with their full capacity was a regular occurrence during early 2nd century AD, by the middle of the 3rd century the conflicts faced by the Roman Empire (and the changing emperors) were volatile from both the geographical and logistical scope. And so it was uncommon and rather impractical for the entire legion to leave its provincial base to fight a ‘distant’ war on the shifting frontiers of 3rd century AD. As a solution, the Roman military commanders sanctioned the use of vexillationes – detachments from individual legions that could be easily transferred without compromising the core strength of a legion (which was needed for fortifying and policing its ‘native’ province). These mobile combat ‘divisions’, comprising one or two cohorts, were usually tasked with handling the smaller enemy forces while being also used for garrisoning duties along strategic points like roads, bridges, and forts. And on rare occasions when the Romans were faced by a large number of opposing troops, many of these different vexillationes were combined to form a bigger field army. Moreover, the importance of detachments was not only limited to the combat-duty bound vexillationes. Emperor Gallienus (who ruled alone from 260 to 268 AD) created his own mobile field army consisting of special detachments from the praetorians, legio II Parthica, and other guard units. Hailed as the comitatus (retinue), this central reserve force functioned under the emperor’s direct command, thus hinting at the ambit of insecurities faced by the Roman rulers and elites during the ‘Crisis of the Third Century’. Interestingly enough, many of ‘extra’ equites (cavalry) that were assigned to each conventional legion, were also inducted as the elite promoti cavalry in the already opulent (and the militarily capable) scope of the comitatus.\n\nIn fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).\n\nLe Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.\n\nFor a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum’s “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” exhibition explores the origins of high heels worn by women and men across the world since ancient times. Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.\n\nThey were complemented by the equites (cavalrymen who belonged to the richest sections of the Roman society) and the contrasting velites (the lightly armed skirmishers who were the poorest). The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 3rd century BC – late 2nd century BC –\nThe military overhaul, indicating the transition from phalanx formations to manipular ones, is sometimes referred to as the Polybian reform (especially in the post 290 BC period). By this time, the citizen militia (or soldiers) of Republican Rome were levied and then assembled in the Capitol on the day that was proclaimed by the Consuls in their edictum. This process was known as dilectus, and interestingly the men volunteers were arranged in terms of their similar heights and age. This brought orderliness in terms of physical appearance, while similar equipment (if not uniform) made the organized soldiers look even more ‘homogeneous’. The Roman army recruits also had to swear an oath of obedience, which was known as sacramentum dicere. This symbolically bound them with the Roman state, their commander, and more importantly to their fellow comrades-in-arms. In terms of historical tradition, this oath was only formalized before the commencement of the Battle of Cannae, to uphold the faltering morale of the Hannibal-afflicted Roman army. According to Livy, the oath went somewhat like this – “Never to leave the ranks because of fear or to run away, but only to retrieve or grab a weapon, to kill an enemy or to rescue a comrade.”\nHowever in spite of oaths and morale-drumming exercises, the bloody day of the Battle of Cannae accounted for over 40,000 Roman deaths (the figure is put at 55,000 by Livy, and 70,000 by Polybius), which equated to over 80 percent of the Roman army fielded in the battle. Now, according to modern estimation, the male population of Rome circa 216 BC was around 400,000. So, considering the number of casualties at the Battle of Cannae, the baleful figures pertained to 5 to 10 percent of the total number of Roman males in the Republic (considering there were also Italic allies present in the battle) – with all the casualties occurring in a single day! The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 1st century BC –\nThe last phase of the Roman Republic was marked by yet another military overhaul, better known as the Marian reforms (circa 107 BC). Alluding to a far more influential course of action than the previous centuries of military reorganizations, these reforms resulted in the military inclusion of the capite censi, the landless Romans who were now assessed in the census and counted as potential recruits that could bolster the army. Consequently, the state was responsible for providing the arms and equipment to these previously disfranchised masses, thus allowing many of the poorer men to be employed as professional soldiers of the burgeoning Roman realm. The reforms also focused on the formation of a standing army, as opposed to conscripted militias who were available seasonally within the timeframe of a year. Furthermore, the amends also touched upon the provision of retirement pensions and land grants to military men who had completed their terms of service. Suffice it to say, the series of reforms credibly improved the prowess of the Roman military machine, especially with the adoption of standardized equipment and training of most ranks of soldiers. Simply put, by the end of this epoch, the Roman legions were far more uniform in their appearance, while adopting systematic policies, orderly discipline, and reliable battlefield tactics. On the flip side, the Marian reforms indirectly paved the way for the fall of the Roman Republic. The legions, by virtue of their intrinsic organization and habitual fraternity, were more loyal to their ambitious generals than the state and Senate. In essence, this was the very same epoch that was witness to the ‘alarming’ triumphs of the soldiers of Julius Caesar, Pompey and Marc Antony (as opposed to the ‘collective’ armies of Rome).\n\nWhat you may find surprising is that Egyptian women were using intra-uterine devices (IUDs) made from small copper plates at least one thousand years before Rome even existed - and this technology almost certainly remained in use during the Roman-era. The same technique was even used for animal husbandry for female pack animals. So once again, don't underestimate the Roman woman's desire to live life with the same certainties as anyone in the 21st-century.

Julius Caesar took his last breath on the Senate steps and the Roman world - not to mention ours - was changed forever. There's only one problem. When Julius Caesar was assassinated in March 15th, 44 BC, the Senate House no longer existed. The old timber senate building had been burnt to the ground in early 52 BC when angry supporters of Clodius made the building his funeral pyre. So - the long and short of it - Julius Caesar did not die on the steps of a building that did not exist. So where did the end of Caesar come? For several years the Senate had been meeting in Pompey's theatre, several blocks away. It had a prominent entry, but like most theatres it had a back door leading out to a lane-way. And guess who got knifed coming through the back door? Julius Caesar more or less died in an alleyway. Not quite what you see in most documentaries or movies. Et tu, Brute!

When Hannibal's Punic forces were overwhelmed in October 202 BC, Rome imposed a war reparations tax on Carthage of 800,000lbs of silver spread over fifty years...gold was excluded from the deal. It was all about currency...that silver was worth the equivalent of $5.6-trillion to the Roman treasury while gold would not be used for Roman coinage for another century. For more on Roman History, check out 'Vagabond' - live on Amazon now and on YouTube\nTuesday, 12 March 2013\nIt might be surprising to hear but silver was far more important to Rome than gold...although, as today, its value was far lower. Silver set the standard for the finance trade and was pressed into the Denarius (the Roman equivalent of the $100 note in the late Republic) for several centuries. Because of its importance to the value of the Roman currency, silver - and the lead it was mined with - were state controlled by the 1st-century AD; over-production would have decreased the value of the denarius while under-production would have driven inflation...concepts the Roman Treasury was just as aware of as today's modern treasury officials. So the mining of silver - and finding new mines - was particularly important to the Roman Empire. Much of this mining was focused in Spain where some shafts produced over 300lb (around $2.1-million worth) of silver per day...however as the Empire expanded, a considerable percentage of production was shifted to Britain. It is quite possible the underlying reason Claudius committed to the invasion of Britain was to keep the Roman currency stable. Trajan's invasion of Dacia was also driven by mining...and the fact the Roman Empire went into a long inflation-driven decline in the years after expansionism ended suggests the economy was unable to produce enough silver to sustain the currency's value. Goes to show nothing much changes...even if bankers have got more creative.

This is Pliny's explanation for the production of pure gold - \"Gold is first heated with twice its weight of salt, three times its weight of copper pyrites, and then heated again with two parts salt and one of alum (most likely iron sulphate rather than potassium aluminium sulphate in this case). This process removes the impurities when the other substances have been burnt away in an earthenware crucible.\"\n\nQuestion:What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?",

Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word \"palace\" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves. Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant, in spite of tirades against the \"softening\" effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style. Social history and structure\nMany aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic's primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved. Clothing and dining\nMen typically wore a toga, and women a stola. The woman's stola looked different than a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis, (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals. Romans had simple food habits.",

Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.

The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.",

            "passage": "dragoon, hobilar): A solider who moved about on horseback or other means other than his own feet, but fought on foot as infantryman rather than mounted as a cavalryman. musician: Military musicians conveyed signals or made field calls, such as a signal to attack or retreat. In armies where soldiers were trained to march, musicians used percussion instruments to beat a cadence by which a pace was set. oarsman: Rowers aboard oar-driven ships were most common in the Mediterranean Sea during the classical age of Greece and the dominion f Rome. Contrary to common belief, oarsmen were more often freemen than slaves and received decent pay for their services. Outside of the Mediterranean, oarsmen were usually also warriors, for example, the Viking raiders of the ninth century onward. orbis: A ring-shaped tactical formation used by Roman troops, especially during an emergency, such as surprise attack by a numerically superior foe. peltast: In ancient Greece, a light infantryman, named for his light-weight shield, or pelte, and armed with javelins. petardier: A soldier who hurled pots of pitch or other combustibles onto the enemy from the walls of a castle. During the English Civil War, such troops were referred to as grenadiers. Eventually, this latter term took on a different meaning for an elite sort of soldier. phalanx: Classic ancient Greek and Macedonian formation in which highly trained heavy pikemen, formed in blocks of eight- to sixteen-men deep, locked their shields into a wall and pointed their pikes straight forward. The first four or five pikes extended beyond the front of the formation, presenting a steel hedgehog to an enemy. When phalangist charged, the phalanx hit an enemy formation like a freight train. The phalanx could be deployed in a variety of shapes, including a straight line, diagonal line, square, crescent or wedge. Disadvantages were that it could only move in a forward direction, could not be used on the same breadth of rough terrain as other infantry formations and was especially vulnerable on its flanks and rear. More fluid Roman formations were used to overcome and defeat the formidable phalanx. priest: Holy men have fought alongside their flocks throughout the world. Mesoamerican priests served as elite troops or commanders; Hindu brahmins who were unable to find posts as priests took up arms as mercenary soldiers; and Buddhist warrior monks fought alongside the samurai of Japan. Priests also fought with other soldiers during the Middle Ages. For example, during the A.D. 1066 Norman Conquest of England, a warrior bishop accompanied the invasion force, wearing a chain mail hauberk and armed with a heavy spiked club. Christian holy men were forbidden by their religion to shed blood, so the club and mace were popular weapons with them. principe: The soldiers in the middle rank of a Roman three-line military formation. rank and file: Companies of soldiers parade, or maneuver, in ranks and files. Ranks go from left to right, and files go from front to rear. In European armies, junior soldiers were called rankers as opposed to their officers, who took up their posts outside of the mass of soldiers lined up in ranks and files. razor women: An elite force of female soldiers employed by the king of Dahomey, Africa, most notably in the nineteenth century. At times this force may have been utilized as a special bodyguard, but at one point it was 2,400 strong and apparently battle-ready. Their main weapons were long, two-handed razors, called nyek-ple-nen-toh, which could fold into their hafts like giant straight razors. See blunderbuss woman. regiment: A grouping of several companies under a staff of additional officers (typically a major, lieutenant colonel and colonel). In the sixteenth century when companies or band of soldiers were so grouped and placed under a staff, they were said to be regimented. scout: Soldiers deployed ahead of or to the sides of an army to detect the presence of the enemy.",

            "passage": "The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 1st century AD – 2nd century AD –\nBy 6 AD, the initial length of service for a Roman soldier (legionary) was increased to 20 years from 16 years, and it was complemented by the praemia militare (or discharge bonus), a lump sum that was increased to 12,000 sesterces (or 3,000 denarii). And by the middle of 1st century AD, the service was further extended to 25 years. Now beyond official service lengths, the protocols were rarely followed in times marked by wars. This resulted in retaining of the legionaries well beyond their service periods, with some men fighting under their legions for over three to four decades. Suffice it to say, such chaotic measures frequently resulted in mutinies. Many potential recruits were still drawn to the prospect of joining a legion because of the ‘booty factor’. In essence, many charismatic commanders touted the apparent prevalence of loot (and its ‘fair’ distribution), especially when conducting wars against the richer and powerful neighbors. According to Cicero, this might have been the prime factor that motivated the disparate troops under Marc Antony. The popular practice also alludes to the penchant for plundering – with the soldiers tending to strip the dead as the very first act after achieving victory over their foes. However, the life of a legionary was not all about triumphs, mutinies, and plundering. There were definitely some progressive measures put forth by the Romans when it came to bravery. For example, if the soldier was severely injured and couldn’t continue further with his military tenure, he was given a missio causaria or medical discharge that was equivalent to honorable discharge or honesta missio. This in turn equated to a societal status that was higher than ordinary civilians, which made the discharged legionary exempt from taxes and other civic duties. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 3rd century AD –\nWhile Roman legions fighting with their full capacity was a regular occurrence during early 2nd century AD, by the middle of the 3rd century the conflicts faced by the Roman Empire (and the changing emperors) were volatile from both the geographical and logistical scope. And so it was uncommon and rather impractical for the entire legion to leave its provincial base to fight a ‘distant’ war on the shifting frontiers of 3rd century AD. As a solution, the Roman military commanders sanctioned the use of vexillationes – detachments from individual legions that could be easily transferred without compromising the core strength of a legion (which was needed for fortifying and policing its ‘native’ province). These mobile combat ‘divisions’, comprising one or two cohorts, were usually tasked with handling the smaller enemy forces while being also used for garrisoning duties along strategic points like roads, bridges, and forts. And on rare occasions when the Romans were faced by a large number of opposing troops, many of these different vexillationes were combined to form a bigger field army. Moreover, the importance of detachments was not only limited to the combat-duty bound vexillationes. Emperor Gallienus (who ruled alone from 260 to 268 AD) created his own mobile field army consisting of special detachments from the praetorians, legio II Parthica, and other guard units. Hailed as the comitatus (retinue), this central reserve force functioned under the emperor’s direct command, thus hinting at the ambit of insecurities faced by the Roman rulers and elites during the ‘Crisis of the Third Century’. Interestingly enough, many of ‘extra’ equites (cavalry) that were assigned to each conventional legion, were also inducted as the elite promoti cavalry in the already opulent (and the militarily capable) scope of the comitatus.",

            "passage": "In fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).",

At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.",

            "passage": "For a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.",

Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.",

The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 3rd century BC – late 2nd century BC –\nThe military overhaul, indicating the transition from phalanx formations to manipular ones, is sometimes referred to as the Polybian reform (especially in the post 290 BC period). By this time, the citizen militia (or soldiers) of Republican Rome were levied and then assembled in the Capitol on the day that was proclaimed by the Consuls in their edictum. This process was known as dilectus, and interestingly the men volunteers were arranged in terms of their similar heights and age. This brought orderliness in terms of physical appearance, while similar equipment (if not uniform) made the organized soldiers look even more ‘homogeneous’. The Roman army recruits also had to swear an oath of obedience, which was known as sacramentum dicere. This symbolically bound them with the Roman state, their commander, and more importantly to their fellow comrades-in-arms. In terms of historical tradition, this oath was only formalized before the commencement of the Battle of Cannae, to uphold the faltering morale of the Hannibal-afflicted Roman army. According to Livy, the oath went somewhat like this – “Never to leave the ranks because of fear or to run away, but only to retrieve or grab a weapon, to kill an enemy or to rescue a comrade.”\nHowever in spite of oaths and morale-drumming exercises, the bloody day of the Battle of Cannae accounted for over 40,000 Roman deaths (the figure is put at 55,000 by Livy, and 70,000 by Polybius), which equated to over 80 percent of the Roman army fielded in the battle. Now, according to modern estimation, the male population of Rome circa 216 BC was around 400,000. So, considering the number of casualties at the Battle of Cannae, the baleful figures pertained to 5 to 10 percent of the total number of Roman males in the Republic (considering there were also Italic allies present in the battle) – with all the casualties occurring in a single day! The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa 1st century BC –\nThe last phase of the Roman Republic was marked by yet another military overhaul, better known as the Marian reforms (circa 107 BC). Alluding to a far more influential course of action than the previous centuries of military reorganizations, these reforms resulted in the military inclusion of the capite censi, the landless Romans who were now assessed in the census and counted as potential recruits that could bolster the army. Consequently, the state was responsible for providing the arms and equipment to these previously disfranchised masses, thus allowing many of the poorer men to be employed as professional soldiers of the burgeoning Roman realm. The reforms also focused on the formation of a standing army, as opposed to conscripted militias who were available seasonally within the timeframe of a year. Furthermore, the amends also touched upon the provision of retirement pensions and land grants to military men who had completed their terms of service. Suffice it to say, the series of reforms credibly improved the prowess of the Roman military machine, especially with the adoption of standardized equipment and training of most ranks of soldiers. Simply put, by the end of this epoch, the Roman legions were far more uniform in their appearance, while adopting systematic policies, orderly discipline, and reliable battlefield tactics. On the flip side, the Marian reforms indirectly paved the way for the fall of the Roman Republic. The legions, by virtue of their intrinsic organization and habitual fraternity, were more loyal to their ambitious generals than the state and Senate. In essence, this was the very same epoch that was witness to the ‘alarming’ triumphs of the soldiers of Julius Caesar, Pompey and Marc Antony (as opposed to the ‘collective’ armies of Rome).",

Julius Caesar took his last breath on the Senate steps and the Roman world - not to mention ours - was changed forever. There's only one problem. When Julius Caesar was assassinated in March 15th, 44 BC, the Senate House no longer existed. The old timber senate building had been burnt to the ground in early 52 BC when angry supporters of Clodius made the building his funeral pyre. So - the long and short of it - Julius Caesar did not die on the steps of a building that did not exist. So where did the end of Caesar come? For several years the Senate had been meeting in Pompey's theatre, several blocks away. It had a prominent entry, but like most theatres it had a back door leading out to a lane-way. And guess who got knifed coming through the back door? Julius Caesar more or less died in an alleyway. Not quite what you see in most documentaries or movies. Et tu, Brute!

When Hannibal's Punic forces were overwhelmed in October 202 BC, Rome imposed a war reparations tax on Carthage of 800,000lbs of silver spread over fifty years...gold was excluded from the deal.

Silver set the standard for the finance trade and was pressed into the Denarius (the Roman equivalent of the $100 note in the late Republic) for several centuries. Because of its importance to the value of the Roman currency, silver - and the lead it was mined with - were state controlled by the 1st-century AD; over-production would have decreased the value of the denarius while under-production would have driven inflation...concepts the Roman Treasury was just as aware of as today's modern treasury officials. So the mining of silver - and finding new mines - was particularly important to the Roman Empire. Much of this mining was focused in Spain where some shafts produced over 300lb (around $2.1-million worth) of silver per day...however as the Empire expanded, a considerable percentage of production was shifted to Britain. It is quite possible the underlying reason Claudius committed to the invasion of Britain was to keep the Roman currency stable. Trajan's invasion of Dacia was also driven by mining...and the fact the Roman Empire went into a long inflation-driven decline in the years after expansionism ended suggests the economy was unable to produce enough silver to sustain the currency's value.

    "text": "Wine Lefkadia, \"Likuriya\" Red Reviews of purchase Lefkadia, \"Likuriya\" Red The wine is intense cherry color with sparkling clarity. The taste of wine is rounded, fruity, balanced, with soft tannins, a nice refreshing acidity, hints of green pepper and prunes. The rich aroma of the wine is filled with tones of red plums and cherries, dried fruits and vanilla. The wine should be served with dishes of poultry, meats, hot dishes, red and white meat. Dry red wine \"Lykouria\" is an ordinary wine, which is made from grapes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Wine has a rich cherry color and rich aroma with hints of dried fruit, red plum, vanilla and cherry. It is perfectly suited to dishes of poultry, meats, hot dishes, red and white meat. Once upon a time in ancient Greece there was a peninsula of Lefkada, which was inhabited by Greek colonists. He was famous for its limestone soils on which the grapes cultivated magnificent, from which, in turn, created a good wine. Therefore motives myths of ancient Greece played a large role in creating the company \"Lefkadia.\" Its logo is decorated mascaron, which is divided into dark and light halves, showing how differently wine affects a person, reflecting a light or dark side of his soul. The bright side represents Dionysus, dark - Faun Silenus. Winery \"Lefkadia\" was founded in 2006 in the Krasnodar region, in the village of Moldavanskoye. On the territory of the winery is located cheesecake, made of olive oil, \"Olga Lefkas\", cultivated wheat, clover, sweet clover are grown ecologically clean seasonal vegetables, fruits and berries. Vineyards \"Lefkada\" occupy 80 hectares on the southern slopes of the Caucasus at a height of 140-240 meters above sea level. They cultivated 23 varieties of grapes, also on the territory of the winery has a nursery where cultivated both imported and Russian varieties of grapes. All the works in the vineyards are conducted exclusively by hand. Wines \"Lefkada\" made using gravitational techniques of winemaking, which excludes the use of forced transfer of grape must and wine, the whole process is \"gravity\" (under the influence of Earth's gravity). With ultra-modern winery built laboratory complex for the analysis of soils and wines, having no analogues in Central or Eastern Europe. The Laboratory has been certified in the Krasnodar region of the state regional center of standardization, metrology and testing.",

    "answer": "As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or tastes, but I can provide information based on available data.\n\nLikuriya is a South African wine brand that produces various wine types, including red wines. Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific tasting notes for Likuriya red wines, as they might not be well-known outside of South Africa or their wine might not be widely available globally.\n\nHowever, South African red wines generally have profiles that can vary greatly depending on the grape varieties used and the region they are from. Common varieties for red wines in South Africa include Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage (a unique South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault), and Shiraz\/Syrah.\n\nHere's a generalized taste profile for red wines commonly produced in South Africa, which might be similar to what you'd find in a Likuriya red wine:\n\n1. **Cabernet Sauvignon**: Often described as having dark fruit flavors (blackberries, blackcurrants), with hints of chocolate, tobacco, and cedar. Tannic structure varies, but can be firm, making it a good match for rich, red meats like beef and lamb.\n\n2. **Pinotage**: Typically exhibits flavors of dark fruits (plums, black cherries), floral notes (especially roses), and sometimes a sweet or jammy quality. Food pairings might include roasted meats, mushroom dishes, or strong cheeses due to its rich and fruity character.\n\n3. **Shiraz\/Syrah**: Often characterized by dark fruit flavors (blackberries, plums), spice (pepper, cinnamon), and sometimes a floral note. These wines can be quite full-bodied and high in tannins, making them great partners for equally bold flavors like grilled steak, spicy dishes, or game meats.\n\nFor food pairings, consider these general guidelines:\n- **Cabernet Sauvignon**: Goes well with grilled meats, stews, strong cheeses, and hearty dishes with rich sauces.\n- **Pinotage**: Ideal with rich, spicy dishes, smoked meats, mushroom-based dishes, and some aged cheeses.\n- **Shiraz\/Syrah**: Matches beautifully with barbecued meats, spicy cuisine, and dishes with bold flavors like game meats or robust vegetable dishes.\n\nSince specific details about Likuriya's red wines are not readily available, these descriptions are based on typical characteristics of South African red wines and should provide a good starting point for understanding the possible taste profiles and potential food pairings.\n\nFor the most accurate tasting notes and recommendations, I'd suggest reaching out to a sommelier or consulting a wine expert familiar with Likuriya wines. They can provide you with the latest information on their offerings.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Pairing Food and Wine\nThrow out the old rules-of-thumb\nThere are a whole bunch of rules-of thumb that have developed over the years\n- Serve white wine with fish or white meat and red wine with red meat\n- Serve red wine at room temperature (whatever that might be)\n- You only decant red wine\n- Serve white wine cold\nAll of which only have the tiniest speck of truth, if any at all. Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world \/ old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.\n\nAnd the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.\n\nWine is meant to have a partner. Food. As the two enter their union, the full flavors of both the wine and food stretch throughout all of the lovely layers and deepen the satiation and satisfaction of the dining experience. When I am in Bend, I look to our local grocer Newport Market to help me pick out my wine and trust the wine buyers there to not only recommend but share what they love about a particular wine. If I am picking out a wine to pair with a dish I have never made, I look no further than Suzi who has always steered me in delicious directions. From pairing with seafood to trout to lamb to paella, she suggests varying price points and leaves me to decide. Perhaps that is the key as well, know who to ask and who to trust for recommendations. For nine years when I lived near Walla Walla, Washington’s nearly 100 wineries, I trusted my own palate as we would visit the tasting rooms, often without a fee (and if there was a fee, it was $5 that could go toward your wine purchase), but that option is not available unless I travel now that I live in central Oregon – which perhaps is yet another reason to travel. 🙂\nHowever, to stick to hard-and-fast rules about what wine should go with what, while something to consider and inquire as to why, shouldn’t be adhered to absolutely nor blindly. Drink what you like, like what you drink was often a motto I would hear and for the most part, agree with. What I would add would be to just remember to pair it with food you enjoy as well. The entire flavor profile of the wine and the food when partnered, as mentioned above, changes, and often those traditional pairing suggestions reveal their wisdom. From something as simple as a luscious red cabernet-blend paired with a hamburger nestled between a brioche bun to a bouillabaisse paired with a light, crisp sauvignon blanc or viognier, if there is food, there is a wine that will pair with it and the experience will be all the more scrumptious and memorable because of it. There are many books available to deepen your knowledge of wine. Depending upon what your sense of humor, depth of curiosity and any other preference, there is a book for you. I have gathered up a few below.

Learn more about how to enter here. Image: TSLL’s Soufflé au Fromage avec Champagne\nPREVIOUS POSTS from TSLL’s 5th Annual French Week\n\nYou may have noticed that we've begun to incorporate pairing suggestions with some of our products, beginning with our red meats, like a Bonanza Cabernet Sauvignon by Caymus with our Chuck Roast (one of Bryce's favorites). We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red\/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!\n\nA simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

What We’re Reading…\n- Something different: We owe Milli Vanilli an apology.\n\nReserve Wine & Food Pairings\nFort Berens Reserve Wine Pairings\nAt Fort Berens, we offer a wide range of wines each with a distinct style. Over the years, we have been able to cultivate and refine our approaches in the vineyard and cellar and have expanded our collection to include a full series of small lot, ultra premium reserve wines which express the unique terroir of our region. We have currated for you here a quick reference to some food pairing suggestions that we think would work wonderfully with these wines. Chardonnay Reserve (White Gold)\nWine style: dry, crisp, with juicy acidity, fruit forward, medium body, oaked\nFood pairings: Enjoy with a stuffed roast chicken, potatoes au gratin, or for the ultimate luxury, lobster. Wine style: off-dry, crisp, with higher acidity and minerality, fruit forward, concentrated, medium body\nFood pairings: Enjoy the Riesling Reserve with spicy Pad Thai, cheese fondue, or a rich and creamy Alfredo sauce over linguine. Wine style: rich, velvety, full bodied, long and intense finish, plush tannins\nFood pairings: Red Gold is the perfect wine to pair with your finest cuts of beef or big game. Enjoy this bold wine with a well-marbeled porterhouse steak or hearty moose stew. Pinot Noir Reserve\nWine style: concentrated, savoury earthy flavours, bright cherry fruit, elegant, long finish\nFood pairings: While a fireplace is not required, it is certainly recommended while enjoying this wine paired with a fire-roasted tomato lentil stew, grilled salmon, or roasted duck. Cabernet Franc Reserve\nWine style: opulent blueberry and blackberry aromas, purple floral perfume, medium body, ripe tannins, long finish\nFood pairings: This wine pairs beautifully with lamb, duck, or tomato and basil pizza. Wine style: Earthy, intensly structured, powerful, high acidity and tannins, boldy flavourful\nFood pairings: Enjoy this wine with roasted lamb, spaghetti bolognese, or lasagna.\n\nWhat wine goes best to what food is a question that generates different, therefore inspired opinions, Jamie Goode (a writer on wines from the United Kingdom) generalizes the views on marriage of wine and food in four categories. What is the marriage of wine and food? The marriage of wine and food is the process of “marrying” (metaphorically) a food with a wine with the intention of enhancing the pleasure of eating them. The main concept behind pairings is that certain elements of the food and wines, such as texture and flavor, react differently to the mix; and find the right combination of these will make dining a more pleasurable experience for the palate. Positions on the pairing of food and wine\nNihilist: “everything is a lovey-dovey.”\nIt is the most extreme but minority position. These people think that all the writings about the relationship between food and wine is lying, since never put in the mouth the wine and food at the same time. Legalistic: “it’s an exact with a set of specific science”. It is the traditional position, adopted by the classical works of authors like Hugh Johnson(an expert British writer about wine). Some books dedicated whole chapters to outline the best kinds of wine for each food product. The problem with this position is that focuses on classic wines of yesteryear and they do not take into account the current options. Anarchist: “break all rules”. This is the position that is becoming fashionable. According to them, drinking wine with fish is OK.\nOr if you drink Sauvignon Blanc with meat, it is also good. There are no rules and everything depends on the consumer. Pragmatista: “there are good and bad matches.”\nFor them, there are some rules of pairing between wine and food. For example, white wines taste best with fish, red wine with red meat. One of the areas where there is greater divergence of views is the level of quality of food and wines. A common view is that it is necessary to choose who is going to be the Star: food and wine. According to this point of view, it is better to accompany fine wines with simple dishes that do not have strong flavors that make competition. The alternative view is that best corresponds with the best: fine wines with first class food. They believe that excellent food and excellent wines have a natural affinity. As the saying goes, thumbs there is nothing written, so we invite you to tell us what your position is. Do you identify with one of these four profiles? Or do you feel that your way of pairing is different?\n\nFinger-licking chlli bites, beef biltong, droëwors, cabanossi and BBQ bites go down well with their sweet and dryer wine counterparts.

Macaroon and MCC, Canto\n“Paire parfaite” is French for “the perfect pair” and the term was probably invented to describe two of their finest delicacies: macaroons and champagne. The South African version of champagne is of course Méthode Cap Classique, and although the winery is brand new, Canto has created four delicious varieties. In a modern tasting room you get to match their MCC with four distinct flavours of sweet macaroons to enhance your delight. The Chardonnay MCC Brut is paired with a hazelnut macaroon and highlights the wonderful earthy undertone. The Shiraz Rosé MCC is one of only three of its type in the country and is a very interesting match with the red velvet macaroon. A favourite is the moreish Turkish Delight macaroon with the Pinot Noir MCC and to end it off the classic Chardonnay\/Pinot Noir MCC is enjoyed with the salted caramel macaroon.

Creation is the trend-setters for pairing experiences, and their “The Story of Creation” is a five-course, eight wine dining affair that will take you through a medley of taste sensations. Their story has five chapters, starting out on a peachy note, getting heavier and more complex as the plot thickens, before it ends with an elegant touch. They have more than ten other pairing options available, from vegan to brunch, charcuterie and even alcohol-free.

Robertson Wine Route\n18. ClemenGold and Wine, Zandvliet\nZesty, aromatic and fresh. These are all tasting terms that could be used to describe either wine, or ClemenGold, a special type of soft citrus fruit. That’s why the flavours blend so well. The distinctive taste of the juicy, sun-ripened citrus have been infused into four sweet delicacies that Zandvliet wines are effortlessly pairing with their wines. The spicy panforte with candied peel matches the golden Chardonnay, The Kalkveld Shiraz works its magic with the biscotti, their special Vintage Liqueur partners with the dark chocolate, and the Muscat is paired with the ClemenGold marmalade. They say you can’t mix apples and oranges, but grapes and citrus could certainly work. 19. Taste the Difference, Esona\nBefore going into the details of the multi-faceted pairing, the setting of the tasting is something you should know about. It is one of a kind experience, set in a 95 year old, rustic, dark underground cellar with their 'kuipe' (vintage cement fermentation tanks) still in place. By candlelight, you get to taste their three soft wines, twice. Why a second time? Well, they want you to compare the taste of the wine in an ordinary wine glass, with a grape-specific crystal glass, called a ‘riedel’. Apparently the difference is remarkable. Each of the wines are then also paired with a different confectionary, including Lindt chocolates and local fruit preserves. But that’s not all. Esona also incorporates your senses of hearing and sight, by playing music to suit each varietal and showcasing an art piece with each tasting. Simon and Garfunkel will match the relaxed Sauvignon Blank, with the Chardonnay leaning towards country music and classical music ending off the Shiraz. 20. Christina Master Tasting, Van Loveren\nAt Van Loveren the focus is on having a great time. You can go the relaxed route and enjoy your platter-pairing on your own, or select the tutored option, throwing a wine pairing guide into the equation.\n\nLast week we asked our fans on Facebook if they had a question for Executive Chef Justin Wangler. The response was great, and we got questions about food and wine pairings, best techniques in the kitchen, and favorite recipes. Chef Justin personally read each question and was quick to respond. But because there were so many questions, we thought it’d be best to compile them here to be a resource for our community. If you have any more questions, let us know on Facebook and Twitter, or below in the comments. Cheers. 1. Chef Justin, my favorite varietal is Riesling (on the sweet side). Usually, I have the urge of drinking it with any and every dish possible. Do you recommend against it? What should I REALLY be drinking it with? Thanks! –Daniella G\nIf you like Riesling, keep rocking it. Riesling is a great food wine and often lends itself to the dish. I really enjoy the K-J Riesling with spicy food and slightly sweet dishes. It’s always fun to mix it up and try new things. The great thing about wine is there is always more to learn and taste. 2. Chef, which wine do you recommend for a big BBQ beef brisket sandwich? –Larry H.\nI would enjoy some fine brisket with a Syrah or Zinfandel. The both have some nice fruit but also a bit of tannins to hold up to the rich, smoky brisket. 3. What is your favorite dish for the holiday family dinner? And what wine would you serve with it? –Lorraine A\n4. Is there a kind of wine that is best for gift giving? One that is perhaps more popular than others, –Marianne C\nI like to give Pinot Noir as a gift because it’s very popular, and also lends itself well to lots of different foods. 5. What is your favorite ingredient to use from the K-J garden? –Jessica R\nMy favorite ingredients vary from season to season. This time of year we really enjoy using Fuyu persimmons; we like to call it the “winter tomato.” I really like Fuyu persimmons raw & sliced in salads. Overall, my favorite thing is to watch the asparagus grow in the garden. Check out our time lapse video of asparagus growing. 6. What’s your favorite dish to make for your family? –Meredith H\nAt home in Sonoma county I like to cook wild local salmon when in season. If I sear the salmon I usually serve it with K-J Grand Reserve Chardonnay and if I throw it on the grill and get a bit of smoke on it I like to pair with the K-J Vintners Reserve Pinot Noir. My wife and daughter also love the fatty salmon belly brushed with Meyer lemon olive oil sprinkled with salt and roasted at a low temp in the oven until just cooked. 7. I am always searching for a good wine. I like reds and whites, nothing too sweet or too dry. The best way for me to describe it is smooth, buttery & creamy very little or no bite. I steer clear of anything that sounds like it might have too much oak taste. Any suggestions? –Carol H.\nIt’s sounds like you are describing our Grand Reserve Chardonnay. It has great fruit, light on the oak and a wonderful round, rich texture. 8. What’s the hardest dish\/food to combine with wine? –Marine R\nExtremely spicy foods can be tricky (for example,Trinidad Scorpion Morouga peppers — there are some funny videos online!). Artichokes are a notoriously tricky one because they can make whatever you eat or drink afterwards taste sweet, but they can be quite good when paired with the right wine. It’s fun to play around tasting artichokes with different wines, such as a crisp wine like Sauvignon Blanc, a rich Chardonnay or maybe even an off-dry wine that has it’s own sweetness. 9. Chef, is there an easy way to cut the slices from an orange without getting any membrane and ruining most of the slice? –John B\nSegmenting an orange is a simple process, but it’s a little tough to explain. Here’s a great video I found from Fine Cooking on YouTube.\n\nSo try to match the aromatic intensity of both elements:\n- Low aromatic intensity meals (oysters, seashell,…) >> low aromatic intensity wines (Blanc de Blancs Champagne, Muscadet, Chenin Blanc,…)\n- Strong aromatic intensity meals (game,…) >> aromatic wines (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah,…)\nFat and acidity\nAnother thing you can play with is fat and acidity. Fat food will tend to get heavy on your palate, whereas wine’s acidity will cut through it and refresh your palate. Creamy meals, junk food or chocolate >> acidic wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc,… for whites; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Pinot Noir,… for reds)\nRegional food & wine pairings\nThe last thing I want to tell you is that « what grows together goes together ». So consider doing regional food and wine pairings. The classic French examples are:\n- goat’s crottin from Chavignol with Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé\n- oysters with Muscadet Sèvre-et-Maine\n- foie gras with Loupiac or Monbazillac\n- comté cheese with Vin Jaune\n- Burgundy beef stew with bourgogne Pinot Noir,…\nFinal advice: just have fun! 😉\nNow you know there are plenty of things to take into account when you pair food with wine: personal sensitivies, preferences, basic rules… But since everyone is different, some people might actually enjoy strong or unusual associations. In fact, most people will like most food with most wines. Don’t lock yourself up into the classic pairings like red wine with meat and white wine with fish… Just try new things, be adventurous and have fun! Worst case scenario: your pairing doesn’t work. So what? Now you know it doesn’t work, next time you’ll try something else! At least you tried something, instead of playing it safe and never discover anything!! Well, that’s all for today! I hope this will help you make better pairings for you and your loved ones! Now, I’d love to hear from you. What’s your favourite food and wine pairing of all time? Do you rather follow these rules or play it wild? Let me know in the comments below! Thank you so much for watching this episode and I’ll see you soon on Wine by Alex!

            "passage": "Pairing Food and Wine\nThrow out the old rules-of-thumb\nThere are a whole bunch of rules-of thumb that have developed over the years\n- Serve white wine with fish or white meat and red wine with red meat\n- Serve red wine at room temperature (whatever that might be)\n- You only decant red wine\n- Serve white wine cold\nAll of which only have the tiniest speck of truth, if any at all. Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world \/ old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.",

            "passage": "And the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.",

            "passage": "Wine is meant to have a partner. Food. As the two enter their union, the full flavors of both the wine and food stretch throughout all of the lovely layers and deepen the satiation and satisfaction of the dining experience. When I am in Bend, I look to our local grocer Newport Market to help me pick out my wine and trust the wine buyers there to not only recommend but share what they love about a particular wine. If I am picking out a wine to pair with a dish I have never made, I look no further than Suzi who has always steered me in delicious directions. From pairing with seafood to trout to lamb to paella, she suggests varying price points and leaves me to decide. Perhaps that is the key as well, know who to ask and who to trust for recommendations. For nine years when I lived near Walla Walla, Washington’s nearly 100 wineries, I trusted my own palate as we would visit the tasting rooms, often without a fee (and if there was a fee, it was $5 that could go toward your wine purchase), but that option is not available unless I travel now that I live in central Oregon – which perhaps is yet another reason to travel. 🙂\nHowever, to stick to hard-and-fast rules about what wine should go with what, while something to consider and inquire as to why, shouldn’t be adhered to absolutely nor blindly. Drink what you like, like what you drink was often a motto I would hear and for the most part, agree with. What I would add would be to just remember to pair it with food you enjoy as well. The entire flavor profile of the wine and the food when partnered, as mentioned above, changes, and often those traditional pairing suggestions reveal their wisdom. From something as simple as a luscious red cabernet-blend paired with a hamburger nestled between a brioche bun to a bouillabaisse paired with a light, crisp sauvignon blanc or viognier, if there is food, there is a wine that will pair with it and the experience will be all the more scrumptious and memorable because of it. There are many books available to deepen your knowledge of wine. Depending upon what your sense of humor, depth of curiosity and any other preference, there is a book for you.

            "passage": "You may have noticed that we've begun to incorporate pairing suggestions with some of our products, beginning with our red meats, like a Bonanza Cabernet Sauvignon by Caymus with our Chuck Roast (one of Bryce's favorites). We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red\/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!",

            "passage": "A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

            "passage": "What wine goes best to what food is a question that generates different, therefore inspired opinions, Jamie Goode (a writer on wines from the United Kingdom) generalizes the views on marriage of wine and food in four categories. What is the marriage of wine and food? The marriage of wine and food is the process of “marrying” (metaphorically) a food with a wine with the intention of enhancing the pleasure of eating them. The main concept behind pairings is that certain elements of the food and wines, such as texture and flavor, react differently to the mix; and find the right combination of these will make dining a more pleasurable experience for the palate. Positions on the pairing of food and wine\nNihilist: “everything is a lovey-dovey.”\nIt is the most extreme but minority position. These people think that all the writings about the relationship between food and wine is lying, since never put in the mouth the wine and food at the same time. Legalistic: “it’s an exact with a set of specific science”. It is the traditional position, adopted by the classical works of authors like Hugh Johnson(an expert British writer about wine). Some books dedicated whole chapters to outline the best kinds of wine for each food product. The problem with this position is that focuses on classic wines of yesteryear and they do not take into account the current options. Anarchist: “break all rules”. This is the position that is becoming fashionable. According to them, drinking wine with fish is OK.\nOr if you drink Sauvignon Blanc with meat, it is also good. There are no rules and everything depends on the consumer. Pragmatista: “there are good and bad matches.”\nFor them, there are some rules of pairing between wine and food. For example, white wines taste best with fish, red wine with red meat. One of the areas where there is greater divergence of views is the level of quality of food and wines. A common view is that it is necessary to choose who is going to be the Star: food and wine. According to this point of view, it is better to accompany fine wines with simple dishes that do not have strong flavors that make competition. The alternative view is that best corresponds with the best: fine wines with first class food. They believe that excellent food and excellent wines have a natural affinity. As the saying goes, thumbs there is nothing written, so we invite you to tell us what your position is. Do you identify with one of these four profiles? Or do you feel that your way of pairing is different?",

The response was great, and we got questions about food and wine pairings, best techniques in the kitchen, and favorite recipes. Chef Justin personally read each question and was quick to respond. But because there were so many questions, we thought it’d be best to compile them here to be a resource for our community. If you have any more questions, let us know on Facebook and Twitter, or below in the comments. Cheers. 1. Chef Justin, my favorite varietal is Riesling (on the sweet side). Usually, I have the urge of drinking it with any and every dish possible. Do you recommend against it? What should I REALLY be drinking it with? Thanks! –Daniella G\nIf you like Riesling, keep rocking it. Riesling is a great food wine and often lends itself to the dish. I really enjoy the K-J Riesling with spicy food and slightly sweet dishes. It’s always fun to mix it up and try new things. The great thing about wine is there is always more to learn and taste. 2. Chef, which wine do you recommend for a big BBQ beef brisket sandwich? –Larry H.\nI would enjoy some fine brisket with a Syrah or Zinfandel. The both have some nice fruit but also a bit of tannins to hold up to the rich, smoky brisket. 3. What is your favorite dish for the holiday family dinner? And what wine would you serve with it? –Lorraine A\n4. Is there a kind of wine that is best for gift giving? One that is perhaps more popular than others, –Marianne C\nI like to give Pinot Noir as a gift because it’s very popular, and also lends itself well to lots of different foods. 5. What is your favorite ingredient to use from the K-J garden? –Jessica R\nMy favorite ingredients vary from season to season. This time of year we really enjoy using Fuyu persimmons; we like to call it the “winter tomato.” I really like Fuyu persimmons raw & sliced in salads. Overall, my favorite thing is to watch the asparagus grow in the garden. Check out our time lapse video of asparagus growing. 6. What’s your favorite dish to make for your family? –Meredith H\nAt home in Sonoma county I like to cook wild local salmon when in season. If I sear the salmon I usually serve it with K-J Grand Reserve Chardonnay and if I throw it on the grill and get a bit of smoke on it I like to pair with the K-J Vintners Reserve Pinot Noir. My wife and daughter also love the fatty salmon belly brushed with Meyer lemon olive oil sprinkled with salt and roasted at a low temp in the oven until just cooked. 7. I am always searching for a good wine. I like reds and whites, nothing too sweet or too dry. The best way for me to describe it is smooth, buttery & creamy very little or no bite. I steer clear of anything that sounds like it might have too much oak taste. Any suggestions? –Carol H.\nIt’s sounds like you are describing our Grand Reserve Chardonnay. It has great fruit, light on the oak and a wonderful round, rich texture. 8. What’s the hardest dish\/food to combine with wine? –Marine R\nExtremely spicy foods can be tricky (for example,Trinidad Scorpion Morouga peppers — there are some funny videos online!). Artichokes are a notoriously tricky one because they can make whatever you eat or drink afterwards taste sweet, but they can be quite good when paired with the right wine. It’s fun to play around tasting artichokes with different wines, such as a crisp wine like Sauvignon Blanc, a rich Chardonnay or maybe even an off-dry wine that has it’s own sweetness. 9. Chef, is there an easy way to cut the slices from an orange without getting any membrane and ruining most of the slice? –John B\nSegmenting an orange is a simple process, but it’s a little tough to explain. Here’s a great video I found from Fine Cooking on YouTube.",

Fat food will tend to get heavy on your palate, whereas wine’s acidity will cut through it and refresh your palate. Creamy meals, junk food or chocolate >> acidic wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc,… for whites; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Pinot Noir,… for reds)\nRegional food & wine pairings\nThe last thing I want to tell you is that « what grows together goes together ». So consider doing regional food and wine pairings. The classic French examples are:\n- goat’s crottin from Chavignol with Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé\n- oysters with Muscadet Sèvre-et-Maine\n- foie gras with Loupiac or Monbazillac\n- comté cheese with Vin Jaune\n- Burgundy beef stew with bourgogne Pinot Noir,…\nFinal advice: just have fun! 😉\nNow you know there are plenty of things to take into account when you pair food with wine: personal sensitivies, preferences, basic rules… But since everyone is different, some people might actually enjoy strong or unusual associations. In fact, most people will like most food with most wines. Don’t lock yourself up into the classic pairings like red wine with meat and white wine with fish… Just try new things, be adventurous and have fun! Worst case scenario: your pairing doesn’t work. So what? Now you know it doesn’t work, next time you’ll try something else! At least you tried something, instead of playing it safe and never discover anything!! Well, that’s all for today! I hope this will help you make better pairings for you and your loved ones! Now, I’d love to hear from you. What’s your favourite food and wine pairing of all time? Do you rather follow these rules or play it wild? Let me know in the comments below! Thank you so much for watching this episode and I’ll see you soon on Wine by Alex!

The group's second album, This Side, furthers the cause, seamlessly melding bluegrass and pop strains in a fashion that should attract new admirers even as some mountain-music purists grumble. But tradition is only one side of the Nickel Creek story, and This Side appropriately focuses more on the band's originals and clever covers. No one walks the pop-bluegrass intersect better than Alison Krauss, who returns to produce This Side, allowing the trio to stretch but reining them in before they get too far out there. And out there they venture. Their version of Carrie Newcomer's folkish bit of self-recrimination, \"I Should've Known Better,\" evokes the Beatles in its title, and Krauss's production frames Sara Watkins's delicate soprano in Fab Four touches, such as an \"Eleanor Rigby\"-style string quartet that plays dissonant retorts and swirling, ascending passages. The pop-folk-rock arrangement of \"Spit On a Stranger,\" from the pen of Pavement's Stephen Malkmus, includes some processed background voices and a snaking electric guitar line. Nickel Creek's originals, mostly written by mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile, are equally inspired. Thile's intriguing meditation on youthful love and commitment, \"Young,\" and his \"Brand New Sidewalk,\" a cautionary ballad addressing the pitfalls of fame (keyed by Sean Watkins's Leo Kottke-like riffs), are as emotionally honest as the musical elements are beautifully realized. Nickel Creek's reach oftentimes threatens to exceed their grasp, which makes the effort even more impressive when it works, as on \"Spit On a Stranger,\" where Thile strains to reach a high note and then nails it. Ultimately, they profit from the experience, emerging with something fresh and vital. This Side is a scintillating exercise in making music with muscle, meaning, and great heart. - Release Date:\n- Smoothie Song\n- Spit on a Stranger\n- Hanging by a Thread\n- Should've Known Better\n- This Side\n- Green and Gray\n- Seven Wonders\n- House Carpenter\n- Beauty and the Mess\n- Sabra Girl\n- Brand New Sidewalk\nPerformance CreditsNickel Creek Primary Artist\nEdgar Meyer Bass,Upright Bass\nByron House Acoustic Bass\nChris Thile Bouzouki,Guitar,Mandolin,Strings,Vocals,Vocal Harmony\nSara Watkins Fiddle,Strings,Vocals,Vocal Harmony\nSean Watkins Guitar,Vocals,Vocal Harmony\nTechnical CreditsAlison Krauss Producer\nNeal Cappellino Engineer\nGary Paczosa Engineer\nJason Lehning Engineer\nChris Thile Arranger\nTerry Hoff Illustrations\nSara Watkins Arranger\nSean Watkins Arranger\nWendy Stamberger Art Direction\nTracy Martinson Engineer\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\nSee all customer reviews\nI enjoyed their last CD, but this one is even better! It has a good mix of sounds, that even makes people that don't like country or blue grass like their CD! Nickel Creek has always been amazing, but this time they've truly done it. I listen to \"This Side\" everyday of my life. If i didn't Id die... They are so amazing and have only become more amazing. Nickel Creek is back, and perhaps we wish they would have figured out their own particular style by now. Maybe they have and there is no word for it yet. This album is a patchwork similar to the album preceding it. Lots of choices, and if you're good with the remote, you can program out the stuff that's really annoying to you. There are some good new sounds here - but the ones that soar are the ones with the harmonies, and there are just too few of these. Perhaps that's the point Nickel Creek is making - we'll do it our way. \"All they get of you is what they get out of the show. The rest is mine I guess the beauty and the mess to hide.\" (Beauty & the Mess, Track 10).\n\nBluegrass is one of the most diverse genres in the world of music. Bluegrass has influenced many different styles including rock, country, pop and even hip-hop! This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today’s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop\/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today’s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music.\n\nIf you like the jazzy-grass-folk-fusion instrumental pieces, my suggestions below may be places to continue on your quest. There is a tradition preceding (or paralleling) this aspect of Nickel Creek. Even Chris Thile's own effort, \"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\" (2001) is pretty solid. Buy that one first. I liked Nickel Creek's first effort but 'This Side' blew me away. Every track on this CD is terrific. For anyone who loves acoustic music with outstanding vocals, this is a must hear. Their instrumental tracks are great, but 1 or 2 per album is enough for me. The four tracks on their debut release was a little too much. Great Job Nickel Creek! I LOVED their first CD, and was waiting to get my hands on this CD. At first, I was a little hesitant as I listned to the songs. But, when I listened to it the second time, I fell in love with it. It's different, which is good. I enjoyed the first album but I think this album ventured to far from the roots of bluegrass\nNickel Creek's sophomore album does not disappoint. The songs live up to the band's energetic and lively playing! Kudos to the band for going out on a limb and daring to be adventurous in their song choices and interpretations. The title track stands out as well as their rendition of Carrie Newcomer's \"I Should've Known Better.\" We can only hope they will continue to sing and play for many more years! I was watching public television and saw their set...so young yet their sound is so captivating, I'm amazed at their ability to make such great music. After hearing them on TV, I had to buy the cd! folksie bluegrass diehards who obessed over the perfection of nickel creek's self-titled first release on sugar hill a few years back beware- you may be a bit angry not to find much bluegrass here. however, all the lame comments about nickel creek \"wandering too far from their roots\" are ubsurd and unfounded! the band members are from SoCal people, not your bluegrass capital of the world! however, keep an open mind, go through the album SLOWLY and DEEPLY, and you will be just as impressed as the first go around! Smoothie Song- is the only instrumental but is great, they need a few more ones like this on the album to round it out; Spit on a Stranger- not really my thing, but has attracted some new listeners i'm sure; Speak- gorgeous song, a lot like Sean's solo album (check that out too btw); Hanging By a Thread- Chris's voice is kinda funky here, and kinda makes you hurt; I Should've Known Better- awesome, love this song; This Side- another great example of why Sean should sing a lot more, his writing skills are really amasing! ; Green and Grey- really cool lyrics here... great imagery so i'll give it the best lyrics of the album nod; Seven Wonders- kinda sleepy but sits well with Sara's voice; House Carpenter- long but good for the traditionalist's sake; Beauty and the Mess- Sara steps out of her shell here, it's an awesome song; Sabra Girl- great cover, could stand to be a bit more 'celtic'; Young- nice lyrics, pretty song; Brand New Song- really deep, Chris's growth since the last time is apparent here... on the whole- GIVE IT A CHANCE.. it, just like the last one, will grow on you... as allison krauss said \"it's just nickel creek music\"\nWhat Can I Say That Hasn't Already Been Said About Nickel Creek. Thile Has Developed As One Of The Most Talented Songwriters and Vocalists In Years. Great Vocal Debut By Sean Watkins on ''This Side'' and ''Speak''. Sara Shines As Well. Not What I Expected, But How Could I Expect An Album Of Such Unbridled Talent & Genius. Tracks: 1. Smoothie Song- Not A Sign Of What Is To Come, but a fierce Instrumental None the Less. 2. Spit On A Stranger- Like Nothing You've Heard Before. One of the album's distinctive highlights. 3. Speak-Good Song...Well Done, but not a signature track. 4.\n\nThe last time I listened to Nickel Creek was to analyze their adaptation of Robert Burns’ poem, “Sweet Afton,” in my English literature class in college three years ago. Indeed, the waters of Nickel Creek flow gently, a trait reflected in “Sweet Afton” and many other Nickel Creek staples. And that general lack of bite, paired with an almost robotic mastery of each band members’ respective instrument, pushed me away from the band. So it was strange that, with no expectations and an arbitrarily negative perception of the classic folk band, I really enjoyed seeing Nickel Creek reunite in Washington, D.C. after a six-year hiatus. The show, in sum, was really, really good. I was sandwiched on the upper level between some high schoolers and a middle-aged man at the show with, presumably, his mom. Below us was a melting pot of folk music fans of all ages with one thing in common: they all love Nickel Creek. I didn’t realize so many people could love Nickel Creek so strongly, and I was blown away by the energy and participation of the crowd. The band thrived on the raucous sing alongs of the crowd and seemed to feel like it almost owed them a great performance. Everyone in the building was having a good time. I went to see Punch Brothers last spring at the same venue (the 9:30 Club in D.C.) and was blown away by the musicianship of all of the band’s members but especially its mandolin virtuoso and front man — Chris Thile — who also happens to be a member of Nickel Creek. The Nickel Creek performance followed suit, and each member provided stunning displays of technical mastery combined with emotional energy (usually fueled by the crowd), particularly on the instrumental tunes peppered throughout the set. The band played all of their hits (see their “best of” album, Reasons Why: The Very Best) for what comprised most of their set list. They threw in a few nice new tunes like “Destination” and “Love of Mine” for good measure, but the crowd definitely enjoyed hearing some of the more popular songs like “The Lighthouse’s Tale” and “When in Rome.”\nAll in all, great show from a great band, and who knows how long they’ll be on tour for in the future — fans had to wait six years up until a few months ago. Here’s to hoping there’s still more to come from an already prolific folk band. Brandon Hook is the Web and Multimedia Associtae at Sojourners.\n\nNickel Creek: A Dotted Line\n“There are worse ways\/ to start\/ the first day, of the rest of my life,” Chris Thile sings, and A Dotted Line begins. It’s been seven years since Nickel Creek was a touring band, 11 since they won a Grammy under Alison Krauss’ helm, and 25 since they first formed. This isn’t a requisite reunion, but rather the outpouring of a band at their peak. Having garnered cult status because of their talent, Nickel Creek always eluded mainstream success because they didn’t write typical hits, even of the Mumford variety. Thile is a genius on the mandolin, who—combined with Sean Watkin’s country guitar and sister Sara's indie-conscious fiddling—recreates old folk for the 21st century. Fans of “Ode to a Butterfly” will find new favorites in “Elsie” and “Elephants in the Corn” (with Edgar Meyer on bass), but they’ll be most excited by “Hayloft.” The final tune is by the Canadian band Mother Mother, and the Nickel Creek cover retains all the weirdness and unusual arrangements of the original. The group excels at harmonies throughout, though Sara’s voice comes across best on the last track, Sam Phillips’ “Where is Love Now.” Other standouts include the classic “21st of May” and the cursed “Love of Mine,” but there’s not a song on the album that falls short. Each songwriter has circled back from the band's hiatus with a fully realized sound; they recorded A Dotted Line in a mere twelve days. This summer, fans everywhere will be celebrating the return of Nickel Creek.\n\nChris Thile is compiling a laundry list of impressive musical exploits ranging from participation in the bands Nickel Creek and The Punch Brothers to hosting A Prairie Home Companion. A common thread in much of what he tackles in his musical life seems to be progressivism. In his collaborations, Thile’s choices for his mandolin are unexpected and unconventional. When you are a musician of Thile’s caliber, however, unexpected and unconventional make for the most compelling musical offerings. Case in point, his recent collaboration with pianist Brad Mehldau.\n\nMusic comes in many different forms and not all of them are equally popular. Maybe you are into a specific type of music and maybe you like 1 or 2 genres more, but the thing is, most people prefer just one genre. This can be useful to new musicians, due to the fact they can start their career in the music genre that is most popular. This would definitely make the things easier. You may believe that POP music is the #1 in the world, but it isn’t. Now you will see the most popular music genres in the world. - Heavy Metal\nOnce treated as outcasts, the musicians of this genre are today the number one when it comes to the music popularity. They have the most fans across the planet, but in the United States, this number is even higher. Heavy Metal started its life back in the 60s, as a sub-genre of rock. Some of the best-known names in this genre are Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fans of this type of music are completely into it and their lifestyle is even based on Heavy Metal. - Rock n’ Roll\nRock n’ Roll has been one of the most popular music genres since the day it was invented. Let’s just say that the first traces of this music come from the 50s, but the popularity was significantly increased during the 70s and 80s. ACDC, G N R and many others have made this genre the ultimate choice for most people. This music is commonly produced by a drummer, a singer, bass player and a guitar player. - Alternative music\nThis music genre has no description, nor it can be described actually, simply because it is based on art. We all know that art cannot be defined. Linkin Park, Evanescence and many others made this music extremely popular and extremely desirable. You will need drummer, vocals and a guitar and you are good to go. This is also the hardest music genre to dominate. - Hard Rock\nThis genre isn’t the same as heavy metal or just rock. It is completely different in a matter of fact and it has a lot to offer. Rush, Led Zeppelin and literally, dozens of other bands made this genre the ultimate one if you want to enjoy the music, but at the same time, you want to listen to the beautiful words, great bass and to dance like you have never before. Classical music is still one of the most popular music genres ever. It is completely different than anything else and it is more than just beneficial to listen. Just relax in one of the best massage chairs, turn on the music and relax. First and foremost, this music is always produced by some of the biggest and the best musicians ever known. Mozart, Beethoven, and literally many others have shaped the classical music according to their beliefs. Now, we can simply enjoy that literally forever. And yes, this music is also known for increasing the IQ. Rap has been the most popular type of music in ghettoes, and in groups where people wanted to express themselves in an interesting and original way. This music may be the only kind that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. Since the time it has been first noticed, till now, it has made a significant improvement. Some of the biggest names here are Eminem, Tupac, Nas, Big L and etc. How many of you listen to the jazz music? Probably all of you have listened to it at least a few times in your life. The reason why is very simple. This is a gentle, sensitive music that is rich in feelings and always makes you think about something or someone. All artists from this genre are very popular and there are high chances this is going to be similar to the classical music in the near future. Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and many others have been responsible for some of the best songs ever. In addition, jazz originated from New Orleans and it has been made by slaves back in a day! - Electronic music\nCommonly known as dance music, or electronic dance music (EDM), is one of those genres that has to be on every list. It has been among us since the 80s, but in the 90s it got very desirable. The place of origin is Europe, but since 2000 electronic music has been introduced in the United States. Nowadays, it is the most common choice for crazy parties and nightclubs where people simply want to relax and dance. Here, words and vocals are not present. On the other side, thebass is something that has an important part. Pop music isn’t the most popular, as you can see, but the highest number of people talk about it every day.\n\nAN INDIE-DREAM POP MULTI-INSTRUMENTALIST PROJECT ‘CROISSANT’ BASED IN COVENTRY WHO WRITES,RECORDS AND PRODUCES HIS OWN SONGS – WE INTRODUCE YOU TO THE ARTIST BEHIND THE PROJECT ‘ETHAN HEASELDEN’.

Let us know what you think down below and who’s cover caught you off guard! Be sure to check out more music related articles here and keep on rockin’ on! I love Music. Possibly the most overstated sentence in the English language, as well as one of the most untrue. Typically followed by “except country” or “except rap” the statement “I love music” then becomes defunct. Now don’t get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their preference however one cannot simply dismiss an entire genre from having any good tunes because “I don’t listen to\/ like that genre.” Likewise, “I love music” is a dangerous blanket statement that is perfect for queuing up genre trivia because of the absolute absurd amounts of musical genres people don’t typically discuss or think about. These are the most criminally underrated music genres that deserve to be commonplace in music discussions . Big Band music, often lumped together with Swing, is a genre of music typically defined by including 10 or more instruments. Building off of jazzy undertones and often lacking vocal contribution, Big Band music erupted in the early 20s- 40s however the genre still lives on and is growing today! Groups such as Snarky Puppy infuse the jazz style of traditional Big Band groups with modern instruments. Big Band is the absolute perfect background music for social events or small parties. 2. Japanese Surf Rock\nGroups like The Beach Boys and Jan and Dean popularized Surf Rock in the mid to late 1960s. In a classic case of, anything you can do, I can do better, Japanese music groups took the Surf Rock genre to the net level. With a sound that can only be described as a surf-rock guitar being unlocked to its full potential, groups such as Takeshi Terauchi And Bunnys revolutionized the possibilities of the Surf-Rock genre. Honestly, I encourage everybody reading this blog to check out some Japanese Surf Rock, you will not regret it! 3. Space Rock\nYeah, you heard me right, Space Rock. I cannot stress enough how much Space Rock needs to make a mainstream resurgence! The objective of Space Rock is to obtain an other-worldly sound, typically this is accomplished by the use of distortions, wild amounts of reverb, and instruments including guitars, synthesizers, and even the occasional thereon. Popularized n the 1960s as space and cosmic intrigue was at an all-time high, these early effects-heavy tracks create almost an eerie feeling of intrigue! My bandmate put it best describing the sound as the music equivalent to playing the hit game Destroy All Humans. 4. Psycedellic Space Rock\nLike Space rock? Well, we’re breaking it down into a subgenre now! Psychedelic Space Rock takes the eerie unearthly feeling of space rock and combines it with the detached mindset of Psychedelic Rock. Emerging in the late 60s to mid-70s, This genre can serve as a much-needed alternative to the Lo-Fi and Classical music many use to kick back, unwind, relax, or study! Now before you anti-country die-hards click away allow me to clarify, WESTERN MUSIC IS NOT THE SAME AS COUNTRY MUSIC! You can consider it a predecessor to Country or even Bluegrass for that matter but Western music is its own entity. Comprised of Spanish guitar and often upright bass, the key to Western music is the storytelling. Possibly the richest in backstory of all the musical genres, Western music goes into great detail describing stories, events, folklore, and tales of tragedy. The absolute best genre in my opinion for long road trips or sitting around a fire, Western music focuses on the story rather than any eccentric musical accompaniments. The unappointed King of the Western Balled, Marty Robbins.\n\nChoosing music to listen to might seem like it is a simply decision to make, but like life, it is far from as easy as it originally might seem. If going on a road trip, choosing the correct genre of music to start out the trip and drive with can be instrumental in setting the mood. Perhaps country music should be chosen to start out the drive. There are some great tunes in country that would fit with a road trip or drive. Immediately, the song Life is a Highway comes to mind. The remake of this song by the Rascal Flatts is a great version of the song, but the original by Tom Cochrane is also a great version. One type of popular music is Gospel music. It is a very popular genre and this type of music is created to demonstrate feelings of spiritual and personal belief towards Christian life. There are different subgenres in this type of music such as contemporary gospel, Southern gospel, and urban contemporary gospel. This genre typically uses choirs and a piano or organ. Gospel can be easily be traced back to the 18th century although one can track roots further back into history. Another strong genre choice is Christian music. Technically any music played in a Christian worship service is Christian music, such as hymns, but Contemporary Christian music has become a popular subgenre of Christian music. It is frequently soft rock but all types and genres of music are there as an option.\n\nQuestion:What genre of music is Nickel Creek known for?",

The pop-folk-rock arrangement of \"Spit On a Stranger,\" from the pen of Pavement's Stephen Malkmus, includes some processed background voices and a snaking electric guitar line. Nickel Creek's originals, mostly written by mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile, are equally inspired. Thile's intriguing meditation on youthful love and commitment, \"Young,\" and his \"Brand New Sidewalk,\" a cautionary ballad addressing the pitfalls of fame (keyed by Sean Watkins's Leo Kottke-like riffs), are as emotionally honest as the musical elements are beautifully realized. Nickel Creek's reach oftentimes threatens to exceed their grasp, which makes the effort even more impressive when it works, as on \"Spit On a Stranger,\" where Thile strains to reach a high note and then nails it. Ultimately, they profit from the experience, emerging with something fresh and vital. This Side is a scintillating exercise in making music with muscle, meaning, and great heart. - Release Date:\n- Smoothie Song\n- Spit on a Stranger\n- Hanging by a Thread\n- Should've Known Better\n- This Side\n- Green and Gray\n- Seven Wonders\n- House Carpenter\n- Beauty and the Mess\n- Sabra Girl\n- Brand New Sidewalk\nPerformance CreditsNickel Creek Primary Artist\nEdgar Meyer Bass,Upright Bass\nByron House Acoustic Bass\nChris Thile Bouzouki,Guitar,Mandolin,Strings,Vocals,Vocal Harmony\nSara Watkins Fiddle,Strings,Vocals,Vocal Harmony\nSean Watkins Guitar,Vocals,Vocal Harmony\nTechnical CreditsAlison Krauss Producer\nNeal Cappellino Engineer\nGary Paczosa Engineer\nJason Lehning Engineer\nChris Thile Arranger\nTerry Hoff Illustrations\nSara Watkins Arranger\nSean Watkins Arranger\nWendy Stamberger Art Direction\nTracy Martinson Engineer\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\nSee all customer reviews\nI enjoyed their last CD, but this one is even better! It has a good mix of sounds, that even makes people that don't like country or blue grass like their CD! Nickel Creek has always been amazing, but this time they've truly done it. I listen to \"This Side\" everyday of my life. If i didn't Id die... They are so amazing and have only become more amazing. Nickel Creek is back, and perhaps we wish they would have figured out their own particular style by now. Maybe they have and there is no word for it yet. This album is a patchwork similar to the album preceding it. Lots of choices, and if you're good with the remote, you can program out the stuff that's really annoying to you. There are some good new sounds here - but the ones that soar are the ones with the harmonies, and there are just too few of these. Perhaps that's the point Nickel Creek is making - we'll do it our way. \"All they get of you is what they get out of the show. The rest is mine I guess the beauty and the mess to hide.\" (Beauty & the Mess, Track 10).",

            "passage": "Bluegrass is one of the most diverse genres in the world of music. Bluegrass has influenced many different styles including rock, country, pop and even hip-hop! This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today’s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop\/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today’s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music.",

            "passage": "If you like the jazzy-grass-folk-fusion instrumental pieces, my suggestions below may be places to continue on your quest. There is a tradition preceding (or paralleling) this aspect of Nickel Creek. Even Chris Thile's own effort, \"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\" (2001) is pretty solid. Buy that one first. I liked Nickel Creek's first effort but 'This Side' blew me away. Every track on this CD is terrific. For anyone who loves acoustic music with outstanding vocals, this is a must hear. Their instrumental tracks are great, but 1 or 2 per album is enough for me. The four tracks on their debut release was a little too much. Great Job Nickel Creek! I LOVED their first CD, and was waiting to get my hands on this CD. At first, I was a little hesitant as I listned to the songs. But, when I listened to it the second time, I fell in love with it. It's different, which is good. I enjoyed the first album but I think this album ventured to far from the roots of bluegrass\nNickel Creek's sophomore album does not disappoint. The songs live up to the band's energetic and lively playing! Kudos to the band for going out on a limb and daring to be adventurous in their song choices and interpretations. The title track stands out as well as their rendition of Carrie Newcomer's \"I Should've Known Better.\" We can only hope they will continue to sing and play for many more years! I was watching public television and saw their set...so young yet their sound is so captivating, I'm amazed at their ability to make such great music. After hearing them on TV, I had to buy the cd! folksie bluegrass diehards who obessed over the perfection of nickel creek's self-titled first release on sugar hill a few years back beware- you may be a bit angry not to find much bluegrass here. however, all the lame comments about nickel creek \"wandering too far from their roots\" are ubsurd and unfounded! the band members are from SoCal people, not your bluegrass capital of the world! however, keep an open mind, go through the album SLOWLY and DEEPLY, and you will be just as impressed as the first go around! Smoothie Song- is the only instrumental but is great, they need a few more ones like this on the album to round it out; Spit on a Stranger- not really my thing, but has attracted some new listeners i'm sure; Speak- gorgeous song, a lot like Sean's solo album (check that out too btw); Hanging By a Thread- Chris's voice is kinda funky here, and kinda makes you hurt; I Should've Known Better- awesome, love this song; This Side- another great example of why Sean should sing a lot more, his writing skills are really amasing! ; Green and Grey- really cool lyrics here... great imagery so i'll give it the best lyrics of the album nod; Seven Wonders- kinda sleepy but sits well with Sara's voice; House Carpenter- long but good for the traditionalist's sake; Beauty and the Mess- Sara steps out of her shell here, it's an awesome song; Sabra Girl- great cover, could stand to be a bit more 'celtic'; Young- nice lyrics, pretty song; Brand New Song- really deep, Chris's growth since the last time is apparent here... on the whole- GIVE IT A CHANCE.. it, just like the last one, will grow on you... as allison krauss said \"it's just nickel creek music\"\nWhat Can I Say That Hasn't Already Been Said About Nickel Creek. Thile Has Developed As One Of The Most Talented Songwriters and Vocalists In Years. Great Vocal Debut By Sean Watkins on ''This Side'' and ''Speak''. Sara Shines As Well. Not What I Expected, But How Could I Expect An Album Of Such Unbridled Talent & Genius. Tracks: 1. Smoothie Song- Not A Sign Of What Is To Come, but a fierce Instrumental None the Less. 2. Spit On A Stranger- Like Nothing You've Heard Before. One of the album's distinctive highlights. 3. Speak-Good Song...Well Done, but not a signature track. 4.",

            "passage": "The last time I listened to Nickel Creek was to analyze their adaptation of Robert Burns’ poem, “Sweet Afton,” in my English literature class in college three years ago. Indeed, the waters of Nickel Creek flow gently, a trait reflected in “Sweet Afton” and many other Nickel Creek staples. And that general lack of bite, paired with an almost robotic mastery of each band members’ respective instrument, pushed me away from the band. So it was strange that, with no expectations and an arbitrarily negative perception of the classic folk band, I really enjoyed seeing Nickel Creek reunite in Washington, D.C. after a six-year hiatus. The show, in sum, was really, really good. I was sandwiched on the upper level between some high schoolers and a middle-aged man at the show with, presumably, his mom. Below us was a melting pot of folk music fans of all ages with one thing in common: they all love Nickel Creek. I didn’t realize so many people could love Nickel Creek so strongly, and I was blown away by the energy and participation of the crowd. The band thrived on the raucous sing alongs of the crowd and seemed to feel like it almost owed them a great performance. Everyone in the building was having a good time. I went to see Punch Brothers last spring at the same venue (the 9:30 Club in D.C.) and was blown away by the musicianship of all of the band’s members but especially its mandolin virtuoso and front man — Chris Thile — who also happens to be a member of Nickel Creek. The Nickel Creek performance followed suit, and each member provided stunning displays of technical mastery combined with emotional energy (usually fueled by the crowd), particularly on the instrumental tunes peppered throughout the set. The band played all of their hits (see their “best of” album, Reasons Why: The Very Best) for what comprised most of their set list. They threw in a few nice new tunes like “Destination” and “Love of Mine” for good measure, but the crowd definitely enjoyed hearing some of the more popular songs like “The Lighthouse’s Tale” and “When in Rome.”\nAll in all, great show from a great band, and who knows how long they’ll be on tour for in the future — fans had to wait six years up until a few months ago. Here’s to hoping there’s still more to come from an already prolific folk band. Brandon Hook is the Web and Multimedia Associtae at Sojourners.",

            "passage": "Nickel Creek: A Dotted Line\n“There are worse ways\/ to start\/ the first day, of the rest of my life,” Chris Thile sings, and A Dotted Line begins. It’s been seven years since Nickel Creek was a touring band, 11 since they won a Grammy under Alison Krauss’ helm, and 25 since they first formed. This isn’t a requisite reunion, but rather the outpouring of a band at their peak. Having garnered cult status because of their talent, Nickel Creek always eluded mainstream success because they didn’t write typical hits, even of the Mumford variety. Thile is a genius on the mandolin, who—combined with Sean Watkin’s country guitar and sister Sara's indie-conscious fiddling—recreates old folk for the 21st century. Fans of “Ode to a Butterfly” will find new favorites in “Elsie” and “Elephants in the Corn” (with Edgar Meyer on bass), but they’ll be most excited by “Hayloft.” The final tune is by the Canadian band Mother Mother, and the Nickel Creek cover retains all the weirdness and unusual arrangements of the original. The group excels at harmonies throughout, though Sara’s voice comes across best on the last track, Sam Phillips’ “Where is Love Now.” Other standouts include the classic “21st of May” and the cursed “Love of Mine,” but there’s not a song on the album that falls short. Each songwriter has circled back from the band's hiatus with a fully realized sound; they recorded A Dotted Line in a mere twelve days. This summer, fans everywhere will be celebrating the return of Nickel Creek.",

            "passage": "Music comes in many different forms and not all of them are equally popular. Maybe you are into a specific type of music and maybe you like 1 or 2 genres more, but the thing is, most people prefer just one genre. This can be useful to new musicians, due to the fact they can start their career in the music genre that is most popular. This would definitely make the things easier. You may believe that POP music is the #1 in the world, but it isn’t. Now you will see the most popular music genres in the world. - Heavy Metal\nOnce treated as outcasts, the musicians of this genre are today the number one when it comes to the music popularity. They have the most fans across the planet, but in the United States, this number is even higher. Heavy Metal started its life back in the 60s, as a sub-genre of rock. Some of the best-known names in this genre are Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fans of this type of music are completely into it and their lifestyle is even based on Heavy Metal. - Rock n’ Roll\nRock n’ Roll has been one of the most popular music genres since the day it was invented. Let’s just say that the first traces of this music come from the 50s, but the popularity was significantly increased during the 70s and 80s. ACDC, G N R and many others have made this genre the ultimate choice for most people. This music is commonly produced by a drummer, a singer, bass player and a guitar player. - Alternative music\nThis music genre has no description, nor it can be described actually, simply because it is based on art. We all know that art cannot be defined. Linkin Park, Evanescence and many others made this music extremely popular and extremely desirable. You will need drummer, vocals and a guitar and you are good to go. This is also the hardest music genre to dominate. - Hard Rock\nThis genre isn’t the same as heavy metal or just rock. It is completely different in a matter of fact and it has a lot to offer. Rush, Led Zeppelin and literally, dozens of other bands made this genre the ultimate one if you want to enjoy the music, but at the same time, you want to listen to the beautiful words, great bass and to dance like you have never before. Classical music is still one of the most popular music genres ever. It is completely different than anything else and it is more than just beneficial to listen. Just relax in one of the best massage chairs, turn on the music and relax. First and foremost, this music is always produced by some of the biggest and the best musicians ever known. Mozart, Beethoven, and literally many others have shaped the classical music according to their beliefs. Now, we can simply enjoy that literally forever. And yes, this music is also known for increasing the IQ. Rap has been the most popular type of music in ghettoes, and in groups where people wanted to express themselves in an interesting and original way. This music may be the only kind that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. Since the time it has been first noticed, till now, it has made a significant improvement. Some of the biggest names here are Eminem, Tupac, Nas, Big L and etc. How many of you listen to the jazz music? Probably all of you have listened to it at least a few times in your life. The reason why is very simple. This is a gentle, sensitive music that is rich in feelings and always makes you think about something or someone. All artists from this genre are very popular and there are high chances this is going to be similar to the classical music in the near future. Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and many others have been responsible for some of the best songs ever. In addition, jazz originated from New Orleans and it has been made by slaves back in a day! - Electronic music\nCommonly known as dance music, or electronic dance music (EDM), is one of those genres that has to be on every list. It has been among us since the 80s, but in the 90s it got very desirable. The place of origin is Europe, but since 2000 electronic music has been introduced in the United States. Nowadays, it is the most common choice for crazy parties and nightclubs where people simply want to relax and dance. Here, words and vocals are not present. On the other side, thebass is something that has an important part. Pop music isn’t the most popular, as you can see, but the highest number of people talk about it every day.",

Let us know what you think down below and who’s cover caught you off guard! Be sure to check out more music related articles here and keep on rockin’ on! I love Music. Possibly the most overstated sentence in the English language, as well as one of the most untrue. Typically followed by “except country” or “except rap” the statement “I love music” then becomes defunct. Now don’t get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their preference however one cannot simply dismiss an entire genre from having any good tunes because “I don’t listen to\/ like that genre.” Likewise, “I love music” is a dangerous blanket statement that is perfect for queuing up genre trivia because of the absolute absurd amounts of musical genres people don’t typically discuss or think about. These are the most criminally underrated music genres that deserve to be commonplace in music discussions . Big Band music, often lumped together with Swing, is a genre of music typically defined by including 10 or more instruments. Building off of jazzy undertones and often lacking vocal contribution, Big Band music erupted in the early 20s- 40s however the genre still lives on and is growing today! Groups such as Snarky Puppy infuse the jazz style of traditional Big Band groups with modern instruments. Big Band is the absolute perfect background music for social events or small parties. 2. Japanese Surf Rock\nGroups like The Beach Boys and Jan and Dean popularized Surf Rock in the mid to late 1960s. In a classic case of, anything you can do, I can do better, Japanese music groups took the Surf Rock genre to the net level. With a sound that can only be described as a surf-rock guitar being unlocked to its full potential, groups such as Takeshi Terauchi And Bunnys revolutionized the possibilities of the Surf-Rock genre. Honestly, I encourage everybody reading this blog to check out some Japanese Surf Rock, you will not regret it! 3. Space Rock\nYeah, you heard me right, Space Rock. I cannot stress enough how much Space Rock needs to make a mainstream resurgence! The objective of Space Rock is to obtain an other-worldly sound, typically this is accomplished by the use of distortions, wild amounts of reverb, and instruments including guitars, synthesizers, and even the occasional thereon. Popularized n the 1960s as space and cosmic intrigue was at an all-time high, these early effects-heavy tracks create almost an eerie feeling of intrigue! My bandmate put it best describing the sound as the music equivalent to playing the hit game Destroy All Humans. 4. Psycedellic Space Rock\nLike Space rock? Well, we’re breaking it down into a subgenre now! Psychedelic Space Rock takes the eerie unearthly feeling of space rock and combines it with the detached mindset of Psychedelic Rock. Emerging in the late 60s to mid-70s, This genre can serve as a much-needed alternative to the Lo-Fi and Classical music many use to kick back, unwind, relax, or study! Now before you anti-country die-hards click away allow me to clarify, WESTERN MUSIC IS NOT THE SAME AS COUNTRY MUSIC! You can consider it a predecessor to Country or even Bluegrass for that matter but Western music is its own entity. Comprised of Spanish guitar and often upright bass, the key to Western music is the storytelling. Possibly the richest in backstory of all the musical genres, Western music goes into great detail describing stories, events, folklore, and tales of tragedy. The absolute best genre in my opinion for long road trips or sitting around a fire, Western music focuses on the story rather than any eccentric musical accompaniments.

If going on a road trip, choosing the correct genre of music to start out the trip and drive with can be instrumental in setting the mood. Perhaps country music should be chosen to start out the drive. There are some great tunes in country that would fit with a road trip or drive. Immediately, the song Life is a Highway comes to mind. The remake of this song by the Rascal Flatts is a great version of the song, but the original by Tom Cochrane is also a great version. One type of popular music is Gospel music. It is a very popular genre and this type of music is created to demonstrate feelings of spiritual and personal belief towards Christian life. There are different subgenres in this type of music such as contemporary gospel, Southern gospel, and urban contemporary gospel. This genre typically uses choirs and a piano or organ. Gospel can be easily be traced back to the 18th century although one can track roots further back into history. Another strong genre choice is Christian music. Technically any music played in a Christian worship service is Christian music, such as hymns, but Contemporary Christian music has become a popular subgenre of Christian music. It is frequently soft rock but all types and genres of music are there as an option.",

In some cases field values are specified as case-specific names. This is standard XML. HTML allows for any case and converts tags and attribute names to lower case before use. The HTML language does not impose specific case requirements on attribute values. XHTML is XML-based, so it is case sensitive; however, all tag and attribute names are defined as lowercase. You are here\nThis page contains a listing of blogs about 3D technologies and artistry. This is the first of a multi-part post that examines the issues preventing easy integration of X3D into DOM. This post lists the specific issues and provides some background. It links to other posts that discuss the issue in more detail and in some cases provide possible solutions. This is part of a multi-part post that explores some ideas for integrating X3D into HTML5 DOM. It explores various options and their implications. The primary post is \"Integrating X3D into DOM - Issues\". HTML gained wide-spread acceptance because it was straight-forward and produced results even if you did write it perfectly - it is very forgiving. Of course, you get better results when written correctly, but you are never puzzling out what\nIEA102A INVALID PARAMETER\/FORMAT - RESPECIFY means1. HTML presents a unified environment to the web designer and user. This post introduces XSeen - a declarative language built on A-Frame and X3D to achieve the desire of a fully declarative 3D\/VR language that runs in the web browser. In this initial release the language supports some X3D and some A-Frame nodes and capabilities. It is possible to combine the two to produce results that are the available in either. I attended my first Silicon Valley VR Expo last week. It was very different than VRLA. As might be expected, this one is more focused on tech; though there were plenty of content discussions. Fortunately, the expo floor was not as loud as VRLA and I had many conversations with vendors. This is the fifth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D and addresses the needs and requirements for X3D for the display of 3D, AR, and VR content in the current ecosystem of display devices and environments. The 3D content is displaying in a larger ecosystem of including the user’s computer, browser, Internet, and originating server. As such it needs to work cooperatively within the environment and with other content already displaying in that environment. This is the fourth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. Archiving and long-term storage has always been a strong point of X3D. The ability to read and play content from years or even decades ago makes it unsurpassed in the 3D world. X3D has human-readable formats that can be used for archiving so that the content does not require special software to unpack and display the file contents. It is important to keep the long-term storage and access capability while along X3D to stay current with advances in display technology. This is the third in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. The current architecture of X3D does not support the industry standards in modeling, archival, and user experience. It uses a single primary file with additional external resources loaded as needed including other X3D files or media (images, audio, video, and scripts). The capabilities made available in the X3D files are either insufficient (e.g., lack of deformable skin animation) or in conflict with the major display environment (e.g., Scripts). This post describes a systems architecture with implications for content architecture that addresses these issues.\n\nCego implements a relational and transactional database system with support for the SQL query language.

Release Notes: This release is more than a year in the making, with millions of DNS queries processed during several months of testing. It brings some significant improvements regarding scalability and flexibility. Resolvers are now pluggable just as ZoneProviders, adding another dimension compared to 1.0, which was a strictly authoritative server. Custom resolvers can now be added, and multiple resolvers can be used simultaneously configured as a chain. MakePAK is a command-line tool for creating Quake .PAK files. It is supposed to be paired with PhysicsFS, which can read Quake .PAK archives. It follows the GNU standards, providing a portable, consistent, and complete utility. Release Notes: This release fixes a major bug where the last byte of the file was excluded (which was especially problematic in binary files). Windows binaries are not currently provided, but may be added soon. Note: currently, the Linux RPMs\/DEBs are outdated. There are problems updating the openSUSE build service. Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses more than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software distribution and data archiving. Lzip is a clean implementation of the LZMA algorithm. The Lzip file format is designed for long-term data archiving. It is clean, provides very safe four factor integrity checking, and is backed by the recovery capabilities of lziprecover. Release Notes: For large values of \"--match-length\", (high compression levels), the compression ratio has been slightly increased, and compression time has been reduced by up to 6%. VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is designed for the visualization and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure.

I attended my first Silicon Valley VR Expo last week. It was very different than VRLA. As might be expected, this one is more focused on tech; though there were plenty of content discussions. Fortunately, the expo floor was not as loud as VRLA and I had many conversations with vendors. This is the fifth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D and addresses the needs and requirements for X3D for the display of 3D, AR, and VR content in the current ecosystem of display devices and environments. The 3D content is displaying in a larger ecosystem of including the user’s computer, browser, Internet, and originating server. As such it needs to work cooperatively within the environment and with other content already displaying in that environment. This is the fourth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. Archiving and long-term storage has always been a strong point of X3D. The ability to read and play content from years or even decades ago makes it unsurpassed in the 3D world. X3D has human-readable formats that can be used for archiving so that the content does not require special software to unpack and display the file contents. It is important to keep the long-term storage and access capability while along X3D to stay current with advances in display technology. This is the third in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. The current architecture of X3D does not support the industry standards in modeling, archival, and user experience. It uses a single primary file with additional external resources loaded as needed including other X3D files or media (images, audio, video, and scripts). The capabilities made available in the X3D files are either insufficient (e.g., lack of deformable skin animation) or in conflict with the major display environment (e.g., Scripts). This post describes a systems architecture with implications for content architecture that addresses these issues.",

    "answer": "Losing a home can have significant negative impacts on your health beyond just the mental stress. Here are several ways in which losing a home can affect your health:\n\n1. **Physical Health Strain:** The stress associated with losing a home can lead to physical health issues such as sleep disturbances, digestive problems, and increased vulnerability to illnesses. Chronic stress can weaken the immune system, making you more susceptible to colds, flu, and infections.\n\n2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Relocation due to losing a home might force you to move to an area with less access to healthy food options or a safe environment for exercise, which could lead to unhealthy eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and related health conditions.\n\n3. **Financial Strain:** Losing a home often results in significant financial stress, which can lead to anxiety and depression. This financial strain might also affect your ability to access healthcare due to cost constraints, leading to neglected medical issues.\n\n4. **Social Isolation:** Moving away from established communities and social networks can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are associated with an increased risk of mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.\n\n5. **Decreased Access to Care:** If you move to an area with fewer healthcare resources, it can be more difficult to get regular medical care, which is crucial for managing chronic conditions and preventing health issues from escalating.\n\n6. **Exposure to New Health Risks:** Depending on where you relocate, you might face new environmental health risks, such as exposure to pollutants, poor air quality, or hazardous waste sites, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.\n\n7. **Increased Risk of Homelessness:** In some cases, losing a home can lead to homelessness, which is associated with a higher risk of physical and mental health problems, including malnutrition, exposure to harsh weather conditions, and violence, which can have lasting effects on your health.\n\n8. **Impact on Children:** If children are involved, the stress of losing a home can affect their emotional and physical well-being, leading to behavioral problems, decreased academic performance, and increased vulnerability to stress-related illnesses.\n\n9. **Loss of Routine:** Losing a home can disrupt daily routines, leading to irregular eating patterns, lack of sleep, and reduced exercise, all of which can contribute to a decline in physical health.\n\n10. **Chronic Stress:** The ongoing stress of dealing with the aftermath of losing a home can have long-term effects on your health, contributing to chronic stress, which is linked to numerous health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders.\n\nIn summary, the impact of losing a home extends beyond the emotional distress and encompasses a broad range of physical, social, and economic factors that can adversely affect your overall health. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach that includes mental health support, access to resources, and efforts to create stable living conditions.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Of course! The results of this study made perfect sense to me - that losing your wealth or savings in late middle-age is such a mental shock (\"negative wealth shock\") that it increases the risk of death for any reason (\"all cause mortality\") tremendously over the next 20 years. About 50% increased risk of death. For example, if you have to live off your savings after you get laid off or can't work due to illness, and perhaps even lose your house to foreclosure, is STRESSFUL beyond belief. Almost incomprehensible to anyone who has not personally gone through it. On top of that, a person may then not be able to afford to go to the doctor, even if there is a problem, once they're financially stressed. And of course they may never financially recover because the \"negative wealth shock\" happened at an older age (the people were 51 to 61 at the start of the study). Other research conducted at time of the Great Recession showed significant associations between negative wealth shocks and short-term health changes - including increased risk of depression, anxiety, suicide, impaired cardiovascular function, and substance abuse. And now we know that long-term there is an increased risk of death. From Science Daily:\nA sudden loss of net worth in middle or older age is associated with a significantly higher risk of death, reports a new Northwestern Medicine and University of Michigan study. When people lose 75 percent or more of their total wealth during a two-year period, they are 50 percent more likely to die in the next 20 years, the study found. \"We found losing your life-savings has a profound effect on person's long-term health,\" said lead author Lindsay Pool, a research assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"It's a very pervasive issue. It wasn't just a few individuals but more than 25 percent of Americans had a wealth shock over the 20 years of the study.\" Though the rate of savings loss spiked during the Great Recession, middle- and older-age Americans consistently lost savings across the 20-year period, regardless of the larger economic climate. \"Our findings offer new evidence for a potentially important social determinant of health that so far has not been recognized: sudden loss of wealth in late middle or older age,\" said senior author Carlos Mendes de Leon, professor of epidemiology and global public health at University of Michigan's School of Public Health. The study also examined a group of low-income people who didn't have any wealth accumulated and who are considered socially vulnerable in terms of their health. Their increased risk of mortality over 20 years was 67 percent. The likely cause of the increased death risk may be twofold. \"These people suffer a mental health toll because of the financial loss as well as pulling back from medical care because they can't afford it,\" Pool said. The new study builds on prior research in the wake of the Great Recession from 2007 to the early 2010s. Those studies examined short-term health effects such as depression, blood pressure and other markers of stress that changed as peoples' financial circumstances took a nosedive. The study was based on data from the Health and Retirement Study from the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Started in 1992, the longitudinal study follows a representative group of U.S. adults 50 years and older every two years. More than 8,000 participants were included in the Northwestern study.\n\nRenters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners\nHomes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and\/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.\n\nStress takes a huge toll on our health\nIt’s almost impossible to exist in today’s world without stress. We all feel it: the pressures of job, home, kids, health, finances. Every day, our personal time shrinks. We consider it an indulgence if we can squeeze in the time to simply sit and enjoy a cup of tea, read a book for the sheer pleasure of it or take a long, leisurely bubble bath. Never before in history have humans had so much to do and so many varieties of ways to do it. We rarely get a chance to catch our breath. And it’s taking a huge toll on our health. Unresolved stress can lead to a downward spiral of depression and anxiety, and cause a wide range of physical problems, from headaches and heart disease to weight gain, gastrointestinal problems and more. The causes of stress\nStress isn’t always bad. It can be a motivator. It’s what gets you out of bed in the morning and sends you to the office or for your semi-annual dental check-up. But when stress takes over your life and when you’re unable to release it, it sets up a toxic cycle that can make you sick. Be aware that even the emotional stress of generally happy life events such as having a baby, getting married, buying a new house or getting a promotion can have the same physiological effects as dealing with the major illness of a close member of your family or losing a job. The stress itself is not the issue. Stress is in our lives whether we like it or not. The real question is this: how do you deal with stress? The cost of stress\nUnresolved stress, the kind of stress you haven’t dealt with and eliminated from your body and mind, is sometimes called chronic or toxic stress. This sustained stress overrides your body’s natural abilities to bounce back. Stress keeps piling upon stress, leaves stress hormones at high levels and suppresses your immune system, making you vulnerable to colds, flu and all kinds of illnesses. In fact, it’s been found that people who are diagnosed with various types of cancer have frequently undergone a recent major life stress, such as the break-up of a marriage, bankruptcy or the death of a close family member. Our responses to stress are ancient and instinctive. When we think we are in danger, our adrenal glands release adrenaline. This increase breathing and heart rates and sends extra blood sugar to the muscles in preparation to fight or flee from the threat. This fight-or-flight response worked just fine when our ancestors were fleeing from saber-toothed tigers. However, that protection mechanism doesn’t serve us very well today, when the threats are far more often mental and emotional. After all, you can’t run away from your sick child or your boss. Toxic stress diminishes your body’s ability to produce cortisol and another adrenal hormone, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), when you need them. You then become even less able to respond in an appropriate way to stressors and to end the stress cycle. Some of the prices you pay for toxic stress in the short term\nThese can include a suppressed immune system, increasing risk of infections, reduced rate of the body’s ability to repair itself, slower metabolism and reduced ability to absorb vital nutrients. You may experience the following symptoms\nAnything from recurring headaches, vague aches and pains, dizziness, heartburn, muscle tension, dry mouth, excessive perspiration, pounding heart, insomnia and fatigue. The long-term price you pay is even heavier\nIncluding acceleration of the aging process, weight gain and increased risk of digestive problems, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, heart disease and even cancer. When your brain runs out of feel-good brain chemicals, you experience the following:\n- Anxiety, fear, restlessness\n- Irritability, anger\n- Loss of sex drive\n- Excessive eating, smoking, drinking or drug use\nThere’s another important mechanism that takes place when you are chronically stressed: your blood sugar levels rise and then abruptly fall. That’s because adrenaline and cortisol dump sugar into your bloodstream, and in an hour or two your blood sugar crashes. This is a serious problem because 20% of your body’s entire intake of glucose fuels your brain, so when your sugars crash, you start feeling foggy, nervous, tired and irritable.\n\nGetting laid off is one of the most stressful life changes a person can endure. In fact, psychologists often list it as a leading cause of stress, right alongside death, divorce and major illnesses. The immediate concern most people have after losing a job is maintaining financial stability. However, maintaining mental and physical health are also crucial to have the strength and sense of well-being to move forward. To keep your health in good shape despite this major blow, incorporate these four tips into your life during the transition period. 1. Make Sure You’re Insure\nWhen you lose your job, your health insurance goes with it, which means no coverage for regular check-ups, no easy access to doctor visits for health concerns and zero financial security in the event of a medical emergency. Although this may be a financially unstable time in your life, it actually makes more economic sense to purchase short-term insurance coverage to prevent incurring a hefty bill in the event of an unexpected emergency. 2. Exercise Regularly\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, exercise and physical activity in general produce endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that naturally eliminate pain, reduce stress and promote a generally positive state of mind. Exercise can also reduce fatigue and improve alertness and concentration, both of which increase your ability to think and function at optimal levels throughout the day. With the current unemployment rate at 7.9 percent, it helps to have a good supply of energy for each and every day of the job hunt. 3. Eat a Balanced Diet\nThere’s a gross misconception among junk-food enthusiasts that maintaining a healthful diet means you have to spend a lot of extra money on top-notch organic products from high-end health food stores. In reality, purchasing fruits and vegetables at your local grocery store is often much cheaper than many people realize. Make sure to consult the food pyramid to ensure your dietary needs are met and talk to your doctor about what kinds of foods you should incorporate into your diet. To save even more money, try shopping at farmer’s markets for the freshest, most nutritious foods at a discounted price. 4. Get Enough Sleep\nThe bright side of unemployment is that you don’t have to wake up extra early to make it to your nine-to-five. Because of this, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be getting plenty of rest during this period. Sleep refreshes your mind and body, which makes you more productive during waking hours. If stress is making it difficult to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, try practicing a relaxing bedtime routine each night, such as taking a warm bath, drinking a cup of tea, reading and participating in other activities to reduce stress and keep your mind at ease. Coping with the stress of a recent job termination is certainly not an easy task, but it’s one that many people face in the course of their lives. These tips will help you maintain the mental and physical health necessary to come out of this struggle as a stronger person. Even though this period will be challenging, make sure to take the time to treat yourself right and good things will follow.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a massive increase in mental health issues across all genders, age groups and cultures. This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.\n\nCleaning for Mental Health\nOctober 30, 2018\nEveryone does their best to keep up on household chores and cleaning, but clutter always finds a way to seep back in. It’s as if messes pop up out of nowhere sometimes, no matter how often clean. If you staring down another Saturday’s worth of cleaning in the Stamford apartments, then there is some good news you might find surprising. Leading psychological research as attributed clutter to stress and anxiety, but recent studies discovered that cleaning up messes actually has a positive benefit on your mental health. That’s right. If you want to destress, then pick up a cleaning rag and a duster. Here’s the science behind why cleaning is good for your health. The University of California gathered thirty couples for a study on stress hormones. Those who described their house as messy or chaotic displayed increased levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland in response to stress. The same study also found that women were more adversely affected by clutter than men. So, a messy home has a negative impact on your health. It only makes sense that decreasing the clutter would alleviate your buildup of cortisol, therefore being a healthy habit. However, there’s more to it than just that. The Mental Benefits\nAside from improving cleanliness, cleaning does have a positive impact on your mental health. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine proved that a mere twenty minutes of physical activity was enough to decrease stress levels, but a Scottish Health Survey proved that activity didn’t have to be a workout. Over 3,000 people surveyed reported that regular housework was enough to decrease anxiety and stress levels, with further research placing that decrease at around 20%. While cleaning isn’t a cure all, that percentage can work wonders on your daily level of stress. Did you know that anxiety and stress are linked to a shorter lifespan? A 2015 study in the U.K. found that a stressful work environment can take up to 33 years off your life. Most people have stressful jobs, but adding on the stress of a cluttered home could be even more detrimental. If you can clean for just twenty minutes a day, you can reduce the impact that stress has on your life. It gets even better, though. Vigorous cleaning (like washing the floors) is an outlet for negative emotions thanks to the energy your burn while scrubbing away. Individuals also reported having an easier time unwinding at the end of the day when their home was cleaned. Altogether, that means doing household chores after a rough day at the office is the perfect remedy. The Physical Benefits\nAnother study conducted by Indiana University’s Physical Activity Department looked at the impact a clean home had on both physical and mental health. Their findings on mental health coincided with the benefits found by previous studies, but they did find one interesting correlation between a cluttered home and an individual’s activity level. As it turn out, people with the cleanest homes are the most active. While the correlation is unclear, there’s something about clutter that causes people to lose motivation, choosing to sit down in front of the TV instead of go for a walk or hit the gym. Another benefit to a clean home is a lack of allergens waiting to attack your immune system. The longer you go without cleaning your home (really cleaning, not just dusting) the more polluted the air inside your home becomes. Compared to right outside your front door, your home’s air quality is often five times worse on any given day. That means more pollen, dust mites, dander, and other allergens hiding in plain sight. Regular cleaning your home is an excellent way to relieve stress, stay active, and feel your best by removing the pesky elements lingering in the air. Keeping up with such a rigorous cleaning schedule isn’t exactly easy, though. However, there are a few steps you can take to make this chore less taxing. De-Clutter for Good\nThe first step to de-cluttering your home is to cut back on the number of things you purchase. If you take a moment to think about it, how many items in your home are simply collecting dust? How many items do you own and never use? If you have a free weekend, then you might want to consider taking the time to sort through all of your belongings and sell or donate the items you don’t need. Closets are an excellent place to start, as are cupboards and any form of storage space.\n\nWhether it be a health crisis, job loss, death of a loved one, break up or other difficulty, we all must face and confront losses.

Research has continually shown that stress, as experienced over prolonged periods, is detrimental to our health. Chronic stress is linked with many adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure and heart attacks. Chronic stress can even negatively impact our mental health, possibly leading to the development of depression or anxiety. Yet, high-stress levels can also contribute to another issue that can affect every part of your life, from your safety to your job—mistakes. When you’re feeling stressed, your decision-making abilities aren’t at their usual best, and so mistakes about. You’re likely to make bad decisions, according to Harvard researchers. They studied students who were experiencing high-stress levels and found these students to be worse at making good long-term choices. In this way, stress can have long-lasting effects that go beyond your health to affect your life as well. Sleep is vital for your body to repair the wear and tear your body experiences throughout the day. It’s also crucial for performing at your best, which is long-term stress, and its impact on sleep is so harmful. Stress degrades the quality of sleep you get, which means you won’t be on the top of your game the next morning. As stress interferes with your sleep, you’ll find that you might feel duller and have trouble making the connections when thinking you usually could. Lack of sleep due to stress can cause mistakes in judgment, such as when to make the left turn across traffic lanes, making it a major health risk. Chronic stress can also be seen as a tendency to view all things from a black and white perspective grows. When you’re stressed, your brain is more likely to over-simplify things to provide some peace rather than complexity to analyze. However, this black and white thinking just perpetuates your stress, as few things are without complication. Thinking along a binary in this manner can lead to significant mistakes because of over-simplifying a problem and not considering all aspects. This mistake is one that can affect your job, as being able to think complexly is a valuable trait in any employee. Watching out for these stress-induced mistakes can help you ensure your stress levels aren’t getting out of hand. Be sure to take some self-care time to lower your stress and risk of making major mistakes.\n\nWhen you don’t find that equal balance between work life and home life, it can cause stress, anxiety, and even relationship and job issues. What kind of problems will you experience? Let’s take a look. When you live the life of a workaholic, it can affect your mental and physical health. You might notice minor things, like a few nights of insomnia or some irritability, but other harmful things are happening to your body when you’re not taking time for yourself. Stress is both a physical and a mental aspect of not having a work-life balance. It is that stress that may push you toward other physical health issues. Stress causes:\n- A compromised immune system: When your immune system isn’t running correctly you become more susceptible to illnesses, including the common cold. When you get sick, it can make it even more challenging to fulfill work and home duties. - Insomnia: Stress makes it difficult to sleep since it keeps you worrying about all of the things you need to do or the things you haven’t been doing. - An increased risk of heart disease: Stress is strainful on your heart, which increases your risk of stroke and heart attack. Aside from stress, having an unbalanced work-life situation can be draining. It may make you tired, keep you from doing things you like to do, and it may even make you feel older than you are. Too little time for work may cause more hardship when you’re unable to afford doctor visits or other bills as well. The added stress also affects you mentally. Stress may lead to anxiety and irritability. Other psychological effects of an imbalance between work and life include mood swings and depression. Depression may make it hard to live your life, though some people thrive on working their lives away (or they think they do anyway). It can still take a toll on you. You have no time for friends and family, which can lead to depression and feelings of isolation. Working and not taking care of yourself or taking days off can lead to job burnout too. When work consumes your life, burnout is inevitable. Signs of burnout include:\n- High blood pressure\n- And all of the other things already discussed here. Burnout happens when you take on too much at work, work more than you relax, when you’re taking on other people’s jobs, and even when you feel like you have no control in the workplace. The flip side of all this can also cause problems. Some people put too little focus on their work life and would rather have fun. You may be living it up now, but at some point, it’s going to hit you that you’ve thrown away things that could have been good for you, like a raise or your job in general. Losing your job because of a lack of dedication may leave you unemployed for a while, which adds to your stress while you fight to pay bills and keep a roof over your head. Some of the mental and physical effects of an imbalance in work and life may cause problems in relationships, from work relationships to romantic ones. Not only that, but you may not spend as much time with the people that matter in your life, which can push them away and make them feel unwanted or unimportant. Resentment form family members can happen when you don’t put enough focus on career and when you put too much emphasis on your job. That’s why you need to create that equal balance. Your spouse or significant other is with you for a reason; they want to spend time with you. Don’t overlook them when you’re busy chasing your career dreams. Children may feel unwanted by a parent that spends more time working than they do at home, but they also need you to be working and earning money so they can have the things they need, like clothing and an education. Your family isn’t the only group of people in your life affected when you are imbalanced. Your friends may feel like they see too much of you if you’re always slacking off, or they may feel like they never see you if you’re always working and never have time to get together. Not everyone is more focused on career than life. If you enjoy your life too much and spend less time focusing on work, it may lead to work problems. When work isn’t a priority for you the work you do may show it, so you could be creating inferior products or selling less because you just don’t care. If you experience burnout from working too much, you can become short-tempered with your work peers and even your boss. Both of these scenarios may lead to disciplinary action, cut hours, and even job loss.\n\nIs it really difficult to lose belly fat? Usually, exercise alone doesn’t work. Dieting rarely works long term. You never achieve your goal or the result doesn’t last. Along the way you’ve endured starvation, cravings and hair loss instead of losing belly fat. Sounds familiar? You find yourself wasting time and money, the result is not forthcoming, you are more stressed and depressed than before. You start eating to comfort yourself, as it’s a fast non-functional ‘cure’ for depression and anxiety. It’s a vicious circle, right? You are confused, sick and tired…\nAnd the belly fat is the worst part! It’s not just making you hate how you look. It’s dangerous for your health too, because abdominal fat is associated with the development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart disease, and cancer! The good news is we can do something to prevent these diseases. You can lose belly fat naturally at home. Dr Shawn Talbott in his book ‘The Cortisol Connection’ explains what stress does to us, how chronic stress leads to more belly fat and why it’s dangerous for our health. He explains how to lose belly fat as well.\n\nQuestion:Why is losing a home bad for your health beyond just mental stress?",

            "passage": "Of course! The results of this study made perfect sense to me - that losing your wealth or savings in late middle-age is such a mental shock (\"negative wealth shock\") that it increases the risk of death for any reason (\"all cause mortality\") tremendously over the next 20 years. About 50% increased risk of death. For example, if you have to live off your savings after you get laid off or can't work due to illness, and perhaps even lose your house to foreclosure, is STRESSFUL beyond belief. Almost incomprehensible to anyone who has not personally gone through it. On top of that, a person may then not be able to afford to go to the doctor, even if there is a problem, once they're financially stressed. And of course they may never financially recover because the \"negative wealth shock\" happened at an older age (the people were 51 to 61 at the start of the study). Other research conducted at time of the Great Recession showed significant associations between negative wealth shocks and short-term health changes - including increased risk of depression, anxiety, suicide, impaired cardiovascular function, and substance abuse. And now we know that long-term there is an increased risk of death. From Science Daily:\nA sudden loss of net worth in middle or older age is associated with a significantly higher risk of death, reports a new Northwestern Medicine and University of Michigan study. When people lose 75 percent or more of their total wealth during a two-year period, they are 50 percent more likely to die in the next 20 years, the study found. \"We found losing your life-savings has a profound effect on person's long-term health,\" said lead author Lindsay Pool, a research assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"It's a very pervasive issue. It wasn't just a few individuals but more than 25 percent of Americans had a wealth shock over the 20 years of the study.\" Though the rate of savings loss spiked during the Great Recession, middle- and older-age Americans consistently lost savings across the 20-year period, regardless of the larger economic climate. \"Our findings offer new evidence for a potentially important social determinant of health that so far has not been recognized: sudden loss of wealth in late middle or older age,\" said senior author Carlos Mendes de Leon, professor of epidemiology and global public health at University of Michigan's School of Public Health. The study also examined a group of low-income people who didn't have any wealth accumulated and who are considered socially vulnerable in terms of their health. Their increased risk of mortality over 20 years was 67 percent. The likely cause of the increased death risk may be twofold. \"These people suffer a mental health toll because of the financial loss as well as pulling back from medical care because they can't afford it,\" Pool said. The new study builds on prior research in the wake of the Great Recession from 2007 to the early 2010s. Those studies examined short-term health effects such as depression, blood pressure and other markers of stress that changed as peoples' financial circumstances took a nosedive. The study was based on data from the Health and Retirement Study from the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Started in 1992, the longitudinal study follows a representative group of U.S. adults 50 years and older every two years. More than 8,000 participants were included in the Northwestern study.",

            "passage": "Renters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners\nHomes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and\/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.",

            "passage": "Stress takes a huge toll on our health\nIt’s almost impossible to exist in today’s world without stress. We all feel it: the pressures of job, home, kids, health, finances. Every day, our personal time shrinks. We consider it an indulgence if we can squeeze in the time to simply sit and enjoy a cup of tea, read a book for the sheer pleasure of it or take a long, leisurely bubble bath. Never before in history have humans had so much to do and so many varieties of ways to do it. We rarely get a chance to catch our breath. And it’s taking a huge toll on our health. Unresolved stress can lead to a downward spiral of depression and anxiety, and cause a wide range of physical problems, from headaches and heart disease to weight gain, gastrointestinal problems and more. The causes of stress\nStress isn’t always bad. It can be a motivator. It’s what gets you out of bed in the morning and sends you to the office or for your semi-annual dental check-up. But when stress takes over your life and when you’re unable to release it, it sets up a toxic cycle that can make you sick. Be aware that even the emotional stress of generally happy life events such as having a baby, getting married, buying a new house or getting a promotion can have the same physiological effects as dealing with the major illness of a close member of your family or losing a job. The stress itself is not the issue. Stress is in our lives whether we like it or not. The real question is this: how do you deal with stress? The cost of stress\nUnresolved stress, the kind of stress you haven’t dealt with and eliminated from your body and mind, is sometimes called chronic or toxic stress. This sustained stress overrides your body’s natural abilities to bounce back. Stress keeps piling upon stress, leaves stress hormones at high levels and suppresses your immune system, making you vulnerable to colds, flu and all kinds of illnesses. In fact, it’s been found that people who are diagnosed with various types of cancer have frequently undergone a recent major life stress, such as the break-up of a marriage, bankruptcy or the death of a close family member. Our responses to stress are ancient and instinctive. When we think we are in danger, our adrenal glands release adrenaline. This increase breathing and heart rates and sends extra blood sugar to the muscles in preparation to fight or flee from the threat. This fight-or-flight response worked just fine when our ancestors were fleeing from saber-toothed tigers. However, that protection mechanism doesn’t serve us very well today, when the threats are far more often mental and emotional. After all, you can’t run away from your sick child or your boss. Toxic stress diminishes your body’s ability to produce cortisol and another adrenal hormone, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), when you need them. You then become even less able to respond in an appropriate way to stressors and to end the stress cycle. Some of the prices you pay for toxic stress in the short term\nThese can include a suppressed immune system, increasing risk of infections, reduced rate of the body’s ability to repair itself, slower metabolism and reduced ability to absorb vital nutrients. You may experience the following symptoms\nAnything from recurring headaches, vague aches and pains, dizziness, heartburn, muscle tension, dry mouth, excessive perspiration, pounding heart, insomnia and fatigue. The long-term price you pay is even heavier\nIncluding acceleration of the aging process, weight gain and increased risk of digestive problems, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, heart disease and even cancer. When your brain runs out of feel-good brain chemicals, you experience the following:\n- Anxiety, fear, restlessness\n- Irritability, anger\n- Loss of sex drive\n- Excessive eating, smoking, drinking or drug use\nThere’s another important mechanism that takes place when you are chronically stressed: your blood sugar levels rise and then abruptly fall. That’s because adrenaline and cortisol dump sugar into your bloodstream, and in an hour or two your blood sugar crashes. This is a serious problem because 20% of your body’s entire intake of glucose fuels your brain, so when your sugars crash, you start feeling foggy, nervous, tired and irritable.",

            "passage": "Getting laid off is one of the most stressful life changes a person can endure. In fact, psychologists often list it as a leading cause of stress, right alongside death, divorce and major illnesses. The immediate concern most people have after losing a job is maintaining financial stability. However, maintaining mental and physical health are also crucial to have the strength and sense of well-being to move forward. To keep your health in good shape despite this major blow, incorporate these four tips into your life during the transition period. 1. Make Sure You’re Insure\nWhen you lose your job, your health insurance goes with it, which means no coverage for regular check-ups, no easy access to doctor visits for health concerns and zero financial security in the event of a medical emergency. Although this may be a financially unstable time in your life, it actually makes more economic sense to purchase short-term insurance coverage to prevent incurring a hefty bill in the event of an unexpected emergency. 2. Exercise Regularly\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, exercise and physical activity in general produce endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that naturally eliminate pain, reduce stress and promote a generally positive state of mind. Exercise can also reduce fatigue and improve alertness and concentration, both of which increase your ability to think and function at optimal levels throughout the day. With the current unemployment rate at 7.9 percent, it helps to have a good supply of energy for each and every day of the job hunt. 3. Eat a Balanced Diet\nThere’s a gross misconception among junk-food enthusiasts that maintaining a healthful diet means you have to spend a lot of extra money on top-notch organic products from high-end health food stores. In reality, purchasing fruits and vegetables at your local grocery store is often much cheaper than many people realize. Make sure to consult the food pyramid to ensure your dietary needs are met and talk to your doctor about what kinds of foods you should incorporate into your diet. To save even more money, try shopping at farmer’s markets for the freshest, most nutritious foods at a discounted price. 4. Get Enough Sleep\nThe bright side of unemployment is that you don’t have to wake up extra early to make it to your nine-to-five. Because of this, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be getting plenty of rest during this period. Sleep refreshes your mind and body, which makes you more productive during waking hours. If stress is making it difficult to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, try practicing a relaxing bedtime routine each night, such as taking a warm bath, drinking a cup of tea, reading and participating in other activities to reduce stress and keep your mind at ease. Coping with the stress of a recent job termination is certainly not an easy task, but it’s one that many people face in the course of their lives. These tips will help you maintain the mental and physical health necessary to come out of this struggle as a stronger person. Even though this period will be challenging, make sure to take the time to treat yourself right and good things will follow.",

            "passage": "In recent years, there has been a massive increase in mental health issues across all genders, age groups and cultures. This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.",

            "passage": "Cleaning for Mental Health\nOctober 30, 2018\nEveryone does their best to keep up on household chores and cleaning, but clutter always finds a way to seep back in. It’s as if messes pop up out of nowhere sometimes, no matter how often clean. If you staring down another Saturday’s worth of cleaning in the Stamford apartments, then there is some good news you might find surprising. Leading psychological research as attributed clutter to stress and anxiety, but recent studies discovered that cleaning up messes actually has a positive benefit on your mental health. That’s right. If you want to destress, then pick up a cleaning rag and a duster. Here’s the science behind why cleaning is good for your health. The University of California gathered thirty couples for a study on stress hormones. Those who described their house as messy or chaotic displayed increased levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland in response to stress. The same study also found that women were more adversely affected by clutter than men. So, a messy home has a negative impact on your health. It only makes sense that decreasing the clutter would alleviate your buildup of cortisol, therefore being a healthy habit. However, there’s more to it than just that. The Mental Benefits\nAside from improving cleanliness, cleaning does have a positive impact on your mental health. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine proved that a mere twenty minutes of physical activity was enough to decrease stress levels, but a Scottish Health Survey proved that activity didn’t have to be a workout. Over 3,000 people surveyed reported that regular housework was enough to decrease anxiety and stress levels, with further research placing that decrease at around 20%. While cleaning isn’t a cure all, that percentage can work wonders on your daily level of stress. Did you know that anxiety and stress are linked to a shorter lifespan? A 2015 study in the U.K. found that a stressful work environment can take up to 33 years off your life. Most people have stressful jobs, but adding on the stress of a cluttered home could be even more detrimental. If you can clean for just twenty minutes a day, you can reduce the impact that stress has on your life. It gets even better, though. Vigorous cleaning (like washing the floors) is an outlet for negative emotions thanks to the energy your burn while scrubbing away. Individuals also reported having an easier time unwinding at the end of the day when their home was cleaned. Altogether, that means doing household chores after a rough day at the office is the perfect remedy. The Physical Benefits\nAnother study conducted by Indiana University’s Physical Activity Department looked at the impact a clean home had on both physical and mental health. Their findings on mental health coincided with the benefits found by previous studies, but they did find one interesting correlation between a cluttered home and an individual’s activity level. As it turn out, people with the cleanest homes are the most active. While the correlation is unclear, there’s something about clutter that causes people to lose motivation, choosing to sit down in front of the TV instead of go for a walk or hit the gym. Another benefit to a clean home is a lack of allergens waiting to attack your immune system. The longer you go without cleaning your home (really cleaning, not just dusting) the more polluted the air inside your home becomes. Compared to right outside your front door, your home’s air quality is often five times worse on any given day. That means more pollen, dust mites, dander, and other allergens hiding in plain sight. Regular cleaning your home is an excellent way to relieve stress, stay active, and feel your best by removing the pesky elements lingering in the air. Keeping up with such a rigorous cleaning schedule isn’t exactly easy, though. However, there are a few steps you can take to make this chore less taxing. De-Clutter for Good\nThe first step to de-cluttering your home is to cut back on the number of things you purchase. If you take a moment to think about it, how many items in your home are simply collecting dust? How many items do you own and never use? If you have a free weekend, then you might want to consider taking the time to sort through all of your belongings and sell or donate the items you don’t need. Closets are an excellent place to start, as are cupboards and any form of storage space.",

Research has continually shown that stress, as experienced over prolonged periods, is detrimental to our health. Chronic stress is linked with many adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure and heart attacks. Chronic stress can even negatively impact our mental health, possibly leading to the development of depression or anxiety. Yet, high-stress levels can also contribute to another issue that can affect every part of your life, from your safety to your job—mistakes. When you’re feeling stressed, your decision-making abilities aren’t at their usual best, and so mistakes about. You’re likely to make bad decisions, according to Harvard researchers. They studied students who were experiencing high-stress levels and found these students to be worse at making good long-term choices. In this way, stress can have long-lasting effects that go beyond your health to affect your life as well. Sleep is vital for your body to repair the wear and tear your body experiences throughout the day. It’s also crucial for performing at your best, which is long-term stress, and its impact on sleep is so harmful. Stress degrades the quality of sleep you get, which means you won’t be on the top of your game the next morning. As stress interferes with your sleep, you’ll find that you might feel duller and have trouble making the connections when thinking you usually could. Lack of sleep due to stress can cause mistakes in judgment, such as when to make the left turn across traffic lanes, making it a major health risk. Chronic stress can also be seen as a tendency to view all things from a black and white perspective grows. When you’re stressed, your brain is more likely to over-simplify things to provide some peace rather than complexity to analyze. However, this black and white thinking just perpetuates your stress, as few things are without complication. Thinking along a binary in this manner can lead to significant mistakes because of over-simplifying a problem and not considering all aspects. This mistake is one that can affect your job, as being able to think complexly is a valuable trait in any employee. Watching out for these stress-induced mistakes can help you ensure your stress levels aren’t getting out of hand. Be sure to take some self-care time to lower your stress and risk of making major mistakes.",

What kind of problems will you experience? Let’s take a look. When you live the life of a workaholic, it can affect your mental and physical health. You might notice minor things, like a few nights of insomnia or some irritability, but other harmful things are happening to your body when you’re not taking time for yourself. Stress is both a physical and a mental aspect of not having a work-life balance. It is that stress that may push you toward other physical health issues. Stress causes:\n- A compromised immune system: When your immune system isn’t running correctly you become more susceptible to illnesses, including the common cold. When you get sick, it can make it even more challenging to fulfill work and home duties. - Insomnia: Stress makes it difficult to sleep since it keeps you worrying about all of the things you need to do or the things you haven’t been doing. - An increased risk of heart disease: Stress is strainful on your heart, which increases your risk of stroke and heart attack. Aside from stress, having an unbalanced work-life situation can be draining. It may make you tired, keep you from doing things you like to do, and it may even make you feel older than you are. Too little time for work may cause more hardship when you’re unable to afford doctor visits or other bills as well. The added stress also affects you mentally. Stress may lead to anxiety and irritability. Other psychological effects of an imbalance between work and life include mood swings and depression. Depression may make it hard to live your life, though some people thrive on working their lives away (or they think they do anyway). It can still take a toll on you. You have no time for friends and family, which can lead to depression and feelings of isolation. Working and not taking care of yourself or taking days off can lead to job burnout too. When work consumes your life, burnout is inevitable. Signs of burnout include:\n- High blood pressure\n- And all of the other things already discussed here. Burnout happens when you take on too much at work, work more than you relax, when you’re taking on other people’s jobs, and even when you feel like you have no control in the workplace. The flip side of all this can also cause problems. Some people put too little focus on their work life and would rather have fun. You may be living it up now, but at some point, it’s going to hit you that you’ve thrown away things that could have been good for you, like a raise or your job in general. Losing your job because of a lack of dedication may leave you unemployed for a while, which adds to your stress while you fight to pay bills and keep a roof over your head. Some of the mental and physical effects of an imbalance in work and life may cause problems in relationships, from work relationships to romantic ones. Not only that, but you may not spend as much time with the people that matter in your life, which can push them away and make them feel unwanted or unimportant. Resentment form family members can happen when you don’t put enough focus on career and when you put too much emphasis on your job. That’s why you need to create that equal balance. Your spouse or significant other is with you for a reason; they want to spend time with you. Don’t overlook them when you’re busy chasing your career dreams. Children may feel unwanted by a parent that spends more time working than they do at home, but they also need you to be working and earning money so they can have the things they need, like clothing and an education. Your family isn’t the only group of people in your life affected when you are imbalanced. Your friends may feel like they see too much of you if you’re always slacking off, or they may feel like they never see you if you’re always working and never have time to get together. Not everyone is more focused on career than life. If you enjoy your life too much and spend less time focusing on work, it may lead to work problems. When work isn’t a priority for you the work you do may show it, so you could be creating inferior products or selling less because you just don’t care. If you experience burnout from working too much, you can become short-tempered with your work peers and even your boss. Both of these scenarios may lead to disciplinary action, cut hours, and even job loss.",

    "answer": "Working with other specialists during a child's assessment can provide a comprehensive understanding of the child's needs and challenges. Different specialists bring their unique expertise and perspectives, which can lead to a more holistic evaluation.\n\nFor example, a psychologist might evaluate the child's cognitive and emotional functioning, while a speech-language pathologist could assess communication skills. An occupational therapist might look at fine motor skills and sensory processing, and a pediatrician can provide medical insight.\n\nThis collaborative approach ensures that all aspects of the child's development are considered, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and a more effective treatment plan. By consulting with various specialists, parents and caregivers can also receive a range of recommendations and strategies tailored to the child's specific needs. Additionally, working with a multidisciplinary team can prevent \"tunnel vision,\" where one specialist might overlook important information that another specialist could identify. Overall, involving multiple specialists in the assessment process helps to create a more complete picture of the child's abilities and challenges, facilitating better support and intervention strategies.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.\n\nIf the teachers (or coaches or you) see that your child has friends, pays attention in class, follows routines, stays with tasks fairly well, and otherwise manages that day, then a focused evaluation of the core issue by a learning specialist, reading specialist, language specialist or occupational therapist (for writing) will likely suffice. - If there are concerns in more than one area or if a more focused evaluation (and intervention) has not helped your child make progress, then a more comprehensive developmental evaluation maybe needed. This would be an evaluation that carefully reviews the history and assesses your child in multiple areas. This would include a cognitive profile, an academic profile, assessment of attention control, language skills, memory, and problem solving, as well as screening of emotional style and sensory motor processing. This should provide enough information to understand your child’s needs, make a diagnosis if warranted, and lay out a course of action. There is one clear benefit of an evaluation independent of the school district. A private evaluation can make recommendations for both private and school-based treatments. A school district cannot recommend educational or developmental resources outside of the district without being held financially responsible for them. A private evaluator can help parents explore a wider range of resources (even if they are not free). How do you find a good evaluator? Within the school district, you do not have much choice. Your child will be evaluated by the team of specialists (learning specialist, psychologist, occupational therapist, speech\/language specialist) assigned to the school. However, you do have some choices. If your child has unique needs (e.g., non-verbal or English is not their first language or history of head injury), you can ask for a specialist within the district (there often is one) to participate in the evaluation. If there is no specialist in the district, you can ask that the district pay for someone who has the expertise to evaluate your child. Outside of the school district, the sky is the limit. It’s very intimidating. There are a lot of specialists out there and they are all proud of their work. Quite frankly, child psychologists are your most likely source for comprehensive testing, but even so, not all of us specialize in evaluations. Here are a few strategies to narrow down your options:\n- Talk to your pediatrician. They often have a list of people that their patients have had good experiences with. - Call the local medical school or university to inquire if there is a child development clinic and what types of assessments are done. - Call the local learning disability association (or check their website) and see if they have a list of preferred evaluators for children with needs like your child’s. - Look for private child development clinics (I practice in one) that can provide both comprehensive and domain specific evaluations. - You can check with tutoring centers, but the evaluation there is typically geared to laying out a plan of treatment within that program. While the program may be helpful, the evaluation is likely not a diagnostic evaluation. In addition, the evaluator within that program may not have a broad range of experiences (she may only know that program). Here are a few questions to ask when considering an evaluator:\n- MOST IMPORTANT-Describe your child and then ask, “Do you have experience with children similar to mine?”\n- “Will you be able to make a formal diagnosis if needed?”\n- “What are the costs of the evaluation? Will that include a written report?”\n- “Do you take insurance?” “Does insurance cover this type of evaluation?”\n- “What if I have additional questions after the evaluation is concluded? And find an experienced, but humble, evaluator because:\n“Not everything that can be measured is important, and not everything that is important can be measured” ~a quote coughed up by the internet, attributed to Albert Einstein, and based on something said by William Bruce Cameron (but it really fit here)\nEvaluation is my life! There is so much more information than can be included in a simple blog post. I would love to hear what questions you have and how I can help. We also included a lot more information in our book, Child Decoded. Check it out for in-depth information about evaluations, as well as a wealth of information on learning, behavioral or attention challenges (and their treatments).\n\nHow a Child Life Specialist Can Help You\nHow a Child Life Specialist Can Help Your Child and Family\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics affirms that child life is “an essential component of quality pediatric health care,”1 and as such, child life services have become a standard in most pediatric hospital settings. Child life specialists typically work as members of an interdisciplinary team, which may include physicians, nurses, social workers, therapists, counselors, teachers, parents and others. Child life specialists focus on the psychosocial needs of children, collaborating with parents and other members of the team to:\n- Ease a child’s fear and anxiety with therapeutic and recreational play activities\n- Foster an environment that incorporates emotional support\n- Encourage understanding and cooperation by providing non-medical preparation and support for children undergoing tests, surgeries, and other medical procedures\n- Advocate for family-centered care\n- Engage and energize children and families by coordinating special events, entertainment, and activities\n- Consider the needs of siblings or other children who may also be affected by a child’s illness or trauma\n- Direct pre-admission hospital tours and resources, and consultations with outpatient families\n- Support families confronting grief and bereavement issues\n- Provide information and resources for parents and members of the interdisciplinary team\n- Collaborate with members of the interdisciplinary team, including doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, social workers, and other representatives from pediatric disciplines\n- Supervise and train child life students and volunteers\n- Coordinate donations and seek sources for program funding\n- Educate the public-at-large on the needs of children\nHow Can I Obtain Child Life Services for My Child? If you are interested in obtaining child life services for your child and family, ask your physician or an organization administrator if child life services are appropriate and\/or available. For more information on the child life profession, please download a copy of the Child Life Services Flyer .\n\nYou have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation.\n\nTreatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.\n\n#042 How can a Neuropsychologist help my gifted child? With Dr Marnie Cumner\nWhat is a neuropsychologist and how can they help my gifted child? We talk to Dr Marnie Cumner about neuropsychology and dive into how a neuropsychologist undertakes a holistic assessment of a child. In this episode, she talks about her strengths-based model of understanding both strengths and challenges and the whole child. These niche psychologists approach assessment differently and it is great to learn more about this process and how they might help a family looking for answers. We’re hugely grateful for Dr Marnie Cumner for taking the time to introduce neuropsychologists! Hit play and let’s get started! “I think what’s useful with doing an assessment of the child’s strengths and challenges is what you said there about the building the bridges of that connection and understanding and empathy for parents because often parents are feeling really frustrated by certain behaviours or by certain little idiosyncrasies. And it’s so powerful to be able to say. Actually, this is not mischief or maliciousness or being naughty, or they need to pull up their socks. It’s none of that. There’s a genuine difficulty with XYZ and that’s why this is coming out in this behaviour. And I can see that parents sometimes just need to have that context to go ah, right, okay. And a few parents have said to me in the past that they feel like they can be empathetic with their child’s experience in that moment, knowing that they’re not just doing it, they actually are really overwhelmed and struggling with whatever that might be.” – Dr Marnie Cumner\n- Nav Neuro – a podcast that dives into what neuropsychology is all about\n- Dr Marnie Cumner‘s Sunshine Coast Office\n- Australian Psychological Society resources on a variety of topics\nDr Marnie Cumner is a Clinical Neuropsychologist on The Sunshine Coast, with specialised training in understanding how brain function affects our everyday thinking and behaviour. Paediatric Neuropsychology is a professional speciality, which focuses on understanding how the development of a child’s brain relates to their cognitive (thinking), behavioural, social and emotional functioning. Marnie provides assessment services for children and adolescents to better understand their individual strengths and difficulties. She investigates thinking skills, such as, memory, attention, language and problem-solving, as well as social-emotional functioning, academic performance and behaviour. Marnie uses the child’s individual profile of strengths and difficulties to provide tailored recommendations for improved learning, behaviour and emotion regulation. She uses a strengths-based model, which focuses on using a child’s strengths to minimise their difficulties.

Wheels of Wellness provides formal assessment and evaluation of behavior across environments. Evaluation results can be shared via a behavioral evaluation report. We are also able to provide assessments as part of a multi-disciplinary team via consultation with other treatment providers. Assessments can include:\n- Collecting and analyzing data to look at the interrelatedness of antecedent components of the behavior, the consequences of the behavior and the behavioral function. - Identifying the behavior’s reinforcing factors\n- Determining appropriate recommendations and services necessary for intervention. Do you feel that you need help identifying a consistent means of discipline in your home? Wheels of Wellness provides mobile behavioral support and consultation to parents, caregivers and educators. We come to the environment in which the behaviors are occurring and work to provide the following:\n- Collaborative development and implementation of a systematic behavioral intervention plan appropriate for the environment. - Direct modeling, coaching and monitoring of strategies and interventions. - Consultation and collaboration with other treatment team members. “We are parents of 3 special needs and very high maintenance children (severe ADHD, Anxiety, Tourette Syndrome, stuttering, oppositional behavior…). Our home and school situation had gotten to the point of nearly tearing our family apart until Heather came into the picture. She created a detailed, specific, step-by-step plan that taught us how to effectively manage and discipline our children. We follow the plan and it works – 100% of the time. Heather – quite literally – saved our family. She is brilliant at assessing and advising on behavioral matters, and also on working with schools to get accommodations made for special needs children. Heather consistently goes the extra mile for us and truly cares about her clients. Her expertise, creativity, dedication, follow through and direct manner will work any family in need of help. We have referred Heather to numerous families who have had the same amazing experience as we have had.”\n“Ms. Torres is one of the most professional people I have ever met. My son was having a difficult time at his new school. He was not listening to directions, running out of the classroom and breaking school property. Ms. Torres was able to provide the school with recommendations to best support him. My son has made huge strides and is now doing really well at his school. Without Ms. Torres support and knowledge this story wouldn’t have had a happy ending.”-Parents of a boy in 2nd grade diagnosed with ADHD and Sensory Processing Disorder\n\n- ADHD Symptoms in Children Slideshow Pictures\n- Take the ADHD Quiz\n- Parenting a Child with ADHD Slideshow\n- Find a local Psychiatrist in your town\n- Childhood ADHD facts\n- What are the signs and symptoms of childhood ADHD? - What should parents do if they suspect their child has ADHD? - What are the causes of childhood ADHD? - What should parents of children with ADHD expect from their child? - What type of medical specialist can help diagnose and treat a child with ADHD? - What treatment options exist for a child with ADHD?

Quick GuideADHD in Children: Better Parenting\nWhat should parents of children with ADHD expect from their child? Children experiencing ADHD should be held to the same expectations as their peers of the same emotional developmental level. Assuming the child has no learning disturbance, children with ADHD will have both academic strengths and weaknesses like all non-ADHD classmates. Athletic ability will vary in a similar manner as will social interaction; some children with ADHD are very outgoing while others are more reserved. Children with ADHD are often noted to be emotionally delayed, with some individuals having a delay in maturity of up to 30% when compared with their peers. Thus, a 10-year-old student may behave like a 7-year-old; a 20-year-old young adult may respond more like a 14-year-old teenager. What type of medical specialist can help diagnose and treat a child with ADHD? The initial evaluation of a child whose behavioral issues may be indicative of ADHD can generally by managed by the pediatrician. A current physical examination is indicated to rule out potential medical issues that may either reinforce a potential ADHD diagnosis or rule out the condition. Further history regarding the various behavioral and academic strengths and weaknesses of the child are elicited and it is imperative to gather feedback from both the parents and teacher. If any concerns are developed regarding potential learning disorders (for examples, dyslexia, auditory processing disorders, etc. ), specialized testing should be obtained. This evaluation may be secured either through the child's school district or private agencies. Standardized questionnaires (such as Connors Rating Scales) are often used to provide objective evaluations in both the home and school settings. In addition, these scales commonly have sections to evaluate for other mental-health issues (including depression, anxiety, etc.) that may also be present in a child with ADHD. Once a diagnosis is established, a pediatrician can discuss with the patient and the parents the various treatment options. Children whose physical or mental-health history is more complicated may warrant an evaluation by either a pediatrician with specialty training in developmental disorders, a pediatric neurologist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist. Should a patient have a poor response or excessive side effects to commonly used medications, a pediatric neurologist or psychiatrist consultation may be especially helpful. What treatment options exist for a child with ADHD? How can parents help their child with ADHD? The two major components of treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are behavioral therapy and medication. - Home and school interventions: Parents can help their child's behavior with specific goals such as (1) maintaining a daily schedule, (2) keeping distractions to a minimum, (3) setting reasonable goals, (4) rewarding positive behavior, (5) using charts and checklists to keep a child \"on task,\" and (6) finding activities in which the child will succeed (sports, hobbies). Children with ADHD may require adjustments in the structure of their educational experience, including tutorial assistance and the use of a resource room. Many children function well throughout the entire school day with their peers. However, some patients with ADHD will benefit from a \"pull-out session\" to complete tasks, review specific homework assignments, and develop \"management\" skills necessary for higher education. Extended time for class work\/tests may be necessary as well as assignments written on the board and preferential seating near the teacher. An IEP (Individualized Educational Program) should be developed and reviewed periodically with the parents. ADHD is considered a disability falling under U.S. Public Law 101-476 (Individuals With Disabilities Education Act or IDEA).\n\nWhilst we work in a number of different ways with children, adolescents and adults we promise to always be respectful, creative and find a way that works for you. Children and adolescents\nWe know that growing up can be hard sometimes. It can be helpful to talk to someone outside of your family if something is getting in the way of you enjoying life to the full. You might have been experiencing difficulties such as:\n- Low self-esteem\n- Low mood or feeling unhappy\n- Getting worried, panicky or anxious\n- Having problems in your family\n- Living with a health condition\n- Having to do something in a certain way or a certain number of times to make it feel okay\nIt would be helpful for one of us to initially meet with you to understand the difficulties you are facing. We would explore how it affects you at home, at school, with your friends and think about how they can best help you. It would also be helpful to meet one of your parents or guardians, and you could bring a friend if that would help you feel more comfortable. Together we would decide if it is best to work with you individually or if working with you and your parent\/guardian would be better. It is possible for one of our Psychologists to meet individually with a young person as well as meeting individually with a parent; this can often be a helpful way to work. We understand that life can be challenging in a variety of different ways. Sometimes people need space to be heard and supported to understand and work through the difficulties they face. We hope that through this work, using a variety of models tailored to fit your needs, we can support you to maximise your strengths and resilience. We can work therapeutically with a range of difficulties including:\n- Low mood\n- Low self-esteem\n- Work stress\n- Health problems\n- Relationship issues\n- Overcoming traumatic events\n- Grief and loss\nWe would meet with you to get an understanding of the difficulties and to assess your current situation. Based on this information we would think together about what therapeutic approach may be best suited to you. We would also be happy to meet with members of your family or a partner if that would be helpful. We understand that having a child can change your life and throw up challenges along the way that make it hard to feel like a “good enough parent”. We recognise that you are an expert about your child and your family situation. We invite you to bring that knowledge, together with our expertise in evidence-based strategies that have been shown to help parents and their children. In doing so we hope to create a winning team that helps you to move towards your goals. We acknowledge that there is not one “right” answer but we can work together to find strategies that fit you, your child and your family situation. We can work with a variety of difficulties including:\n- Challenging behaviour and tantrums\n- Sleeping and\/or eating difficulties\n- Relationship and communication difficulties\n- Understanding and supporting children with learning or physical disabilities\nWe are experienced at working alongside and supervising other professionals. We understand that working in the helping professions can be stressful in itself and would be happy to meet with mental health professionals from a therapeutic perspective. We are able to offer:\n- Supervision to mental health professionals or other clinical psychologists\n- Therapies for trainee mental health workers\n- Teaching, training and workshops\n- Team building, managing changing circumstances, and building resilience for individuals, teams or groups.\n\nQuestion:How can working with other specialists help when assessing a child?",

You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

            "passage": "For that reason, they often make an oppositional youngster uncomfortable. The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.",

            "passage": "If the teachers (or coaches or you) see that your child has friends, pays attention in class, follows routines, stays with tasks fairly well, and otherwise manages that day, then a focused evaluation of the core issue by a learning specialist, reading specialist, language specialist or occupational therapist (for writing) will likely suffice. - If there are concerns in more than one area or if a more focused evaluation (and intervention) has not helped your child make progress, then a more comprehensive developmental evaluation maybe needed. This would be an evaluation that carefully reviews the history and assesses your child in multiple areas. This would include a cognitive profile, an academic profile, assessment of attention control, language skills, memory, and problem solving, as well as screening of emotional style and sensory motor processing. This should provide enough information to understand your child’s needs, make a diagnosis if warranted, and lay out a course of action. There is one clear benefit of an evaluation independent of the school district. A private evaluation can make recommendations for both private and school-based treatments. A school district cannot recommend educational or developmental resources outside of the district without being held financially responsible for them. A private evaluator can help parents explore a wider range of resources (even if they are not free). How do you find a good evaluator? Within the school district, you do not have much choice. Your child will be evaluated by the team of specialists (learning specialist, psychologist, occupational therapist, speech\/language specialist) assigned to the school. However, you do have some choices. If your child has unique needs (e.g., non-verbal or English is not their first language or history of head injury), you can ask for a specialist within the district (there often is one) to participate in the evaluation. If there is no specialist in the district, you can ask that the district pay for someone who has the expertise to evaluate your child. Outside of the school district, the sky is the limit. It’s very intimidating. There are a lot of specialists out there and they are all proud of their work. Quite frankly, child psychologists are your most likely source for comprehensive testing, but even so, not all of us specialize in evaluations. Here are a few strategies to narrow down your options:\n- Talk to your pediatrician. They often have a list of people that their patients have had good experiences with. - Call the local medical school or university to inquire if there is a child development clinic and what types of assessments are done. - Call the local learning disability association (or check their website) and see if they have a list of preferred evaluators for children with needs like your child’s. - Look for private child development clinics (I practice in one) that can provide both comprehensive and domain specific evaluations. - You can check with tutoring centers, but the evaluation there is typically geared to laying out a plan of treatment within that program. While the program may be helpful, the evaluation is likely not a diagnostic evaluation. In addition, the evaluator within that program may not have a broad range of experiences (she may only know that program). Here are a few questions to ask when considering an evaluator:\n- MOST IMPORTANT-Describe your child and then ask, “Do you have experience with children similar to mine?”\n- “Will you be able to make a formal diagnosis if needed?”\n- “What are the costs of the evaluation? Will that include a written report?”\n- “Do you take insurance?” “Does insurance cover this type of evaluation?”\n- “What if I have additional questions after the evaluation is concluded? And find an experienced, but humble, evaluator because:\n“Not everything that can be measured is important, and not everything that is important can be measured” ~a quote coughed up by the internet, attributed to Albert Einstein, and based on something said by William Bruce Cameron (but it really fit here)\nEvaluation is my life!

Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation.",

Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.",

We talk to Dr Marnie Cumner about neuropsychology and dive into how a neuropsychologist undertakes a holistic assessment of a child. In this episode, she talks about her strengths-based model of understanding both strengths and challenges and the whole child. These niche psychologists approach assessment differently and it is great to learn more about this process and how they might help a family looking for answers. We’re hugely grateful for Dr Marnie Cumner for taking the time to introduce neuropsychologists! Hit play and let’s get started! “I think what’s useful with doing an assessment of the child’s strengths and challenges is what you said there about the building the bridges of that connection and understanding and empathy for parents because often parents are feeling really frustrated by certain behaviours or by certain little idiosyncrasies. And it’s so powerful to be able to say. Actually, this is not mischief or maliciousness or being naughty, or they need to pull up their socks. It’s none of that. There’s a genuine difficulty with XYZ and that’s why this is coming out in this behaviour. And I can see that parents sometimes just need to have that context to go ah, right, okay. And a few parents have said to me in the past that they feel like they can be empathetic with their child’s experience in that moment, knowing that they’re not just doing it, they actually are really overwhelmed and struggling with whatever that might be.” – Dr Marnie Cumner\n- Nav Neuro – a podcast that dives into what neuropsychology is all about\n- Dr Marnie Cumner‘s Sunshine Coast Office\n- Australian Psychological Society resources on a variety of topics\nDr Marnie Cumner is a Clinical Neuropsychologist on The Sunshine Coast, with specialised training in understanding how brain function affects our everyday thinking and behaviour. Paediatric Neuropsychology is a professional speciality, which focuses on understanding how the development of a child’s brain relates to their cognitive (thinking), behavioural, social and emotional functioning. Marnie provides assessment services for children and adolescents to better understand their individual strengths and difficulties. She investigates thinking skills, such as, memory, attention, language and problem-solving, as well as social-emotional functioning, academic performance and behaviour. Marnie uses the child’s individual profile of strengths and difficulties to provide tailored recommendations for improved learning, behaviour and emotion regulation. She uses a strengths-based model, which focuses on using a child’s strengths to minimise their difficulties.

Quick GuideADHD in Children: Better Parenting\nWhat should parents of children with ADHD expect from their child? Children experiencing ADHD should be held to the same expectations as their peers of the same emotional developmental level. Assuming the child has no learning disturbance, children with ADHD will have both academic strengths and weaknesses like all non-ADHD classmates. Athletic ability will vary in a similar manner as will social interaction; some children with ADHD are very outgoing while others are more reserved. Children with ADHD are often noted to be emotionally delayed, with some individuals having a delay in maturity of up to 30% when compared with their peers. Thus, a 10-year-old student may behave like a 7-year-old; a 20-year-old young adult may respond more like a 14-year-old teenager. What type of medical specialist can help diagnose and treat a child with ADHD? The initial evaluation of a child whose behavioral issues may be indicative of ADHD can generally by managed by the pediatrician. A current physical examination is indicated to rule out potential medical issues that may either reinforce a potential ADHD diagnosis or rule out the condition. Further history regarding the various behavioral and academic strengths and weaknesses of the child are elicited and it is imperative to gather feedback from both the parents and teacher. If any concerns are developed regarding potential learning disorders (for examples, dyslexia, auditory processing disorders, etc. ), specialized testing should be obtained. This evaluation may be secured either through the child's school district or private agencies. Standardized questionnaires (such as Connors Rating Scales) are often used to provide objective evaluations in both the home and school settings. In addition, these scales commonly have sections to evaluate for other mental-health issues (including depression, anxiety, etc.) that may also be present in a child with ADHD. Once a diagnosis is established, a pediatrician can discuss with the patient and the parents the various treatment options. Children whose physical or mental-health history is more complicated may warrant an evaluation by either a pediatrician with specialty training in developmental disorders, a pediatric neurologist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist. Should a patient have a poor response or excessive side effects to commonly used medications, a pediatric neurologist or psychiatrist consultation may be especially helpful. What treatment options exist for a child with ADHD? How can parents help their child with ADHD? The two major components of treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are behavioral therapy and medication. - Home and school interventions: Parents can help their child's behavior with specific goals such as (1) maintaining a daily schedule, (2) keeping distractions to a minimum, (3) setting reasonable goals, (4) rewarding positive behavior, (5) using charts and checklists to keep a child \"on task,\" and (6) finding activities in which the child will succeed (sports, hobbies). Children with ADHD may require adjustments in the structure of their educational experience, including tutorial assistance and the use of a resource room. Many children function well throughout the entire school day with their peers. However, some patients with ADHD will benefit from a \"pull-out session\" to complete tasks, review specific homework assignments, and develop \"management\" skills necessary for higher education. Extended time for class work\/tests may be necessary as well as assignments written on the board and preferential seating near the teacher. An IEP (Individualized Educational Program) should be developed and reviewed periodically with the parents. ADHD is considered a disability falling under U.S. Public Law 101-476 (Individuals With Disabilities Education Act or IDEA).",

With a special mention to Dave Roberts of the Kings who hit a 13 dart leg. The Commrade B team paid a worthwhile visit to the Cross Keys p\/side as they came away with a hard fought 5-4 win, with a specil mention to Gary Roberts who hit a 10 dart leg. The Pen y Bryn B took a stroll down to the Virginnia but came away with all 3 points, with Carl Roberts hitting an 11 dart leg, whilst their sister team the Pen y Bryn A played host to the Cross Keys Llandudno, but the Cross Keys where too strong and came away with a 6-3 a scoreline and all 3 points. Llandudno Cricket club also continued their previous form from last year and had an emphatic win over the LLandudno Athletic lads. 25th September 2018\nWe start this particular weeks games with the “Round Board Fixtures”. We still only have 3 result cards for that particular week, and although we are aware of the scores and who played who, it must be pointed out that only teams that have ensured the result cards have reached us by the Friday of that week, will be included in any write up. We are not going to go looking through photos’s, basically if you can’t be bothered neither can we! So onto the games themselves, a very hard fought match between the Cross Keys Llandudno and the Cricket Club. The Cricket club initially took a 4-2 lead in the singles with wins for Jack Thornton, Paul Thornton, Chris Hornickel and Malcom Sprague, with wins for the Cross Keys by Gaz Evans (Nice to see him back) and Mike Jones. But the Cross Keys took the next two doubles to level the match, but the Cricket club kept their cool and took the last doubles to claim all three points. It was nice to see the return of the Labour club and impressive peformance they gave as they beat Mikey Nigs Williams and Kings Team 5-4. The Pen Y Bryn B visited an under strength Town House and came away 6-3 winners. Mike Castro and his Nevill darts team had their first game of the season, but it was against the Maelgwyn A. But this Nevill team team, which has been strengthened since last season gave a good account of themselves, with wins in the singles for Dave Chapman, Carlos Martins and Jason Atkinson who had an 18 darts leg. But this Maelwgyn team are going to be a force to be reckoned with this season as they recorded single wins for Jim Dorenbos, Pete Lewis (17 dart legg), Phil Smith and last years player league winner Pete Sim-Mutch. But the doubles saw the Maelgwyn power their way taking all three games and with it the win and 3 points. The Penrhyn arms continues their winnign form as they played host to the Pen Golf B lads, but it was a close run thing with the Arms taking a 6-4 win with the very last doubles. Dave Nolan and his RAOB team played host to the Conwy Comrades A lads, but the conwy lads where in no mood to show any favours or grace as they took a commanding 6-1 lead in the singles, with Bryn Hughes hitting two 17 dart legs and Dan Wilson also hitting a 17 dart leg. The Comrades compounded the score by taking the next two doubles and winning the match 8-2. The Pen Golf A lads played host to the Old Hall and cemented and improved on their previous weeks performance and claimed the match with a 6-4 win, with 180’s for Wayne of the Old Hall and Paul Eccles of the Golf Club. The RAOB A travelled to the Alex in Pen, but with many of their strike players back it was evedient as they took the match 9-1 with Carl Elston hitting a 180 and Swin checking out a 117. 2nd October 2018\nAfter beating the Pen Golf B the previous week, the Penrhyn had hopes of inflicting the same result on their sitster team, but Pen Golf A lads had other ideas, with wins for Keith Williams, Paul Eccles, Rob Benjamin, Ian Jones and Iwan Williams saw them take a commanding 5-2 lead in the singles with Sam Bradely and Rob Sumbland replying for the Arms. The Golf club took another game in the doubles to secure the win and record the arms first defeat of the season.\n\nHorse and Groom A hauled themselves off the foot of the top flight in Spalding anfd District Ladies’ League. A second successive win for Samantha Sillett’s side saw them leapfrog fellow Holbeach side United Services Club A. The latest victory came at Lincoln Arms. Julie Fines and Linda Middleton wins had Horse and Groom 4-2 ahead after the singles games. Then Sillett and Glynnis Bannock really turned the screw with a straight-legs win over Mandy Czura and Julie Martin. Sillett also featured in the final doubles game to wrap up a 13-5 win. In Division Two, Debbie O’Rourke had a nice 88 checkout for Drayman’s Arms, who saw off Bell A 12-6. Pinchbeck and District League: Lincoln Arms A fought well to earn a draw against Riverside B in a match which produced 27 scores of 100 or more. Lincoln’s Karl Rolfe had an 18-dart leg and 116 checkout followed by team-mate with Tim Halifax with a 100 checkout. Riverside won the last game of a closely-fought match to make it 4-4, Graham Parker shining through as 2-0 winner against Mike Kearns. Elsewhere, Dan Vaughan checked out on 103 as Lamb and Flag A triumphed 6-2 against Queen. Team-mate Mark Waters weighed in with two 180s. Best checkout of the week went to Lincoln Arms C’s John Charloton who wrapped up a 2-0 defeat of Brennans’ Steve Mosedale with a 139 finish. But that was one of only two games which Brennans lost. Good individual scores in Division B came from Five Bells’ Nigel Dobney and Gill Smith (both 180), Ship A’s Andy Marriott (177 and Lamb and Flag B’s Dan Batchelor (115). In Division C, Drayman’s Arms B won 6-2 at Services thanks partly to Keith Amess’s neat 115 checkout. Aron Moyses Spalding Town League: Leaders Fenway A owe much of their success to their stinginess. They have dropped just 6 games in eight matches.Keith Carter grabbed one of the games for Lincoln Arms A, beating Matt Manning. Fenway’s Paul Edgley needed just 15 throws in the second leg of his 2-0 win over Mick Atkin. He went 100, 100, 140, 81 before finishing on 80.\n\nPLESSEY SEMICONDUCTOR P&D LEAGUE\nIN DIVISION One Riley's A have retained the title with a 5-1 win over club rivals Riley's E.\nRiley's B look set to finish runners-up after winning 6-0 at Barbican Accountants (Adam Lewin 27).

Steve Davis and his players’ executed their game-plan perfectly to record a superb 2-0 win at an in-form Preston North End, who had started the afternoon in 5th place. Crewe certainly had to work hard to contain the likes of Kevin Davis and Iain Hume but that determination to keep that ball out of our net was evident to see with a real battling performance. A first clean-sheet of the season in the League was deserved and a big bonus. The work ethic was superb and the quality finishes of Moore and Inman proved to be the difference on the day. Both sides also hit the woodwork with Hume hitting the woodwork in the opening two minutes and Dugdale doing the same in the second half when Crewe were on top in the game and 2-0 ahead. Crewe Alexandra made two changes from the side that exited the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy against Fleetwood Town on Tuesday evening. Chuks Aneke and Brad Inman reclaimed their starting places ahead of young strikers Max Clayton and Vadaine Oliver. Aneke was the fulcrum of the attack with Inman and Byron Moore in support in a flexible 4-3-3 system. It was the home side immediately on the front foot at Deepdale with Iain Hume creating the first chance of the afternoon after just two minutes. The forward found the supportive full-back Scott Laird in space and his low drive had to be tipped around the post superbly by Steve Phillips. From the resultant corner from the right, a brief scramble inside the six-yard box then saw Hume curl a great effort that struck the Crewe crossbar. Setting up reasonably compact, Crewe were trying to pass the ball into the feet of Aneke and Moore whenever possible and both were unlucky not to make inroads into the Preston last third. Preston were dominating the possession but after that early flurry, Crewe were defending their penalty area with much more assurance. Preston did have a sight of the Crewe goal after 20 minutes but Phillips did well again to deny Stuart Beavon after he had escaped the offside trap. His follow up effort struck the side netting but wouldn’t have counted anyway after Kevin Davies had strayed offside to keep the ball alive. On 25 minutes Crewe took a surprise lead with our first genuine chance of the game. Mark Ellis sent an accurate free-kick up field and after Aneke and Inman had linked up well on the edge of the Preston box, Inman flicked the ball over for Moore. The ball did bounce invitingly for him but after collecting it with a deft touch, he dispatched it into the bottom corner of Declan Rudd’s net. It was Moore’s first goal of the season and only our second goal on our travels in League One. Preston tried to hit back immediately, but Grant blocked a shot from Beavon and Crewe had to survive a dangerous free-kick on the edge of the penalty area but Joel Byrom drilled his effort into a collection of legs and Hume did likewise in the follow up. Turton, who had scored our other away goal at Oldham, then tried his luck from 30 yards but a sliding Rudd had this particular effort covered. Aneke also had a shot blocked from the edge of the box after he was able to get the ball out from his feet. With three minutes of the first half left, the former England forward Davies had a sight of Phillips’ goal but he couldn’t direct his header on target to trouble the Crewe goalkeeper. Trailing to that well taken Moore goal, Preston were always going to try and re-appear on the front foot and after forcing an early corner, but defender Bailey Wright couldn’t direct his header on target to give Phillips something to consider. Ellis also had to head clear from Davies at the far post after Tootle was rather harshly penalised for handball when cutting a cross out from Chris Humphrey. It was a bit uncertain what Tootle could have done about it to get out of the way. Byrom wasn’t booked for a calculated trip on Byron Moore as he raced into a promising two on two situation with Inman in support, but the inconsistent referee did book Turton seconds later for a pull on Hume. Both offences deserved a caution.\n\nScores: Alan May, Sue Dobson, Dave Buckton and Fred Knotts (Skip) won 25-12: Val Hooker, Brian Barnes, Maureen Mulligan and Ray Stephens (Skip) lost 23-19; Kate Nixon, Diane Leach, Chris Jelf and Gwilym Morgan (Skip) won 28-9; Jackie Clapton, Dug Holden, Karen Slogrove and Stuart Hooker (Skip) lost 19-14; Lesley Swift, Glyn Dobson, Jan Derkatsch and Tony Nixon (Skip) won 25-9.

But the Cross Keys took the next two doubles to level the match, but the Cricket club kept their cool and took the last doubles to claim all three points.

But this Maelwgyn team are going to be a force to be reckoned with this season as they recorded single wins for Jim Dorenbos, Pete Lewis (17 dart legg), Phil Smith and last years player league winner Pete Sim-Mutch. But the doubles saw the Maelgwyn power their way taking all three games and with it the win and 3 points.

            "passage": "Outstanding goals from Moore and Inman seal three great points\nTwo superbly taken goals from Byron Moore in the first half and Brad Inman in the second half gave Crewe Alexandra a first league win since August. Steve Davis and his players’ executed their game-plan perfectly to record a superb 2-0 win at an in-form Preston North End, who had started the afternoon in 5th place. Crewe certainly had to work hard to contain the likes of Kevin Davis and Iain Hume but that determination to keep that ball out of our net was evident to see with a real battling performance. A first clean-sheet of the season in the League was deserved and a big bonus. The work ethic was superb and the quality finishes of Moore and Inman proved to be the difference on the day. Both sides also hit the woodwork with Hume hitting the woodwork in the opening two minutes and Dugdale doing the same in the second half when Crewe were on top in the game and 2-0 ahead. Crewe Alexandra made two changes from the side that exited the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy against Fleetwood Town on Tuesday evening. Chuks Aneke and Brad Inman reclaimed their starting places ahead of young strikers Max Clayton and Vadaine Oliver. Aneke was the fulcrum of the attack with Inman and Byron Moore in support in a flexible 4-3-3 system. It was the home side immediately on the front foot at Deepdale with Iain Hume creating the first chance of the afternoon after just two minutes. The forward found the supportive full-back Scott Laird in space and his low drive had to be tipped around the post superbly by Steve Phillips. From the resultant corner from the right, a brief scramble inside the six-yard box then saw Hume curl a great effort that struck the Crewe crossbar. Setting up reasonably compact, Crewe were trying to pass the ball into the feet of Aneke and Moore whenever possible and both were unlucky not to make inroads into the Preston last third. Preston were dominating the possession but after that early flurry, Crewe were defending their penalty area with much more assurance. Preston did have a sight of the Crewe goal after 20 minutes but Phillips did well again to deny Stuart Beavon after he had escaped the offside trap. His follow up effort struck the side netting but wouldn’t have counted anyway after Kevin Davies had strayed offside to keep the ball alive. On 25 minutes Crewe took a surprise lead with our first genuine chance of the game. Mark Ellis sent an accurate free-kick up field and after Aneke and Inman had linked up well on the edge of the Preston box, Inman flicked the ball over for Moore. The ball did bounce invitingly for him but after collecting it with a deft touch, he dispatched it into the bottom corner of Declan Rudd’s net. It was Moore’s first goal of the season and only our second goal on our travels in League One. Preston tried to hit back immediately, but Grant blocked a shot from Beavon and Crewe had to survive a dangerous free-kick on the edge of the penalty area but Joel Byrom drilled his effort into a collection of legs and Hume did likewise in the follow up. Turton, who had scored our other away goal at Oldham, then tried his luck from 30 yards but a sliding Rudd had this particular effort covered. Aneke also had a shot blocked from the edge of the box after he was able to get the ball out from his feet. With three minutes of the first half left, the former England forward Davies had a sight of Phillips’ goal but he couldn’t direct his header on target to trouble the Crewe goalkeeper. Trailing to that well taken Moore goal, Preston were always going to try and re-appear on the front foot and after forcing an early corner, but defender Bailey Wright couldn’t direct his header on target to give Phillips something to consider. Ellis also had to head clear from Davies at the far post after Tootle was rather harshly penalised for handball when cutting a cross out from Chris Humphrey. It was a bit uncertain what Tootle could have done about it to get out of the way. Byrom wasn’t booked for a calculated trip on Byron Moore as he raced into a promising two on two situation with Inman in support, but the inconsistent referee did book Turton seconds later for a pull on Hume.

The tone for a heated game was set in the opening moments when Crown Paints’ captain Matt Allen was awarded a yellow card. Budd’s Michael Clark went close on 14 minutes when he won the ball on the edge of box but saw Crown keeper Tom Scott push the ball over. Scott made another comfortable save on the half-hour following a free-kick on the edge of the box before Allen was sent off for another challenge with half-time five minutes away. The only goal of the game came after 55 minutes when Seear found space at the back post to calmly slot the ball past goalkeeper Scott. Crown Paint missed an opportunity to level through Ant Lynch, and although Budd saw Marco Cobb send a late free-kick over the woodwork, they had done enough to secure victory. Garstang have taken advantage of Blackpool Wren Rovers’ double postponement to leapfrog their title rivals and go top of the West Lancashire Football League Premier Division. Ric Coar netted a brace as Garstang recorded a comfortable 4-0 home win against Whitehaven to take them top of the table by just one point. Ryan Dodd and Kieran O’Connor also found the back of the net. Wren Rovers slipped down to second after their trip to Longridge Town was called off on Saturday. A second attempt to stage the fixture last night was thwarted by a waterlogged pitch. Title rivals Garstang and Wrens both have five games still to play. Elsewhere, Thornton Cleveleys cruelly lost 3-2 away at Tempest United after conceding a last-minute goal. Goals from Shaun Rothwell and Nathan Monson handed Tempest an early two-goal lead but Thornton hit back immediately through Alex Stubbs. Carl Purdon then levelled for the visitors, with all four goals coming before the 30-minute mark. But there was a twist in the tale as Monson grabbed his second in the final minute with a dramatic late penalty that sealed the win for Tempest.

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.\n\nFrom 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character.

Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.\n\nWhen did Homer write the Iliad? Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds.

Homer (\/ˈhoʊmər\/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros; c. 800– c. 701 BC) was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature.\n\nLittle is known about the Ancient Greek oral poet Homer, the supposed 8th century BC author of the world-read \"Iliad\" and his later masterpiece, \"The Odyssey\". These classic epics provided the basis for Greek education and culture throughout the classical age and formed the backbone of humane education through the birth of the Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity. If Homer did in fact exist, this supposedly blind poet was from some region of Greek-controlled Asia-Minor and recited his poems at festivals and political assemblies.

Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's. Fagles's efforts are accompanied by a long and penetrating introduction by Bernard Knox, coupled with detailed glossary and textual notes.-- T.L. Cooksey, Armstrong State Coll., Savannah, Ga.

            "passage": "\"The Wife of Bath\", from Chaucer, and two translations from the \"Odyssey\"—the \"Arrival of Ulysses at Ithaca\" and the \"Garden of Alcinous\"—came out in 1714 in a volume of miscellanies edited by Steele for Tonson, the publisher. \"The Temple of Fame\", in which Steele said there were a thousand beauties, was separately published in the following year, 1715. In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.",

            "passage": "From 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

            "passage": "Eventually THE ILIAD reaches a length of 24 nights, or 24 “books” each taking about an hour to recite, that being an agreeable length of time for an after dinner entertainment. At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.",

Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been.

Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.",

            "passage": "When did Homer write the Iliad? Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds. What is Homer short for? Acronym. Definition. HOMER. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\nWhat is Homer’s full name? Homer (\/ˈhoʊmər\/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros; c. 800– c. 701 BC) was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature.",

Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's.

But in exercising the sensors of those test probes, we made the remarkable discovery that there is water in the Cumberland! At first, we were sure that it had to be a faulty reading or a broken instrument, but seven different tests on multiple instruments confirmed the finding!”\nNASA scientists revealed that their findings indicate that the Cumberland River’s elemental make-up contains a staggering 14% water content. The rest, they say, is a mix of spilled beer from Dancin’ In the District concerts in the 1990s, misplaced Red Bulls from various marathons and 5Ks, discarded flyers from your neighbor’s set at Tin Roof, an as-yet-unclassified semi-gaseous element which they are currently calling “Nashvillium”, and the tears of frustrated Titan’s fans. The science team claim they have been withholding their findings for several years until now, so as not to tip off the public that seeking water was an objective of their search on Mars.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5\/cubic foot construction cost). What can I Do For Nashville's Urban Canopy? · Help Nashville get more roots in the ground! The Cumberland River Compact, Nashville Tree Foundation, and many other environmental non-profits in Nashville offer free trees from September – April each year. · Keep an eye out for Emerald Ash Borer and alert a Metro Tree Advisory member if you spot it! This tiny terror is responsible for wiping out Ash trees all over North America and is expected to cost Tennessee billions. Contact Root Nashville\nfor more information! OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS\nFor each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90\/year per tree includes:\n- Regular watering\n- Pruning of suckers and shoots\n- Data collection & reporting\nSee if you qualify for\nThe Compact’s Tree Water Maintenance Program! Email Heather Listermann\nwith the following info:\nNumber of Trees\nTree Age (Approx)\nTREE CARE TIPS\nHOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO WATER MY TREE? Young trees need approximately one inch of water per week. During dry times it is important to water your tree at least once a week, sometimes even twice. Always water the tree slowly so the water has time to soak into the soil.\n\nService Estimates Economic Impact of Critical Habitat Designation for Fluted Kidneyshell and Slabside Pearlymussel\nApril 26, 2013\n- Stephanie Chance, 931\/528-6481, ext. 211, email@example.com\n- Tom MacKenzie, 404\/679-7291 firstname.lastname@example.org\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of a draft economic analysis considering the impact of a proposal to designate critical habitat for two freshwater mussels proposed for listing as endangered. If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.\n\nOn November 19th, the Cumberland River Compact and Friends of Warner Parks organized a volunteer event to plant more than 100 trees in Edwin Warner Park. The planting event was held as part of the Compact’s Fall Planting Party in support of their Root Nashville campaign, whose goal is to plant half a million trees in Davidson County by 2050. The tree planting event was part of the Edwin Warner Park Land and River Restoration Project, a collaborative effort between Metro Parks and Recreation, Metro Water Services, Cumberland River Compact, and Friends of Warner Parks to restore the riparian buffer zone along the Little Harpeth and improve the deterioration and erosion of the riverbank. During the event, 40 volunteers planted 123 native hardwood trees along a riparian buffer in the park. Trees planted at the site will effectively stabilize the riverbank, slow the flow of runoff in the area, and reduce the rate of erosion. “This is a restoration project we have hoped to accomplish for 20 years,” said Jenny Hannon, President of Friends of Warner Parks. “We are proud to make a collective impact with these organizations that will benefit the health of our riparian ecosystems for years to come.”\nThe Edwin Warner Park project began in May 2022 with the removal of 3 picnic shelters and associated asphalt drives along the Little Harpeth River. Since the spring, 64,000 square feet of asphalt have been removed from the area and replaced with remediated soil, trees, and native plant species. These efforts will help to decelerate runoff and mitigate erosion in the area, improving the floodway and restoring integrity to the riverbank. Mekayle Houghton, Executive Director of the Cumberland River Compact, stated: “This project will significantly improve water quality and habitat in the Little Harpeth River. It is the result of patient and collaborative project planning from many partners.”\nThis project will continue in 2023 with plans to:\n- Rebuild and relocate park shelters #9 and #10 away from the floodway. Shelter #9 will be expanded with ample green space for special events up to 300 people\n- Establish a tree and buffer planting maintenance plan to continue monitoring the area\n- Develop specific access points for the public along the Little Harpeth River to protect restored bank areas\n- Execute a comprehensive water assessment in Warner Parks streams, springs, ponds, vernal ponds, wet weather conveyances, and riparian zones to protect and enhance other riparian buffer zones in Warner Parks\n“After years of dreaming, discussions and planning, this project is well on its way to repairing the land and restoring the riparian zone for a healthier waterway and more beautiful park,” said Cammie Claybrook of Warner Parks.

Apart from direct contact, there can also be wildlife impacts both within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoir water is usually more stagnant than normal river water. As a result, the reservoir will have higher than normal amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and other aquatic weeds. These weeds can crowd out other river animal and plant-life, and they must be controlled through manual harvesting or by introducing fish that eat these plants . In addition, water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs at a much higher rate than in flowing rivers. In addition, if too much water is stored behind the reservoir, segments of the river downstream from the reservoir can dry out. Thus, most hydroelectric operators are required to release a minimum amount of water at certain times of year. If not released appropriately, water levels downstream will drop and animal and plant life can be harmed. In addition, reservoir water is typically low in dissolved oxygen and colder than normal river water. When this water is released, it could have negative impacts on downstream plants and animals. To mitigate these impacts, aerating turbines can be installed to increase dissolved oxygen and multi-level water intakes can help ensure that water released from the reservoir comes from all levels of the reservoir, rather than just the bottom (which is the coldest and has the lowest dissolved oxygen). Like many things we do, eat or get in contact with in our life, is not about absolute good or absolute bad. There are good practices and bad practices. The right thing in the wrong place generates conflicts as well as the opposite. Normally the main question is not what but instead how, how much and for how long.\n\nThe mixing of air and water, usually by bubbling air through water or by contact of water with air. The elevation that is used to help maintain a relative balance among tributary storage reservoirs. When water is drawn from tributary reservoirs, the balancing guide ensures that water is drawn equitably from each one, leaving the reservoirs at a similar position between the flood guide and the balancing guide. Cubic feet per second, typically used as a measure of flow in a stream. A cubic foot is equivalent to about 7.5 gallons. A measure of 1,000 cfs is equal to about 7,500 gallons of water per second. A marked nine-foot-draft navigation channel suitable for barge transportation on the Tennessee River and its tributaries. A measure of the volume of water accumulated at a flow rate of one cubic foot per second running for one day. A storage tank with a capacity of about 650,000 gallons would be required to store one day-second-foot of water. The oxygen dissolved in water that is necessary to sustain aquatic life.

The amount of electric power that is drawn from TVA’s electric system at a given point in time. An enclosed dam chamber with gates at each end that allow water to be admitted and released. The resulting change in water level allows vessels to be raised and lowered so they can pass over non-navigable parts of a river. The locks on the Tennessee River make navigation possible for 652 miles, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Paducah, Kentucky. Main-river, or main-stem, reservoirs\nReservoirs where the seasonal lowering to provide storage for flood damage reduction is typically less than seven feet. Main-river reservoirs include (upstream to downstream) Fort Loudoun, Watts Bar, Chickamauga, Nickajack, Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, Pickwick, and Kentucky. They were designed to serve multiple purposes, especially commercial navigation and hydropower production. An amount of energy that equals one million watt-hours. It is a common measure for electricity use over time. A release from one or more dams provided to meet hydropower production, reservoir level targets, downstream water needs (such as aquatic habitat, water supply, and waste assimilation), and other commitments. Project minimum flows are those required to be released from a specific dam over a specific time period — not the lowest amount of water that TVA can pass through a dam. System minimum flows are those needed at some point in the system to meet specific needs for power, waste assimilation, navigation, and other beneficial uses. Minimum operations guide\nThe system minimum operations guide is a seasonal guide based on the sum of the storage in 10 tributary projects. It is used to determine what level of flow should be released from these projects when additional flow is required to meet downstream needs.

And people along the banks are heading to higher ground, protecting what they can or taking it to higher ground. NECN's Josh Brogadir has more from the Blackstone Valley in Cumberland, R.I. There's been heavy rain most of the afternoon and evening, filling the already swollen Blackstone River which is expected to crest well above flood stage perhaps Wednesday or early Thursday. The Pawtuxet River - is not much better off. There are voluntary, but suggested evacuations for people living in places that flooded two weeks ago. \"I feel like Noah.\" Noah, also known as Dave Englund is unloading the first floor of his Cranston, Rhode Island home with the help of friends, and packing this ark, more commonly known as a UHaul. He lives on the edge of the\nPawtuxet River, which flooded 7 feet over its banks two weeks ago, sending debris from all the houses into his backyard. And this time, forecasters are expecting it to be even worse. \"It's supposed to be worse, (cresting at) 16 feet plus,\" said Michael Walldeck, of Cranston. Sixteen plus as in 16 feet plus. This is like a \"sandbags to save rooms\" campaign for all homeowners on Perkins Avenue, including Corinne Bird and family, who know their basements will get wet and are trying to save everything else. Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency's Steve Kass had a bit of good news for rain weary Ocean staters, explaining that President Barack Obama had just made a disaster declaration allowing for federal funding from FEMA. \"That's the best thing I've heard all day, let it rain!\" exclaimed Dave Englund. But in Cumberland along the Blackstone River, let it rain is not what they want to hear at Hope Global, a textile manufacturer where everything that can be put up on desks and tables - is off the floor. This place had $5 million in damage from flooding back in 2005 according to Cheryl Merchant, the company's CEO and President. We do hear the Blackstone could rise to 18 feet, which would be a disaster for hope Global, but if it does not overflow its banks, they've already lost a week of production having to essentially dismantle the place.\n\nHigh water of the Ohio River has caused minor flooding in the Tri-State over the past week, but the river is beginning to recede. \"The flood wave is down past the Wabash River in the Shawneetown-Golconda (Illinois) area,\" said Mary Lamm, a National Weather Service hydrologist in Paducah, Ky. However, as of Tuesday, a flood warning was still in effect for much of the Ohio River in Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. The warning area stretched from upstream of Owensboro, Ky., to Cairo, Ill. River levels were expected to stay elevated along the lower Ohio River through the end of the week. The river level crested at just under 42 feet at the Newburgh Locks & Dam late Sunday night, early Monday morning. By noon Tuesday it was down to 39 feet, still a foot above the 38-foot flood stage. At Evansville, it crested at 38.5 feet, several feet below the 42-foot flood stage there. Those levels typically bring minor flooding, such as that experienced along the river locally last week, Lamm said. \"Most places have experienced minor land flooding. There have been no moderate-to-major flooding reports. It's mostly along the main stem (Ohio River). It usually is your bottom land right along the river,\" she said. Lamm said anytime during the winter months can bring flooding. \"The soil conditions can combine with (snow) melt off. The soil is not as absorbent and there isn't as much evaporation,\" she said. High water caused the closing of Waterworks Road between Marina Pointe and U.S. 41, as well as numerous other roads, mostly in Union Township. When three Henderson, Ky., residents became stranded in a vehicle after driving into high water south of Interstate 164 on South Weinbach Avenue last Friday, the Knight Township Water Rescue team and Evansville Police Department officers had to rescue them. The vehicle was stranded in more than three feet of water. The high water and fast currents also were blamed for causing a grain barge to strike a pier on the north U.S. 41 bridge between Henderson and Evansville on Saturday afternoon. The bridge was closed two hours while it was inspected for structural damage. And high tailwater and turbulence slowed repairs on the Markland Locks & Dam upstream of Madisonville, Ind., said the Army Corps of Engineers. As the waters recede, it is creating another problem for some locks and dams. \"The biggest problem we have is as it starts to recede, we pick up a lot of drift that pulls off the bank,\" said Mike Mooney, lockmaster at the Newburgh Locks & Dam. A stiff wind blowing toward the Indiana shore can cause the drift to pile up against the locks, he said, and the towboats can also push it against the gates. \"It's just something we have to deal with,\" he said. Last weekend's snow, and the rain and snow forecast for later this week, shouldn't add to the flooding, Lamm said. But she said the river could rise again before winter ends as snow and ice upstream begin to melt. \"In the upper parts of the Ohio (River Valley), they have a decent snowpack,\" she said. Need Help?

Moderate flooding was predicted at the Harpeth River near Kingston Springs, Duck River at Columbia and Duck River at Centerville. Both the Cumberland and the Harpeth are expected to reach moderate flood stage, likely impacting greenways and industrial areas along their banks, according to NWS and Metro Nashville Water Services predictions. Flooding likely low-impact\nMetro Water Services said Saturday it does not anticipate the Cumberland downtown to rise to a level that is a concern to businesses in that area. Businesses or buildings with underground garages or structures should take precautions. The Cumberland River's flood stage is 40 feet in downtown Nashville. On Saturday night, the Cumberland River's water level was at 39.59 feet, according to NWS data. It's expected to hit 43.8 feet by Sunday evening. According to the NWS, at 42 feet, Riverfront Park is flooded to the fourth grassy area, as well as other recreational and greenway areas along the river.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5\/cubic foot construction cost). What can I Do For Nashville's Urban Canopy? · Help Nashville get more roots in the ground! The Cumberland River Compact, Nashville Tree Foundation, and many other environmental non-profits in Nashville offer free trees from September – April each year. · Keep an eye out for Emerald Ash Borer and alert a Metro Tree Advisory member if you spot it! This tiny terror is responsible for wiping out Ash trees all over North America and is expected to cost Tennessee billions. Contact Root Nashville\nfor more information! OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS\nFor each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90\/year per tree includes:\n- Regular watering\n- Pruning of suckers and shoots\n- Data collection & reporting\nSee if you qualify for\nThe Compact’s Tree Water Maintenance Program!

            "passage": "Service Estimates Economic Impact of Critical Habitat Designation for Fluted Kidneyshell and Slabside Pearlymussel\nApril 26, 2013\n- Stephanie Chance, 931\/528-6481, ext. 211, email@example.com\n- Tom MacKenzie, 404\/679-7291 firstname.lastname@example.org\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of a draft economic analysis considering the impact of a proposal to designate critical habitat for two freshwater mussels proposed for listing as endangered. If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.",

The tree planting event was part of the Edwin Warner Park Land and River Restoration Project, a collaborative effort between Metro Parks and Recreation, Metro Water Services, Cumberland River Compact, and Friends of Warner Parks to restore the riparian buffer zone along the Little Harpeth and improve the deterioration and erosion of the riverbank. During the event, 40 volunteers planted 123 native hardwood trees along a riparian buffer in the park. Trees planted at the site will effectively stabilize the riverbank, slow the flow of runoff in the area, and reduce the rate of erosion. “This is a restoration project we have hoped to accomplish for 20 years,” said Jenny Hannon, President of Friends of Warner Parks. “We are proud to make a collective impact with these organizations that will benefit the health of our riparian ecosystems for years to come.”\nThe Edwin Warner Park project began in May 2022 with the removal of 3 picnic shelters and associated asphalt drives along the Little Harpeth River. Since the spring, 64,000 square feet of asphalt have been removed from the area and replaced with remediated soil, trees, and native plant species. These efforts will help to decelerate runoff and mitigate erosion in the area, improving the floodway and restoring integrity to the riverbank. Mekayle Houghton, Executive Director of the Cumberland River Compact, stated: “This project will significantly improve water quality and habitat in the Little Harpeth River. It is the result of patient and collaborative project planning from many partners.”\nThis project will continue in 2023 with plans to:\n- Rebuild and relocate park shelters #9 and #10 away from the floodway.

These weeds can crowd out other river animal and plant-life, and they must be controlled through manual harvesting or by introducing fish that eat these plants . In addition, water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs at a much higher rate than in flowing rivers. In addition, if too much water is stored behind the reservoir, segments of the river downstream from the reservoir can dry out. Thus, most hydroelectric operators are required to release a minimum amount of water at certain times of year. If not released appropriately, water levels downstream will drop and animal and plant life can be harmed. In addition, reservoir water is typically low in dissolved oxygen and colder than normal river water. When this water is released, it could have negative impacts on downstream plants and animals. To mitigate these impacts, aerating turbines can be installed to increase dissolved oxygen and multi-level water intakes can help ensure that water released from the reservoir comes from all levels of the reservoir, rather than just the bottom (which is the coldest and has the lowest dissolved oxygen). Like many things we do, eat or get in contact with in our life, is not about absolute good or absolute bad. There are good practices and bad practices. The right thing in the wrong place generates conflicts as well as the opposite. Normally the main question is not what but instead how, how much and for how long.",

And people along the banks are heading to higher ground, protecting what they can or taking it to higher ground. NECN's Josh Brogadir has more from the Blackstone Valley in Cumberland, R.I. There's been heavy rain most of the afternoon and evening, filling the already swollen Blackstone River which is expected to crest well above flood stage perhaps Wednesday or early Thursday. The Pawtuxet River - is not much better off. There are voluntary, but suggested evacuations for people living in places that flooded two weeks ago. \"I feel like Noah.\" Noah, also known as Dave Englund is unloading the first floor of his Cranston, Rhode Island home with the help of friends, and packing this ark, more commonly known as a UHaul. He lives on the edge of the\nPawtuxet River, which flooded 7 feet over its banks two weeks ago, sending debris from all the houses into his backyard. And this time, forecasters are expecting it to be even worse. \"It's supposed to be worse, (cresting at) 16 feet plus,\" said Michael Walldeck, of Cranston. Sixteen plus as in 16 feet plus. This is like a \"sandbags to save rooms\" campaign for all homeowners on Perkins Avenue, including Corinne Bird and family, who know their basements will get wet and are trying to save everything else. Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency's Steve Kass had a bit of good news for rain weary Ocean staters, explaining that President Barack Obama had just made a disaster declaration allowing for federal funding from FEMA. \"That's the best thing I've heard all day, let it rain!\" exclaimed Dave Englund. But in Cumberland along the Blackstone River, let it rain is not what they want to hear at Hope Global, a textile manufacturer where everything that can be put up on desks and tables - is off the floor. This place had $5 million in damage from flooding back in 2005 according to Cheryl Merchant, the company's CEO and President. We do hear the Blackstone could rise to 18 feet, which would be a disaster for hope Global, but if it does not overflow its banks, they've already lost a week of production having to essentially dismantle the place.",

However, as of Tuesday, a flood warning was still in effect for much of the Ohio River in Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. The warning area stretched from upstream of Owensboro, Ky., to Cairo, Ill. River levels were expected to stay elevated along the lower Ohio River through the end of the week. The river level crested at just under 42 feet at the Newburgh Locks & Dam late Sunday night, early Monday morning. By noon Tuesday it was down to 39 feet, still a foot above the 38-foot flood stage. At Evansville, it crested at 38.5 feet, several feet below the 42-foot flood stage there. Those levels typically bring minor flooding, such as that experienced along the river locally last week, Lamm said. \"Most places have experienced minor land flooding. There have been no moderate-to-major flooding reports. It's mostly along the main stem (Ohio River). It usually is your bottom land right along the river,\" she said. Lamm said anytime during the winter months can bring flooding. \"The soil conditions can combine with (snow) melt off. The soil is not as absorbent and there isn't as much evaporation,\" she said. High water caused the closing of Waterworks Road between Marina Pointe and U.S. 41, as well as numerous other roads, mostly in Union Township. When three Henderson, Ky., residents became stranded in a vehicle after driving into high water south of Interstate 164 on South Weinbach Avenue last Friday, the Knight Township Water Rescue team and Evansville Police Department officers had to rescue them. The vehicle was stranded in more than three feet of water. The high water and fast currents also were blamed for causing a grain barge to strike a pier on the north U.S. 41 bridge between Henderson and Evansville on Saturday afternoon. The bridge was closed two hours while it was inspected for structural damage. And high tailwater and turbulence slowed repairs on the Markland Locks & Dam upstream of Madisonville, Ind., said the Army Corps of Engineers. As the waters recede, it is creating another problem for some locks and dams. \"The biggest problem we have is as it starts to recede, we pick up a lot of drift that pulls off the bank,\" said Mike Mooney, lockmaster at the Newburgh Locks & Dam. A stiff wind blowing toward the Indiana shore can cause the drift to pile up against the locks, he said, and the towboats can also push it against the gates. \"It's just something we have to deal with,\" he said. Last weekend's snow, and the rain and snow forecast for later this week, shouldn't add to the flooding, Lamm said. But she said the river could rise again before winter ends as snow and ice upstream begin to melt. \"In the upper parts of the Ohio (River Valley), they have a decent snowpack,\" she said. Need Help?

Maintenance managers oversee a team of maintenance supervisors who manage the technicians and workload during a particular shift. Depending on the size of the organization, they report to either a maintenance director, president, or VP of operations. Managers must take a “big picture” view of the maintenance department and direct the long-term vision and comprehensive effort around building systems, equipment operations, and safe production standards. They keep the company’s goals in the forefront of their minds and are where the buck stops when it comes to OSHA requirements, applicable laws, and regulations. The responsibilities of maintenance managers vary depending on the nature of the specific business. However, they typically include planning and directing overall maintenance work and coordinating responsibilities with maintenance supervisors to accomplish work in a timely and safe manner. Maintenance managers must hire, train, and develop the maintenance staff, working to keep a positive, team-oriented environment focused on delivering high-quality, safe, and efficient maintenance services. Key performance indicators include production uptime, budget adherence, schedule compliance, and safety metrics (e.g. number or incidents). - Sets vision, mission, and strategy for an entire maintenance department\n- Ensures all health, safety, and regulations are followed\n- Manages and maintains a preventive maintenance system to keep all day-to-day operations running smoothly\n- Oversees, motivates, and reviews maintenance team including management of training and professional development\n- Stays organized in facilities with robust PM schedules and continuous work requests\n- Leads maintenance supervisors in an effective, positive, and efficient manner\n- Understands and follows OSHA guidelines and other regulations\n- Exhibits problem solving and team building skills\nWho should hire a maintenance manager? Usually larger organizations require more layers of management to operate efficiently. A business, facility, or residential complex that has multiple locations, shifts, or buildings will benefit from having a maintenance manager. Maintenance managers can work with top executives to understand overall business strategy and then develop a supporting vision and mission for the maintenance department. This may include a focus on exceeding OSHA standards or other regulations, reducing downtime to increase machine efficiency, or obtaining superior customer satisfaction scores from tenants. What are the different types of maintenance managers? Different businesses require different types of maintenance managers. Below are some examples. - Plant Maintenance Manager — Ensures the operations of plant systems and equipment stays in excellent working order by managing maintenance supervisors over various shifts\n- Building Complex Maintenance Managers — Oversees supervisors who are responsible for the daily upkeep and operations of a particular building within a residential complex. They set big picture goals and manage complex-wide processes and procedures. - Facilities Maintenance Managers — Manages maintenance and engineering tasks including mechanical, electrical, and plumbing projects across an entire facility. Delegates shift-specific tasks to maintenance supervisors. - Public Works Maintenance Manager — Leads shift supervisors in various government-related departments including road maintenance, parks and recreation maintenance, and landscaping. What certifications are available for maintenance managers?

Construction managers oversee and lead a range of building projects from beginning to end. They are responsible for setting and keeping schedules, monitoring finances, and making certain that everybody is doing what they should, every day. Construction managers also help ensure that the workplace is free of safety hazards, and they deal with the various working relationships that exist on a job site. Construction Manager Job Statistics\nNearly 75 percent of construction managers in America are independent contractors hired by clients in need of managers with specific work experience. Projects that use construction managers can range from small home renovation and remodeling jobs to larger commercial projects, like office buildings, hospitals, and schools. Many clients require an education background for managers that includes a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a related field. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage in 2017 for construction managers in America was $91,370. Responsibilities of a Construction Manager\nThe specific tasks of a construction manager can vary from project to project, but many roles are standard for the position. Quality management. Construction projects quite often involve a number of contractors and subcontractors. One of the most important jobs of the construction manager is making certain everyone is doing quality work and not cutting any corners along the way. Cost management. A good construction manager is constantly on top of costs and makes the necessary adjustments when unexpected complications or issues arise. Safety management. Construction managers must identify and eliminate possible hazards for the safety of everyone on the job site. Contract administration. It is the job of the construction manager to ensure that every provision of the contract is being met and that all parties involved are satisfied. Beyond everything else, construction managers need to keep all parties involved well informed throughout the whole project. This includes the client, the architect, and any contractor or subcontractors involved. If issues arrive, the manager must be ready to deal with them immediately. Looking to Become a Construction Manager? Being an effective construction manager involves much more than just reading blueprints or spot-checking the quality of work being done. Good ones are knowledgeable about all standard building codes and often must be familiar with the latest construction practices, including environmentally friendly design and building. They need to be adept with industry-specific software and have a good working knowledge of all aspects of the job in general. In addition to work experience, construction managers often must hold at least a bachelor's degree in construction science\/management or a related discipline, such as civil engineering. As part of a related course of study, aspiring construction managers study traditional subjects like statistics, mathematics, architecture, and information technology. They also receive specialized training in subjects like site design and planning, enforcement of building codes, scheduling, and cost estimation. Construction managers possess excellent communication skills and can lead a diverse team that includes everyone involved in the process, from the client, designers, and architects to the site workers and tradespeople. Since most construction environments are fast-paced and projects are held to tight deadlines, the ability to effectively multitask is also a must for a successful construction manager. Finally, clients today increasingly want a certified construction manager for their projects. Once an aspiring manager has some real-world experience, it is in his or her best interest to obtain a few industry certifications. The Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) and American Institute of Constructors (AIC) offer certifications that are in high demand. These certifications are awarded based on a person's education level, real-world experience, and overall knowledge of the principles of construction management coupled with a written exam.\n\nThis is a course designed to cover the essential elements of Facilities Management and aid the Facilities Managers in their day to day operational delivery of services.

Innovate UK (2016) found that DEC’s were showing energy consumption was between 1.8 and 10 times above the energy figures used for compliance with Building Regulations, meaning that clients are not getting the product they are paying for, or the emissions they expected. Each DEC comes with an advisory report with recommendations for building owners and occupiers to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings. However, Clarkson Alliance believe in mitigating these factors during the design and build phase and have worked with Constructing Excellence Oxford on a research project attempting to identify the key issues and solutions to close this gap. Solutions currently being integrated into our project delivery process coming next week when we look in more detail at the Energy Performance Gap. The main construction of Littlehampton Leisure Centre began at the end of August 2017. Before the work could begin, the former leisure centre, an old dome, needed to be demolished. This demolition formed part of the enabling works. View this time lapse video showing the dome finally coming down! Video from Arun District Council\nOne of our recently completed projects, Sacrewell Mill, received funding from the HLF, whch was used to restore and preserve the building, and to develop a sustainable business plan to secure the long term future of the farm. The project included restoring the water mill – seen here in action after 50 years! The Caledonian Clock Tower project is also being supported with funding from the HLF. KPIs are measurable objectives used to evaluate the success of a project. In construction these are typically based around quality, time and cost. We work with our clients to define the outcomes of the project through a set of measurable objectives. Each objective will have relative importance in terms of achieving the desired outcomes. This shapes the strategic delivery of the project and guides the design team to develop solutions that will achieve the objectives. In order to achieve continuous improvement in the services we deliver, Clarkson Alliance also seek qualitative and quantitative client feedback which forms an additional measurement of the success of a project. In the construction industry KPIs are published each year by Constructing Excellence using performance data collected from across the UK construction sector. M+E refers to the Mechanical and Electrical systems within a construction project. The term is sometimes extended to MEP, where the ‘P’ stands for Plumbing. Mechanical systems might include plant, machinery, and heating and ventilation systems, and electrical can refer to the power supply throughout the building, lighting, telecommunications and control systems. Many systems include both a mechanical and electrical element, which has resulted in the combined term, which is also used interchangeably with ‘Building Services’. Engineering firms often specialise in both M and E systems since the two are often closely integrated. Technological developments over recent years has meant that the services offered by an M+E consultant can often incorporate the latest sustainable solutions, for example in the installation of energy efficient systems. Novation is a process by which contractual rights and obligations are transferred from one party to another. In construction, novation normally refers to the process where the design consultants are initially contracted to the client but are then ‘novated’ to the contractor. Novation is common on design and build projects where the design team are appointed by a client to carry out initial studies or prepare a concept or detailed design, but then when a contractor is appointed to carry out or complete the design and construct the works, the design team (or part of it) is novated to work for them. Novation effectively over-writes the contractual history to give the impression that the consultant has worked for the contractor throughout the project. This requires agreement by all three parties. A Quantity Surveyor – also known as a Cost Manager – provides expert advice on the cost of a construction project.\n\nQuestion:What are the main responsibilities of a Certified Energy Manager (CEM) in facilities and buildings?",

            "passage": "What does a maintenance manager do? Maintenance managers oversee a team of maintenance supervisors who manage the technicians and workload during a particular shift. Depending on the size of the organization, they report to either a maintenance director, president, or VP of operations. Managers must take a “big picture” view of the maintenance department and direct the long-term vision and comprehensive effort around building systems, equipment operations, and safe production standards. They keep the company’s goals in the forefront of their minds and are where the buck stops when it comes to OSHA requirements, applicable laws, and regulations. The responsibilities of maintenance managers vary depending on the nature of the specific business. However, they typically include planning and directing overall maintenance work and coordinating responsibilities with maintenance supervisors to accomplish work in a timely and safe manner. Maintenance managers must hire, train, and develop the maintenance staff, working to keep a positive, team-oriented environment focused on delivering high-quality, safe, and efficient maintenance services. Key performance indicators include production uptime, budget adherence, schedule compliance, and safety metrics (e.g. number or incidents). - Sets vision, mission, and strategy for an entire maintenance department\n- Ensures all health, safety, and regulations are followed\n- Manages and maintains a preventive maintenance system to keep all day-to-day operations running smoothly\n- Oversees, motivates, and reviews maintenance team including management of training and professional development\n- Stays organized in facilities with robust PM schedules and continuous work requests\n- Leads maintenance supervisors in an effective, positive, and efficient manner\n- Understands and follows OSHA guidelines and other regulations\n- Exhibits problem solving and team building skills\nWho should hire a maintenance manager? Usually larger organizations require more layers of management to operate efficiently. A business, facility, or residential complex that has multiple locations, shifts, or buildings will benefit from having a maintenance manager. Maintenance managers can work with top executives to understand overall business strategy and then develop a supporting vision and mission for the maintenance department. This may include a focus on exceeding OSHA standards or other regulations, reducing downtime to increase machine efficiency, or obtaining superior customer satisfaction scores from tenants. What are the different types of maintenance managers? Different businesses require different types of maintenance managers. Below are some examples. - Plant Maintenance Manager — Ensures the operations of plant systems and equipment stays in excellent working order by managing maintenance supervisors over various shifts\n- Building Complex Maintenance Managers — Oversees supervisors who are responsible for the daily upkeep and operations of a particular building within a residential complex. They set big picture goals and manage complex-wide processes and procedures. - Facilities Maintenance Managers — Manages maintenance and engineering tasks including mechanical, electrical, and plumbing projects across an entire facility. Delegates shift-specific tasks to maintenance supervisors. - Public Works Maintenance Manager — Leads shift supervisors in various government-related departments including road maintenance, parks and recreation maintenance, and landscaping. What certifications are available for maintenance managers? Those aspiring to become maintenance managers can apply for the following certifications to advance their careers. - Maintenance Management Certification (MMC) — Several of the country’s top engineering schools offer certification programs.

            "passage": "The purpose of the certificate is to:\n- Raise public awareness of energy consumption of public buildings\n- Promote the improvement of energy performance of buildings\n- Help building owners identify and improve the energy efficiency of their buildings\n- Increase transparency of energy efficiency\nThe certificates have helped highlight significant issues in industry relating the Energy Performance gap – the disparity between a buildings designed energy performance and their actual performance in use. Innovate UK (2016) found that DEC’s were showing energy consumption was between 1.8 and 10 times above the energy figures used for compliance with Building Regulations, meaning that clients are not getting the product they are paying for, or the emissions they expected. Each DEC comes with an advisory report with recommendations for building owners and occupiers to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings. However, Clarkson Alliance believe in mitigating these factors during the design and build phase and have worked with Constructing Excellence Oxford on a research project attempting to identify the key issues and solutions to close this gap. Solutions currently being integrated into our project delivery process coming next week when we look in more detail at the Energy Performance Gap. The main construction of Littlehampton Leisure Centre began at the end of August 2017. Before the work could begin, the former leisure centre, an old dome, needed to be demolished. This demolition formed part of the enabling works. View this time lapse video showing the dome finally coming down! Video from Arun District Council\nOne of our recently completed projects, Sacrewell Mill, received funding from the HLF, whch was used to restore and preserve the building, and to develop a sustainable business plan to secure the long term future of the farm. The project included restoring the water mill – seen here in action after 50 years! The Caledonian Clock Tower project is also being supported with funding from the HLF. KPIs are measurable objectives used to evaluate the success of a project. In construction these are typically based around quality, time and cost. We work with our clients to define the outcomes of the project through a set of measurable objectives. Each objective will have relative importance in terms of achieving the desired outcomes. This shapes the strategic delivery of the project and guides the design team to develop solutions that will achieve the objectives. In order to achieve continuous improvement in the services we deliver, Clarkson Alliance also seek qualitative and quantitative client feedback which forms an additional measurement of the success of a project. In the construction industry KPIs are published each year by Constructing Excellence using performance data collected from across the UK construction sector. M+E refers to the Mechanical and Electrical systems within a construction project. The term is sometimes extended to MEP, where the ‘P’ stands for Plumbing. Mechanical systems might include plant, machinery, and heating and ventilation systems, and electrical can refer to the power supply throughout the building, lighting, telecommunications and control systems. Many systems include both a mechanical and electrical element, which has resulted in the combined term, which is also used interchangeably with ‘Building Services’. Engineering firms often specialise in both M and E systems since the two are often closely integrated. Technological developments over recent years has meant that the services offered by an M+E consultant can often incorporate the latest sustainable solutions, for example in the installation of energy efficient systems. Novation is a process by which contractual rights and obligations are transferred from one party to another. In construction, novation normally refers to the process where the design consultants are initially contracted to the client but are then ‘novated’ to the contractor. Novation is common on design and build projects where the design team are appointed by a client to carry out initial studies or prepare a concept or detailed design, but then when a contractor is appointed to carry out or complete the design and construct the works, the design team (or part of it) is novated to work for them. Novation effectively over-writes the contractual history to give the impression that the consultant has worked for the contractor throughout the project. This requires agreement by all three parties. A Quantity Surveyor – also known as a Cost Manager – provides expert advice on the cost of a construction project.",

Read his blog in the Hong Kong Economic journal here:\nI was a fellow traveler in the 1972 Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars trip to China with Richard Bernstein and Jonathan Mirsky . . . and in other ways with Richard Kagan and Edward Friedman who followed in 1975 and 1978 (Friedman and I visited rural Hebei in 1978 and then spent the next quarter century trying to fathom and write collaboratively about China’s rural transformations). All five of us were or had been active members of CCAS, two of whose primary goals were ending the US War in Indochina and opening diplomatic relations with The People’s Republic of China. My experience in this first China visit was framed by my recent experience with CCAS and the anti-war movement, and my understanding of America’s Asian wars, military base structures, and the US-China relationship, as well as my research on the Chinese revolution.\n\nIn 1919, the Soviets had drafted something called the Karakhan Manifesto, named after the deputy commissioner for foreign affairs, Lev Karakhan, which renounced all Russian concessions in China. This included privileges like extraterritoriality, where Russian citizens wouldn’t face Chinese courts for crimes committed in China, and special economic concessions. And, if you will recall from episode 11 on the 1911 revolution, how the revolutionary plotters were arrested in the Russian Settlement Area in Wuhan, there were areas in some treaty port cities like Wuhan which were administered by Russians and not by China. So the Soviet Union renounced all these semi-colonial privileges. The one concession that the Soviet Union held on to was control of the China Eastern Railway, which crossed Manchuria and connected Vladivostok with the rest of Siberia much more directly than the circuitous route which wended around China’s northern border. In the original draft of the Karakhan Manifesto, the Soviets gave the railway back to China as well, but by the time it was formally presented to China in early 1920, they had thought better of it. The Manifesto also renounced Russia’s share of the massive and burdensome Boxer indemnity, which you will recall the details on from episode nine. Regardless, when the Soviets formally presented the Karakhan Manifesto to China, it elicited an instant and massive wave of pro-Soviet feeling in China. After the humiliations of the Versailles Treaty which sparked the May 4th Movement and the ongoing depredations of the European, American and Japanese imperialists, the Karakhan Manifesto showed the Soviet Union to be a foreign power of a different stripe, and it came to be considered, at least for a time, as a friend of China. Voitinsky and his delegation rode in to China, very deliberately, immediately in the wake of the good feeling generated by the Karakhan Manifesto. This period of Sino-Soviet goodwill allowed him a freedom of movement and openness in his activities that earlier, clandestine or semi-clandestine Soviet forays into China had not enjoyed. Voitinsky’s mission in China was to make contact with Chinese radicals and to help them to begin a process which might lead to the founding of a communist party if they could be won over to see the necessity of founding a party. Voitinsky’s first stop was in Beijing, where he met with Li Dazhao and many of Li’s students from Beijing University who had been active in the Common People’s Education Lecturing Corps. These were students who had been going out to try to unite the student and workers’ movements, like we discussed in episode 13. Many of these students also participated in something called the Morning Garden Society, which was a large anarchist collective household. Li Dazhao and his students formed something called the Society for the Study of Marxist Theory, which was basically a study group so that they could all learn more about Marxism. There seems to have been some ambivalence about the ultimate purpose of this study group. Voitinsky’s aim in encouraging Li to found this group was the create a Beijing nucleus for the later formation of the Communist Party, and this is in fact the role that the study group ended up playing. But at least initially, it seems like Li and many of the participants in the study group did not have aspirations for the group beyond furthering their knowledge of Marxist theory. The real organizational initiative for founding the party would come from the second communist nucleus formed with Voitinsky’s help, in Shanghai. In May 1920 Voitinsky met with Chen Duxiu in Shanghai. Chen had relocated to Shanghai to get out of reach of the northern warlords after being jailed for three months in 1919 for his political activities in Beijing. As we noted in episode 13, Chen had lost his faith in the power of education to change China, and was more and more interested in the Bolshevik model for social change being played out in the Soviet Union. Voitinsky’s offer to help Chinese radicals move in the direction offered by the Russian Revolution was more or less exactly what Chen was looking for, and soon after Voitinsky’s arrival in Shanghai, a Marxist Research Society was formed. This study group included not only Chen, but other senior radicals, some of whom had been active in bringing socialist ideas to China already.\n\nOn December 24, 1894 at Gutian she wrote : “One more Christmas nearly gone – one year nearer to heaven.”\nOn August 1, 1895 she, the Saunders sisters and the Stewarts with some of their children were among eleven foreigners massacred by members of the Vegetarian sect7 at Huashan. In one of the last letters she wrote before her death Miss Cooke sadly commented that the Singapore girls were closely connected with those who had been murdered. But for Chitnio, Wee Inn and the others in Fujian it was business as usual. Chitnio was assisting with training biblewomen and accompanying foreign missionary women on their visits to villages. Miss Bushell visited Wee Inn (wife of the Rev Yek Sui Mi) in Fuqing (Hok Chiang) in 1897 and found her as busy as ever. Wee Inn had three sons and one daughter and Miss Bushell commented: “Her family is quite a model of good behaviour, brought up carefully and nicely. She is certainly a most earnest and good woman – her light shines brightly.”\nAbove: The mission houses at Huashan. The Stewarts were in the upper one and the single women in that below it.

Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.\n\nThus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its \"modern form.\" Zuo writes: \"Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. \"55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a \"second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '\"57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: \"Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. \"58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: \"Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. \"59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter \"modern.\" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along \"two basic tracks.\" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. \"Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,\" he notes, \"oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. \"60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field's [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies. Some of the more troubling implications are discussed in the following section. Oral History as a Regime of Social Disciplining in China?\n\nKissinger's declaration on Taiwan prompted\nZhou to say what he had not yet said, that he was optimistic about\nSino-American rapprochement: \"the prospect for a solution\nand the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two\ncountries is hopeful.\" 10: Memorandum of conversation, 23 February 1972, 9:35 a.m. Source: Nixon Presidential Materials Project, NSC\nFiles, HAK Office Files, box 92, Dr. Kissinger's Meetings in the\nPRC During the Presidential Visit February 1972\nThe possibility of a Nixon trip to China had been reaffirmed\nduring Kissinger's secret visit. During the months between the\nsecret visit and Nixon's February 1972 trip, Kissinger tilted\nU.S. policy closer and closer to China in order to strengthen\nthe U.S. posture toward the Soviet Union. As a sign that the United\nStates was committed to friendly relations with Beijing, during\nthe Nixon visit, Kissinger provided Marshal Ye Jianying, one of\nthe four marshals (see document 3)\nwith a top secret intelligence briefing on Soviet force deployments\nat the Chinese border. As Kissinger pointed out, the briefing\nwas so secret that not even senior U.S. intelligence officials\nknew about it. (Note 4)\n1.

Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President\nYahya to \"convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest\nlevel\" that he believed that 1) \"Asia can not move forward\nif a nation as large as China remains isolated,\" and 2) the\nUnited States would not be \"party to any arrangements designed\nto isolate China.\" With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, \"The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,\" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card. (Note 1)\n4: Front page of People's Daily, 25 December 1970, showing\nfrom left, Edgar Snow, interpreter Ji Chaozhu, Mao Zedong, and\nLin Biao, at a reviewing stand facing Tiananmen Square on 1 October\nSource: Library of Congress\nIn another attempt to signal to the U.S. government but also\na domestic audience about the need for a new relationship with\nthe United States, on 1 October 1970 (National Day), Mao had journalist\nEdgar Snow stand by him at the Gate of Heavenly Peace during the\nparade. Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours\nof talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the\n[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting\nAmericans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist. Had the debriefing gone ahead,\nNixon could have learned that Mao had invited him to China, months\nbefore Snow made it public in Life magazine at the end\nof April 1971.

Kissinger Telephone Conversation Transcripts (Telcons),\nNixon Presidential Materials Project, National Archives II, College\nPark, MD., box 29. On April 14, 1971, only days after the visit of the U.S. ping\npong team to China, Nixon announced measures to liberalize trade\nand travel restrictions affecting China.\n\nOnly colleagues at Peking University told her that to their knowledge, oral history was not being done in China.5 A decade later, Bruce Stave, visiting China as a Fulbright professor in 1984–1985, wrote that all knowledge about oral history in China seemed to be hidden \"behind walls.\" Although he found evidence of oral history practices going back to the 1930s, he argued that \"oral history, in the western sense of institutionalized archives easily open to academic and public researchers, still appears to be far in the future. \"6 Two years later, Thompson and Thompson, after a visit to China, asserted that oral history hardly existed, that cassette recorders were nearly impossible to get, and that political repression kept many topics taboo. \"After thirty years of bitter political struggle, China is full of feuds, vendettas and painful memories,\" they wrote in Oral History in 1987. \"Researchers daren't ask, and people daren't answer. \"7 According to the Thompsons, it was mostly Westerners who did oral history in China. Yet they also noted that there had been a flurry of recording people's stories going on throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s—just like Stave, however, they did not know where to find these records or what to make of them.8\nWriting in the same issue of Oral History, the Chinese historian Yang Liwen provided a different picture of oral history in China.9 He said that even during those difficult years, tape recorders were more commonly used than the Thompsons had believed. He admitted that it was unclear how much of these efforts was archived or published.10 In 1992, Luke S. K. Kwong, who had studied in Hong Kong and Toronto, taught at Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1976 to 1989, and then joined the history department of the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, published what [End Page 3] appears to be still the most extensive English-language survey of twentieth-century oral history in China.11 In this article, he argued that Westerners were confused because they had applied too narrow a definition of oral history. He pointed out that Morrison's timing was bad—she had tried to conduct interviews in the middle of the Cultural Revolution, when it was not really wise to be open and frank, and her understanding of oral history, Kwong wrote, \"cannot be taken as an all-inclusive, sufficient definition. \"12 Kwong took Stave to task for presenting oral history in China as a \"puzzle.\" Stave's confusion, Kwong argued, resulted not from the actual situation but rather was the result of his narrowly American understanding of oral history, which emphasized \"an organized 'movement,'\" \"tape-recorded interviews,\" \"central archives,\" and \"legal releases. \"13\nYet, although Kwong undersold Stave's contribution (which I will describe below), what he unearthed was significantly more than what any Western observer had previously described. In hindsight, after my return from Beijing, I was surprised that I had not heard about those projects. Considering the restrictions posed by language and time, I should not have been surprised; but it motivated me to dig deeper and learn more about this history. For good reasons, I was ignorant of this history, but I began to wonder: was the mass of the oral history iceberg just as invisible in China as elsewhere? Did I not hear about this history of oral history in China because my colleagues did not have access to earlier projects, if, as the Thompsons speculated, some of the records were lost or kept in government or party vaults? Even the material researchers produced since the 1980s may be difficult to access, as a CCOH colleague later pointed out to me: [End Page 4] some books are out of print and cassette tapes may be languishing in less-than-pristine conditions in private homes (an all-too-familiar story).14 Or did I not hear about earlier projects because Chinese oral historians now employ Stave's \"narrow\" definition of oral history as a means to develop standards and to distinguish their work from the earlier research? Before describing my admittedly extremely limited impressions of the current state of oral history in China and especially the work at the CCOH, I will in the following give a brief overview of oral history in China up to the 1990s. Three Thousand Years of Oral History?\n\nGradually the focus of the Project began to from other world areas -- China, Europe, and Islamic civilization -- to India. By 1953, as Singer notes in his article \"Robert Redfield,\" the organizers had \"decided to concentrate the Projects resources on the study of Indian civilization because of the interest and availability of anthropologists who had recently done Indian village studies.\" Participants were quick to conclude \"that while village studies can be used as points of entry for a study of Indian civilization, they were not the only available points.\" At the same time, Redfield and Singer \"sketched somewhat speculatively a conceptual framework for studying the formation and transformation of cities\" within particular civilizations, including that of India. Their jointly authored paper, \"The Cultural Role of Cities,\" offered a \"conception of a civilization as a historic structure of interacting little and great traditions,\" and provided the blueprint for a social anthropology of civilizations that would study larger civilizational systems \"from the bottom up.\" Subsequently they created a set of core courses in non-Western civilizations at Chicago and established South Asia as an area of particular interest to Chicago scholars pursuing questions of social change in a rapidly modernizing world. The towards India within the Redfield Project, as it came to be known, was given its most explicit expression in a memo from Singer to Redfield, written shortly after Singers return from his first trip to India in 1955. In it, Singer argues for committing the next five years of the Comparative Civilizations Project solely to India:\nIndia remains, in my opinion, the best place to study the interaction of little and great traditions, the social organization of tradition, \"cultural structure,\" and related problems. The coexistence of different levels of culture for a very long period of time has produced types of mutual interaction and continuity which in other civilizations can only be guessed at but which in India can be observed first-hand. During the ensuing decade, the earnest scholarship begun with Redfields Comparative Civilizations Project fostered new projects focused on South Asia. The Project had established a model of cultural study which, largely through the continuing efforts of Singer, was transmitted to the developing South Asian program at Chicago. It had emphasized study of other cultures for broadly humanistic reasons, not tied to any governmental definition of the national interest as was fashionable in the 1950s. It aimed not at producing useful expertise, but at increasing international understanding. Finally, it had stressed the study of India as a civilization, not (as most area studies did) as a geographical or political entity. The emphasis on classical traditions and cultural history still informs the Chicago program today. A Committee for South Asian Studies\nSouth Asian studies at Chicago is currently organized under six units, each contributing to the breadth of Chicagos scholarly programs. The next cases trace the development of these units: 1) the Committee on Southern Asian Studies (COSAS); 2) the South Asian Civilization teaching program in the undergraduate college; 3) the South Asian Languages and Area Center (SALAC); 4) the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations; 5) the South Asia library collection; and 6) the University of Chicago Press. South Asian studies at the University of Chicago was made possible by the arrival in the early 1950s of several professors who shared a deep interest in the area. India was a newly independent democracy with a long historical tradition. Many established scholars chose to pursue their particular disciplines in India when the recently-created Fulbright and Rockefeller grants began supporting research abroad. By 1954, professors at Chicago who had benefited from such grants -- including Robert Redfield, Milton Singer, Edward Shils, Richard McKeon, Bert Hoselitz, Donald Lach, Philip Hauser, Gilbert White, Francis Chase and Robert Crane -- began to meet as an informal planning committee. In 1955 that informal planning developed into the Committee on South Asian Studies (COSAS). (The name was later changed to the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, reflecting the contribution of Southeast Asian specialists to the program.) The formation of a Committee composed of faculty from different academic departments was assisted by a tradition of interdisciplinary cooperation at the University of Chicago. COSAS became an official Committee with four major aims: coordinating research activities, recommending and preparing undergraduate-level teaching materials, developing advanced programs for graduate students specializing in South Asia, and providing facilities and guidance for South Asian students.\n\n- Wet Ink\n- Men’s Sports\n- Women’s Sports\n- Club & Intramural Sports\n- Out of Bounds\n- The Penn Print\n- Contact Us\nDuring her research experience in China in 2001, an African-American doctoral student at the University of Southern California said she may have been the only black person that the Chinese people ever saw. Keisha Brown traveled to China four times in the last 12 years to research “China’s media depictions of and diplomatic exchanges with African-Americans during their struggle for freedom and equality from 1949-1972,” according to the Six O’Clock Series pamphlet. She said that while she was there, a group of Chinese people pulled her out of a crowd and asked if they could take a picture with her simply because she was black. That interaction could have created the view of the entire African-American race for those people, Brown said. Brown discussed her experiences of “traveling while black” at the Six O’Clock Series Monday night, titled “My Experiences as an African-American Woman Researching China” in the Hadley Union Building Ohio Room. “There was a huge interest in Africans in China until ’72 and then after that it dropped off, and I’m trying to figure out why,” Brown said as the starting point of her talk. Brown said her interest in Sino-Black relations, or Chinese culture in general, began with a high school teacher of hers who taught Chinese. “It was she who got me to China for the first time in the summer of 2001,” Brown said. Brown said she learned Mandarin because this woman broke down the language for her and made it easy for her to comprehend. She wasn’t fluent the first time she went, but she had a good foundation to succeed. Brown explained the importance of the African-American people who made the way for Sino-Black relations, such as Eslanda Goode Robeson, who Brown said was “in terms of timeline, the first African-American to visit the PRC (People’s Republic of China).” Singer Aubrey Pankey was also instrumental in this movement toward Sino-Black relations by performing classical songs and Negro spirituals for PRC events during his time. “Some of the Negro spirituals had Chinese translations as well as a paragraph synopsis of the meaning of the songs so that the audience could follow along,” Brown said. These people were so influential because during that time, and even today, hardly any African American people live in China, Brown said. Living there, she said, was a burden on her to realize how much her professionalism and character influenced the way Chinese people could stereotype African-Americans. Brown said she finds the Chinese culture fascinating because of the cultural blending. She recounted pictures of a traditional rickshaw with McDonald’s advertising on it. “[It] was a nice mix of the old and the new,” she said. She also said she was shocked when she realized that the parrots in China speak Chinese and not English, a trivial fact that offered a big perspective shift. In providing some history into Sino- Black relations, Brown showed posters of propaganda from the PCR supporting the struggle of African-Americans. One of the posters from 1963 read, “Firmly support American Blacks in their righteous struggle!”\nThe PCR wanted to side with the African-Americans to bring down American imperialism. Brown said that it is a “Maoist ideal that a successful struggle against racism will lead to a class struggle that would hopefully evolve into the implosion of American imperialism.”\nAfter an hour of Brown’s experiences, history and reasons behind her studies, she revealed her future plans to study the relations of the Chinese and African-Americans in the 1980s and possibly even today. She also wants to study interactions between them on individual level, such as how they are treated personally by the Chinese. “I also want to teach, so hopefully I can start to work on that now,” Brown said. Amanda Rose (junior, applied anthropology), an African-American with an Asian studies minor, said she attended the series because she would like to study abroad in China. “A lot of African-American students are afraid to study abroad, but the talk gave me another view. It really was relevant to my life and what I want to do,” Rose said.\n\nQuestion:When did the first group of scholars from CCAS visit China, and who was involved?",

            "passage": "In 1919, the Soviets had drafted something called the Karakhan Manifesto, named after the deputy commissioner for foreign affairs, Lev Karakhan, which renounced all Russian concessions in China. This included privileges like extraterritoriality, where Russian citizens wouldn’t face Chinese courts for crimes committed in China, and special economic concessions. And, if you will recall from episode 11 on the 1911 revolution, how the revolutionary plotters were arrested in the Russian Settlement Area in Wuhan, there were areas in some treaty port cities like Wuhan which were administered by Russians and not by China. So the Soviet Union renounced all these semi-colonial privileges. The one concession that the Soviet Union held on to was control of the China Eastern Railway, which crossed Manchuria and connected Vladivostok with the rest of Siberia much more directly than the circuitous route which wended around China’s northern border. In the original draft of the Karakhan Manifesto, the Soviets gave the railway back to China as well, but by the time it was formally presented to China in early 1920, they had thought better of it. The Manifesto also renounced Russia’s share of the massive and burdensome Boxer indemnity, which you will recall the details on from episode nine. Regardless, when the Soviets formally presented the Karakhan Manifesto to China, it elicited an instant and massive wave of pro-Soviet feeling in China. After the humiliations of the Versailles Treaty which sparked the May 4th Movement and the ongoing depredations of the European, American and Japanese imperialists, the Karakhan Manifesto showed the Soviet Union to be a foreign power of a different stripe, and it came to be considered, at least for a time, as a friend of China. Voitinsky and his delegation rode in to China, very deliberately, immediately in the wake of the good feeling generated by the Karakhan Manifesto. This period of Sino-Soviet goodwill allowed him a freedom of movement and openness in his activities that earlier, clandestine or semi-clandestine Soviet forays into China had not enjoyed. Voitinsky’s mission in China was to make contact with Chinese radicals and to help them to begin a process which might lead to the founding of a communist party if they could be won over to see the necessity of founding a party. Voitinsky’s first stop was in Beijing, where he met with Li Dazhao and many of Li’s students from Beijing University who had been active in the Common People’s Education Lecturing Corps. These were students who had been going out to try to unite the student and workers’ movements, like we discussed in episode 13. Many of these students also participated in something called the Morning Garden Society, which was a large anarchist collective household. Li Dazhao and his students formed something called the Society for the Study of Marxist Theory, which was basically a study group so that they could all learn more about Marxism. There seems to have been some ambivalence about the ultimate purpose of this study group. Voitinsky’s aim in encouraging Li to found this group was the create a Beijing nucleus for the later formation of the Communist Party, and this is in fact the role that the study group ended up playing. But at least initially, it seems like Li and many of the participants in the study group did not have aspirations for the group beyond furthering their knowledge of Marxist theory. The real organizational initiative for founding the party would come from the second communist nucleus formed with Voitinsky’s help, in Shanghai. In May 1920 Voitinsky met with Chen Duxiu in Shanghai. Chen had relocated to Shanghai to get out of reach of the northern warlords after being jailed for three months in 1919 for his political activities in Beijing. As we noted in episode 13, Chen had lost his faith in the power of education to change China, and was more and more interested in the Bolshevik model for social change being played out in the Soviet Union. Voitinsky’s offer to help Chinese radicals move in the direction offered by the Russian Revolution was more or less exactly what Chen was looking for, and soon after Voitinsky’s arrival in Shanghai, a Marxist Research Society was formed. This study group included not only Chen, but other senior radicals, some of whom had been active in bringing socialist ideas to China already.",

            "passage": "Two people that I met in China died recently. Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.",

            "passage": "Thus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its \"modern form.\" Zuo writes: \"Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. \"55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a \"second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '\"57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: \"Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. \"58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: \"Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. \"59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter \"modern.\" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along \"two basic tracks.\" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. \"Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,\" he notes, \"oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. \"60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field's [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies. Some of the more troubling implications are discussed in the following section. Oral History as a Regime of Social Disciplining in China?",

            "passage": "So far\nno U.S. account of the meeting has surfaced but Ambassador Hilaly\ndebriefed Harold Saunders on the discussions several weeks later. Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President\nYahya to \"convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest\nlevel\" that he believed that 1) \"Asia can not move forward\nif a nation as large as China remains isolated,\" and 2) the\nUnited States would not be \"party to any arrangements designed\nto isolate China.\" With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, \"The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,\" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card. (Note 1)\n4: Front page of People's Daily, 25 December 1970, showing\nfrom left, Edgar Snow, interpreter Ji Chaozhu, Mao Zedong, and\nLin Biao, at a reviewing stand facing Tiananmen Square on 1 October\nSource: Library of Congress\nIn another attempt to signal to the U.S. government but also\na domestic audience about the need for a new relationship with\nthe United States, on 1 October 1970 (National Day), Mao had journalist\nEdgar Snow stand by him at the Gate of Heavenly Peace during the\nparade. Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours\nof talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the\n[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting\nAmericans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist. Had the debriefing gone ahead,\nNixon could have learned that Mao had invited him to China, months\nbefore Snow made it public in Life magazine at the end\nof April 1971.

            "passage": "Only colleagues at Peking University told her that to their knowledge, oral history was not being done in China.5 A decade later, Bruce Stave, visiting China as a Fulbright professor in 1984–1985, wrote that all knowledge about oral history in China seemed to be hidden \"behind walls.\" Although he found evidence of oral history practices going back to the 1930s, he argued that \"oral history, in the western sense of institutionalized archives easily open to academic and public researchers, still appears to be far in the future. \"6 Two years later, Thompson and Thompson, after a visit to China, asserted that oral history hardly existed, that cassette recorders were nearly impossible to get, and that political repression kept many topics taboo. \"After thirty years of bitter political struggle, China is full of feuds, vendettas and painful memories,\" they wrote in Oral History in 1987. \"Researchers daren't ask, and people daren't answer. \"7 According to the Thompsons, it was mostly Westerners who did oral history in China. Yet they also noted that there had been a flurry of recording people's stories going on throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s—just like Stave, however, they did not know where to find these records or what to make of them.8\nWriting in the same issue of Oral History, the Chinese historian Yang Liwen provided a different picture of oral history in China.9 He said that even during those difficult years, tape recorders were more commonly used than the Thompsons had believed. He admitted that it was unclear how much of these efforts was archived or published.10 In 1992, Luke S. K. Kwong, who had studied in Hong Kong and Toronto, taught at Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1976 to 1989, and then joined the history department of the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, published what [End Page 3] appears to be still the most extensive English-language survey of twentieth-century oral history in China.11 In this article, he argued that Westerners were confused because they had applied too narrow a definition of oral history. He pointed out that Morrison's timing was bad—she had tried to conduct interviews in the middle of the Cultural Revolution, when it was not really wise to be open and frank, and her understanding of oral history, Kwong wrote, \"cannot be taken as an all-inclusive, sufficient definition. \"12 Kwong took Stave to task for presenting oral history in China as a \"puzzle.\" Stave's confusion, Kwong argued, resulted not from the actual situation but rather was the result of his narrowly American understanding of oral history, which emphasized \"an organized 'movement,'\" \"tape-recorded interviews,\" \"central archives,\" and \"legal releases. \"13\nYet, although Kwong undersold Stave's contribution (which I will describe below), what he unearthed was significantly more than what any Western observer had previously described. In hindsight, after my return from Beijing, I was surprised that I had not heard about those projects. Considering the restrictions posed by language and time, I should not have been surprised; but it motivated me to dig deeper and learn more about this history. For good reasons, I was ignorant of this history, but I began to wonder: was the mass of the oral history iceberg just as invisible in China as elsewhere? Did I not hear about this history of oral history in China because my colleagues did not have access to earlier projects, if, as the Thompsons speculated, some of the records were lost or kept in government or party vaults? Even the material researchers produced since the 1980s may be difficult to access, as a CCOH colleague later pointed out to me: [End Page 4] some books are out of print and cassette tapes may be languishing in less-than-pristine conditions in private homes (an all-too-familiar story).14 Or did I not hear about earlier projects because Chinese oral historians now employ Stave's \"narrow\" definition of oral history as a means to develop standards and to distinguish their work from the earlier research? Before describing my admittedly extremely limited impressions of the current state of oral history in China and especially the work at the CCOH, I will in the following give a brief overview of oral history in China up to the 1990s.

            "passage": "Gradually the focus of the Project began to from other world areas -- China, Europe, and Islamic civilization -- to India. By 1953, as Singer notes in his article \"Robert Redfield,\" the organizers had \"decided to concentrate the Projects resources on the study of Indian civilization because of the interest and availability of anthropologists who had recently done Indian village studies.\" Participants were quick to conclude \"that while village studies can be used as points of entry for a study of Indian civilization, they were not the only available points.\" At the same time, Redfield and Singer \"sketched somewhat speculatively a conceptual framework for studying the formation and transformation of cities\" within particular civilizations, including that of India. Their jointly authored paper, \"The Cultural Role of Cities,\" offered a \"conception of a civilization as a historic structure of interacting little and great traditions,\" and provided the blueprint for a social anthropology of civilizations that would study larger civilizational systems \"from the bottom up.\" Subsequently they created a set of core courses in non-Western civilizations at Chicago and established South Asia as an area of particular interest to Chicago scholars pursuing questions of social change in a rapidly modernizing world. The towards India within the Redfield Project, as it came to be known, was given its most explicit expression in a memo from Singer to Redfield, written shortly after Singers return from his first trip to India in 1955. In it, Singer argues for committing the next five years of the Comparative Civilizations Project solely to India:\nIndia remains, in my opinion, the best place to study the interaction of little and great traditions, the social organization of tradition, \"cultural structure,\" and related problems. The coexistence of different levels of culture for a very long period of time has produced types of mutual interaction and continuity which in other civilizations can only be guessed at but which in India can be observed first-hand. During the ensuing decade, the earnest scholarship begun with Redfields Comparative Civilizations Project fostered new projects focused on South Asia. The Project had established a model of cultural study which, largely through the continuing efforts of Singer, was transmitted to the developing South Asian program at Chicago. It had emphasized study of other cultures for broadly humanistic reasons, not tied to any governmental definition of the national interest as was fashionable in the 1950s. It aimed not at producing useful expertise, but at increasing international understanding. Finally, it had stressed the study of India as a civilization, not (as most area studies did) as a geographical or political entity. The emphasis on classical traditions and cultural history still informs the Chicago program today. A Committee for South Asian Studies\nSouth Asian studies at Chicago is currently organized under six units, each contributing to the breadth of Chicagos scholarly programs. The next cases trace the development of these units: 1) the Committee on Southern Asian Studies (COSAS); 2) the South Asian Civilization teaching program in the undergraduate college; 3) the South Asian Languages and Area Center (SALAC); 4) the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations; 5) the South Asia library collection; and 6) the University of Chicago Press. South Asian studies at the University of Chicago was made possible by the arrival in the early 1950s of several professors who shared a deep interest in the area. India was a newly independent democracy with a long historical tradition. Many established scholars chose to pursue their particular disciplines in India when the recently-created Fulbright and Rockefeller grants began supporting research abroad. By 1954, professors at Chicago who had benefited from such grants -- including Robert Redfield, Milton Singer, Edward Shils, Richard McKeon, Bert Hoselitz, Donald Lach, Philip Hauser, Gilbert White, Francis Chase and Robert Crane -- began to meet as an informal planning committee. In 1955 that informal planning developed into the Committee on South Asian Studies (COSAS). (The name was later changed to the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, reflecting the contribution of Southeast Asian specialists to the program.) The formation of a Committee composed of faculty from different academic departments was assisted by a tradition of interdisciplinary cooperation at the University of Chicago. COSAS became an official Committee with four major aims: coordinating research activities, recommending and preparing undergraduate-level teaching materials, developing advanced programs for graduate students specializing in South Asia, and providing facilities and guidance for South Asian students.",

Keisha Brown traveled to China four times in the last 12 years to research “China’s media depictions of and diplomatic exchanges with African-Americans during their struggle for freedom and equality from 1949-1972,” according to the Six O’Clock Series pamphlet. She said that while she was there, a group of Chinese people pulled her out of a crowd and asked if they could take a picture with her simply because she was black. That interaction could have created the view of the entire African-American race for those people, Brown said. Brown discussed her experiences of “traveling while black” at the Six O’Clock Series Monday night, titled “My Experiences as an African-American Woman Researching China” in the Hadley Union Building Ohio Room. “There was a huge interest in Africans in China until ’72 and then after that it dropped off, and I’m trying to figure out why,” Brown said as the starting point of her talk. Brown said her interest in Sino-Black relations, or Chinese culture in general, began with a high school teacher of hers who taught Chinese. “It was she who got me to China for the first time in the summer of 2001,” Brown said. Brown said she learned Mandarin because this woman broke down the language for her and made it easy for her to comprehend. She wasn’t fluent the first time she went, but she had a good foundation to succeed. Brown explained the importance of the African-American people who made the way for Sino-Black relations, such as Eslanda Goode Robeson, who Brown said was “in terms of timeline, the first African-American to visit the PRC (People’s Republic of China).” Singer Aubrey Pankey was also instrumental in this movement toward Sino-Black relations by performing classical songs and Negro spirituals for PRC events during his time. “Some of the Negro spirituals had Chinese translations as well as a paragraph synopsis of the meaning of the songs so that the audience could follow along,” Brown said. These people were so influential because during that time, and even today, hardly any African American people live in China, Brown said. Living there, she said, was a burden on her to realize how much her professionalism and character influenced the way Chinese people could stereotype African-Americans. Brown said she finds the Chinese culture fascinating because of the cultural blending. She recounted pictures of a traditional rickshaw with McDonald’s advertising on it. “[It] was a nice mix of the old and the new,” she said. She also said she was shocked when she realized that the parrots in China speak Chinese and not English, a trivial fact that offered a big perspective shift. In providing some history into Sino- Black relations, Brown showed posters of propaganda from the PCR supporting the struggle of African-Americans. One of the posters from 1963 read, “Firmly support American Blacks in their righteous struggle!”\nThe PCR wanted to side with the African-Americans to bring down American imperialism. Brown said that it is a “Maoist ideal that a successful struggle against racism will lead to a class struggle that would hopefully evolve into the implosion of American imperialism.”\nAfter an hour of Brown’s experiences, history and reasons behind her studies, she revealed her future plans to study the relations of the Chinese and African-Americans in the 1980s and possibly even today. She also wants to study interactions between them on individual level, such as how they are treated personally by the Chinese. “I also want to teach, so hopefully I can start to work on that now,” Brown said. Amanda Rose (junior, applied anthropology), an African-American with an Asian studies minor, said she attended the series because she would like to study abroad in China. “A lot of African-American students are afraid to study abroad, but the talk gave me another view. It really was relevant to my life and what I want to do,” Rose said.",

I’m so proud of him.”Sign up for Home Turf and get 3 exclusive stories every SoCal sports fan must read, sent daily. Subscribe here.Scioscia, 59, bristles at any talk about his personal record. He is quick to say “these aren’t my wins,” acknowledging they are a product of work by the players, the coaches and the front office.He also said he still doesn’t feel he’s in the class with Lasorda, who won two World Series in his 21 years leading the Dodgers and has been inducted into the Hall of Fame.“Just knowing what Tommy did for the Dodgers, what my role is here, you can’t compare,” Scioscia said. “What Tommy did for the Dodgers’ organization is special. I certainly don’t put myself in that boat, but having the opportunity to be here as long as I have is something I do not take for granted.” Scioscia certainly could not have envisioned this when he was hired to manage the Angels in November 1999, during the Bill Clinton administration. Today, the Angels have prospects who weren’t even born then.Scioscia has managed the Angels for 19 years. No other big league manager has had his current job longer than the 12 seasons Bruce Bochy has led the San Francisco Giants. Kansas City’s Ned Yost is third, in his ninth season.Both Bochy (24 seasons) and Buck Showalter (20) have managed more years than Scioscia, but with different teams.Holding one job for so long is virtually unheard of today. Only San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who has held his position since 1996, can top Scioscia among coaches or managers in the four major sports. Even Bill Belichick got his current coaching job with the New England Patriots a few months after the Angels hired Scioscia.Scioscia’s job security has certainly been helped by the fact that owner Arte Moreno gave him a guaranteed 10-year contract in January 2009, after they had won a World Series and four division titles in his first nine years.That contract expires at the end of this season. Although there has been no word of an extension, there’s also no indication from Scioscia, Moreno or General Manager Billy Eppler that either side is looking to end the relationship.While some Angels fans have been critical of Scioscia during a drought that has seen them miss the playoffs in seven of the previous eight years, those around him believe he still does a good job.Mike Scioscia, seen giving a fist bump to Angels starting pitcher Andrew Heaney, right, is within four victories of surpassing mentor and former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda in career managerial wins.

He graduated from St. Mary’s in 1958, having attained both the Cambridge School Certificates Div. 1 and Cambridge University Higher School Certificate. At the Cambridge School Certificate level he obtained distinctions in Chemistry, Botany and Mathematics and became the first student to gain three (3) distinctions in Science subjects at one sitting. At the Higher School Certificate level he concentrated on Science-based subjects and was among the first group of St. Lucian students to pass three Science Subjects – Chemistry, Botany and Zoology in 1958. From an early age the young George had acquired skills for the science-based subjects and he continued further education at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad where he graduated in 1963 gaining a B.Sc. (Agric) with General Honors. In 1964 he entered the University of Reading in London and attained a M.Agr. Sc in Soil Science with specialty in Soil Chemistry. Between the years 1972-1999, Mr. George pursued a number of additional courses among which were: Land Use Planning, Project Preparation and Analysis, Food Systems Development\/Economic Analysis of Agricultural Projects, Farming Systems Research and Development; Programme Evaluation; Monitoring and Evaluation of Agricultural Research, Strategic Planning and Research Management, and Utility Reform Management from a wide range of institutions, such as ODA-Directorate of Overseas Surveys United Kingdom, Clapp and Mayne Inc.; Universities of Florida and Minnesota, and the Adam Smith Institute. Mr. George started his working career as a Junior Science Master at St. Mary’s College in the year 1959. From there he worked for 2 years before proceeding to further his studies at University level. He then worked as an Agronomist at Windward Islands Banana Research. Later he joined the Ministry of Agriculture where he served as Research Officer and on occasions as Chief Agricultural Officer. In 1979 he joined the regional organization Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) as the Head of the local Unit. Then in 1988, he was made Project Manager of the CARDI\/USAID Farming Systems Research and Development Project and had responsibility for all the OECS countries. He also served in the capacity as Deputy Executive Director and from 1990-1993, the Executive Director of CARDI, having to relocate at Headquarters in Trinidad. Upon leaving CARDI Mr. George worked as the Managing Director of St. Lucia Banana Growers Association, Tempere Estate, and Alvan Estate in St. Lucia. Mr. George has always kept abreast with the political directorate and the politics in St. Lucia and as such, it was in 1979 that he became the President of the Senate under the leadership of the St. Lucia Labour Party. Through this medium he was made the Minister of Communications, Works, Transport and Public Utilities for the period 1997-2001. It was under his tenure that St. Lucia and the other OECS countries saw a turn to liberalization of the Telecommunications Industry in these countries. He was unanimously elected to serve as Chairman of the Ministers responsible for Telecommunications for two consecutive terms. In 2001, when the Labour party won for the second time, Mr. George was made the new Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. With his wealth of knowledge and experience in that field, he brought new perspective into that Ministry and sought to bring about a revival of the declining Banana Industry. He also directed his energies towards the development of a long term Agricultural Development Policy and provided strategic approaches to the revitalization of the Agricultural Industry. Unfortunately, after a cabinet reshuffle in early 2004 George was transferred from Agriculture to the new Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security, a ministry that embraces the Police, Prison and Immigration. Mr. George has served on the board of a number of professional, as well as non professional organizations, such as the National Commission for UNESCO, Technical Advisory Committee of the OECS Agricultural Diversification Unit, the Caribbean Food Crops Society and International Root Crop Society, Chief negotiator, OECS Telecommunications Reform; Member - Board of Governors, CARDI; Chairman - Board of Governors, CARDI; Panel member, Agricultural Science Panel CXC, Commissioner - Land Reform Commission, St. Lucia; St. Lucia Civil Service Association just to name a few.\n\nProvidenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands, June 21, 2022 – Invest Turks and Caicos Agency (Invest TCI), in collaboration with Digicel, The Office of the Premier and The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), hosted the President’s Luncheon – Collaborating for Capacity Development: Strengthening national capacities to establish and maintain food security partnerships as part of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Caribbean Development Bank’s Board of Governors. The luncheon took place on Wednesday, June 14th, 12pm-2pm at Beaches Turks & Caicos Resort Village and Spa, Key West Village. The luncheon brought together 50 attendees, including members of Government, MSMEs in the agricultural sector, representatives from major resorts, and the business community to hear from the Ministry of Agriculture and special guest speaker, Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina; President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) on the topic of food security. In her address to the attendees, the Honourable Josephine Connolly, Minister of Agriculture, stated, “We have clear goals to achieve a level of food security as articulated in our Plan for Empowerment of our people. Our focus is on creating a strong, sustainable sector that would empower social development through, among other things, increased local food production. We have a thriving fishing industry, and our goals for sustainability, food production, and meeting growing local demands are the same in this industry. Guest Speaker Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the AfDB, shared his view and lessons for the Caribbean from the AfDB’s experiences on food security during the luncheon. Dr. Adesina highlighted that in both the Caribbean and Africa, the negative impacts of climate change are felt in the agricultural sector and this, combined with looming shortages prompted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, threatens food security. He elaborated on the Bank’s use of technologies in the African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) programme and its role in helping to deliver climate smart seeds to farmers in several African countries and in so doing, these countries have been able to get ahead of current wheat shortages. Under the TAAT programme, Sudan reduced wheat importation by 50% in two years, while Ethiopia was able to cut wheat imports altogether. The AfDB also recently approved the $1.5 billion African Emergency Food Production Facility to help advance food security in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Dr. Adesina stated, “We all agreed it is time to support Africa to produce its food. It is time to have food sovereignty. The same must apply to the Caribbean. A recent survey by CARICOM and the World Food Program shows that food insecurity has increased by 72% among the population of the English speaking Caribbean countries,” said Dr. Adesina. “Food aid cannot feed Africa. Food aid cannot feed the Caribbean. Africa and the Caribbean need seeds in the ground and mechanical harvesters to harvest bountiful food produced locally,” he stressed. Commenting on the event, CEO of Invest TCI Angela Musgrove noted, “The conversation on collaborating for capacity development to establish and maintain food security partnerships is not just an imperative but long overdue. Invest TCI was pleased to bring our small businesses to the table to be a part of the dialogue. As stakeholders, each of us has a role to play as we recognize the urgency for developing and transforming the agriculture sector in the Turks and Caicos to a level of self-sufficiency.

Even as we grieve their passing, we should stop to examine the lives of these great men and women and extract lessons that will help us to make the most of the time we have left. Captain Horace Burrell, affectionately called ‘Cappo’, was a leader, a patriot, a military man, a father, a family man, an entrepreneur, businessman and diplomat. He died at 67 years old, but managed to accomplish many great things in the time that he spent on planet Earth. There is much to learn from his approach to leadership, business and life. Here are 10 lessons we extracted from his very full life. 1. Be the leader. Anyone who worked with the Captain will tell you that he rose to the occasion of leadership as often as it became necessary. He was in charge of the Jamaica Defence Force’s football team, president of the Bakers’ Association of Jamaica, vice-president of the Caribbean Football Union, chairman of CONCACAF’s disciplinary committee, president of the Jamaica Football Federation and Football Foundation of Jamaica, vice-president of the Jamaica Olympic Association … the list is impressive. There’s a lesson there for us: do not be afraid to lead. If you see the need, if you know you have what it takes to get the job done and make a positive impact, don’t shy away from the task. Step forward with boldness and grace … and be the leader. 2. Serve your country. ‘The President’, as he was sometimes called, demonstrated his love for his country through his service to it. He was a military man, and gave over 10 years of service before retiring to pursue other interests. As a successful businessman (founder and CEO of The Captain’s Bakery and The Captain’s Aviation Services), he gave back by sponsoring many local sporting events. He also lent his administrative expertise to the growth and development of Jamaican football without reservation. He served Jamaica, and he did it well. 3. Pursue multiple passions with excellence. The Captain was a military man, a baker, a businessman, and a sports enthusiast. He rose to great heights in all of these fields. It shows that it is possible to successfully pursue more than one passions. But what is the key? Bringing a consistent set of values to the table – being and pursuing excellence in all things. The Captain demonstrated this in every field he became involved in. His consistent excellence enabled him to repeatedly win confidence and attain success. 4. Build for the long term. Many credit The Captain with laying the foundation for successful football administration in Jamaica. He didn’t just build to meet the JFF’s short term needs, but rather ensured that the organisational premise was laid for continuity many years hence. Today, the JFF has an organisational structure that enables its smooth oversight on a large-scale national level, and smooth operation on a small-scale parish level. That’s long-term thinking. 5. Plan for the short term. A popular example? The tremendous amount of forethought and planning that went into Jamaica’s pursuit of qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup Finals. After he was elected president of the JFF, The Captain initiated the Football Foundation of Jamaica with the aim of gathering the financial and technical support required to ensure that the country was immediately equipped to qualify for FIFA games that would take place four years later. 6. Don’t be afraid to be unpopular. Don’t be afraid to do what is necesssary, or make the tough decisions as a leader. In The Captain’s own words shortly after being elected president of the JFF: “As a leader, one cannot be afraid to make decisions, even if it means being unpopular; there will be no room for incompetence.”\n7. Be decisive. be firm and clear on your values, and then be decisive in your actions. As the Captain made clear when running the JFF: “Anyone failing to perform effectively, efficiently or scrupulously, I would have no hesitation in removing that individual immediately.”\n8. Ignore the naysayers. There will be detractors and naysayers for any endeavour you undertake in life. There will always be those people who try to impede your progress. Sometimes, it is best to ignore these naysayers and run with the vision you know you have. The Captain served in the JFF for many years.\n\nWhat motivated you to pursue Agricultural\/Applied Economics as a profession? I had a great professor. Dr. Josef Broder taught me Introduction to Agricultural Economics. I was loathing taking economics, but Dr. Broder showed me that economics can help us address real problems, ones that I saw in my rural, predominately African American community. In a later class, with the enthusiasm for economics I learned in my introductory class, I wrote a paper on the determinants of teen pregnancy in rural Georgia. With Dr. Broder’s support I presented that work in the Student Section of the AAEA, my first professional meeting. His early intervention, engagement, and mentoring led me to this profession. Why did you join AAEA, and how has membership in the Association impacted your professional development? Early on I learned that engagement in the AAEA is vital to career success, but I stayed connected to the AAEA because of mentors like Dr. Ralph Christy and Dr. Daniel Sumner who encouraged me professionally and personally. I do not believe that I would be a full professor if I had not continued with the AAEA. What advice would you give to an up and coming Agricultural\/Applied Economist? Connect with other good researchers. Support your colleagues and pull for the good of the whole. Read broadly and engage scholars beyond economics. Take risks. Don’t forget you did not get here on your own. Live in equanimity.\n\n“Our department continues to watch our alumni reach new successes and positively impact the world, and I am proud that Mr. Vitelli has received the Outstanding Young Alumni award for his achievements in higher education.”\nStory by AEC\nPhotos provided by Kati Lawson\nFor Kati Lawson, the Department of Agricultural Education and Communication (AEC) has been closely woven into her life, but there is a common thread that seems to pull everything together: mentorship. As a high school student from Okeechobee, Florida, Lawson was bound and determined to attend Flagler College in Saint Augustine. Yet, her parents, with other intentions, carefully persuaded her to tour the University of Florida (UF). It was on this tour that Lawson met an individual that today she regards as a close mentor. His name was Dr. Ricky Telg, and he still works as a teacher, researcher, adviser and mentor for many in AEC today. It was the interaction that Lawson and Telg had that guided her to redefine her dream and attend UF for her undergraduate degree. “I actually chose AEC because of Dr. Telg,” said Lawson. “Basically, I wanted to take any classes he was teaching.”\nShe found both Telg’s mentorship and expertise invaluable as she considered her future career in journalism. With yet another unexpected turn, Lawson found herself moving back to Okeechobee for a career in teaching, a profession she fell in love with while educating fifth grade at her local elementary school. She let this newly discovered passion guide her to pursue and obtain a master’s degree from Angelo State University, where she studied education in guidance and counseling. Telg’s mentorship travels with many of his students, Lawson included, far beyond commencement. One of the ways he does so is by sending out current job postings to his former students. One such email called Lawson’s attention to a posting for a lecturer in AEC, housed in the UF\/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at Plant City. While Lawson was intrigued, her first move wasn’t to edit her résumé and draft a cover letter. Instead, she gave her mentor a call. At the time, Lawson was working as a College and Career Counselor at a local high school, but getting back into the classroom and reconnecting with AEC was especially appealing. It turns out, that phone call with Telg was the push she needed. Today, Lawson can be found teaching AEC undergraduate students in Plant City, specializing in the communication and leadership development classes. She strives to teach her students in the same way she was taught. “Dr. Telg’s biggest strength is that he teaches to the student and not just the curriculum,” she said. “He doesn’t teach all his students the same, but he treats them all fairly.”\nLawson hopes that she can serve as just as much of a mentor and resource for her students in Plant City as she had during her undergraduate career. “Plant City is unique because I am able to work directly with local industry professionals and then tailor the curriculum to fit local needs,” Lawson said. “I know my students are gaining valuable skills that make them especially equipped to enter the workforce right her in their community.”\nThose industry relationships also help her connect students with potential career opportunities upon graduation, just like Telg does for his students, Lawson included. Kati is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in AEC, specializing in agricultural communication of course, under the continued leadership and support of her mentor and friend, Dr. Ricky Telg. Guest Blog by Heather Ryan\nPhotos provided by Heather Ryan\n“Our partisan divide exists only between the engaged and the apathetic.” This statement was powerfully spoken at a pivotal chapter of my early collegiate career. These words have since served as the pillar foundation for each of my experiences as an undergraduate student in the department of Agricultural Education & Communication (AEC) at the University of Florida (UF). Leadership, public service, and community development have been the central themes of my extracurricular pursuits that allow me to mobilize diverse people groups together not only on campus, but throughout the surrounding Gainesville community as a collective. Thanks to the support offered through the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, I have shared the privilege and joy of serving as 1 of 4 students in the year-long fellowship program downtown at City Hall. Our roles span across a widespread set of skills and disciplines including visual design, urban planning, and policy research.\n\nIt's the economy\nAs Jamaica welcomes 2015 today, business, civic and religious leaders have acknowledged that issues related to the economy had the greatest impact on the nation over the past year. Jamaica's performance under the $1.2-billion economic programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been listed as the top item to be celebrated. The islandwide outbreak of the chikungunya virus (chik-V), the 18 per cent reduction in murders and the West Kingston Commission of Enquiry rounded out the four things sector leaders said had a major impact on Jamaican life in 2014. For Jamaica Manufacturers' Association President Brian Pengelley, the implementation of the IMF programme and the willingness of all stakeholders to stay the course made it an easy call. \"If we hadn't done that, we would have been in very big trouble. It's a very simple reason,\" Pengelley emphasised. While noting the adverse impact on public-sector employees, Oneil Grant, president of the Jamaica Civil Service Association, agreed, saying Jamaicans would have been worse off if the country did not meet the conditions laid out by the IMF as well as contain expenses. \"The sacrifices made by all of the partners would have come to naught if we were not able to achieve those,\" Grant argued. Last year, Jamaica passed all\nthree IMF tests - six dating back to the last financial year. This means the country met all the quantitative targets set by the US-based lending institution. However, for Dennis Chung, executive director of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica and Erica Wynter, president of the Young Entrepreneurs Association, the lost man-hours caused by the chik-V outbreak had a greater impact. \"The one that might have had the biggest impact was the chikungunya in terms of a one-time incident,\" he told The Gleaner yesterday. Wynter went further, asserting that the chik-V outbreak left many businesses, especially the smaller ones, devastated. \"Imagine you as a small business owner with a staff complement of five persons and you had sometimes four or five persons out because of chik-V. I think it affected us more than the larger entities because they would have the resources to bounce back easily; we do not,\" she explained. The Reverend Karl Johnson, general secretary of the Jamaica Baptist Union, said the reduction in the number of persons killed this year \"has to be something to celebrate\". \"It is all tied up, for me, in the fact that I believe one of the great challenges of our beloved country is to develop and sustain a wholesome ethic of life,\" Johnson argued. But Donovan Walker, president of the Jamaican Bar Association, believes the West Kingston Commission of Enquiry could turn out to be a watershed moment for Jamaica. According to him, if the enquiry is conducted properly, the nation could start getting answers to one of the \"greatest massacres of Jamaican citizens since the Morant Bay rebellion\". \"We really do need, as a country, to have answers to those questions. So what is important is that the enquiry is conducted, not for political gain, not for sound bites, but to get to the heart of what caused it and preventing this from ever happening again,\" he said of the enquiry into the 2010 police-military operations in the west Kingston community of Tivoli Gardens. Walker said what will be interesting is to see how the Government responds to the findings of the commission.\n\nOne of the things that I found most inspiring about the week was meeting the scholars from around the world and hearing their stories. It has started the process of opening my eyes to agriculture in other countries and their issues but also to how the agriculture industry fits into communities around the world. The range of speakers throughout the week was excellent and I think they really highlighted some of the strengths of New Zealand and the New Zealand culture. It also increased my understanding of our country and different rural industries within which I have not had much to do with in the past such as the mining industry. I thought the Friday session with Richard was fantastic as it emphasised the importance of the integrity of the work carried out and the standard of research that is required. I think that it also helped everyone to really think about how their individual project and how the results from this could be of benefit to the community and industry. It made us all think about what our role as a leader in our community and how not only the research itself but the skills developed can be used to help our local community and the greater industry. It was great to hear how people‟s topics have been moulded due to the discussions that had occurred throughout the week. Not only did the CSC provide inspiration and enthusiasm but also fantastic contacts. The conference enabled contacts to be made globally and friendships to be forged. I know that having met these scholars I feel a lot more comfortable contacting not only scholars from my year but also past scholars whilst travelling around the world. It has also enforced the \"Nuffield family\" concept which I have heard so much about. I left the CSC inspired and full of enthusiasm to get underway with my research. It has helped me to clarify my project and I have made some fantastic friendships in the process. I feel very honoured to have been selected for this opportunity and know that I have a life-changing year ahead! Speakers at the 2011 CSC were:\n- Milton Suzuki. Bayer CropScience Brazilian agriculture development in a global perspective (8.3 MB Powerpoint file)\n- Hayley Moynihan. Rabobank Global agribusiness outlook –higher prices and greater volatility to reign? (1.1 MB PDF file)\n- Dr. David Hughes. Emeritus Professor of Food Marketing \"Story Food\" versus \"Feeding the Family Food\": Different strokes for different folks (7.0 MB Powerpoint file)\n- Alistair Polsen. Special Agricultural Trade Envoy, NZ\n- James Su Hao. GM and Director, East Rock Limited, China\n- Todd McLay MP\n- John Allen CEO MFAT\n- Professor Jacqueline Rowarth\n- Hon. David Carter\n- Peter Yealands\n- Dick Davison\n- Penny Mossman. Acting Principal, Amuri Area School\n- Norm Williamson. Chairman Amuri Irrigation\n- Steve Sterne. Patoa Farms\n- John Palmer\n- Richard Higham\n- Andrew & Anne-Mary Benton\n- Sam Johnson\n- Eugenie Sage\n- Mark Pizey\n- Gareth Thomas\n- Jo Stratford\n- Paul Thomas\n- Peter O'Sullivan\nA personal perspective of the 2011 conference by Nuffield Ireland Scholar, Amii Cahill\nBefore leaving home for the 2011 Nuffield Contemporary Scholars Conference in New Zealand, we were sent each scholar's profile and it was hard to imagine how individuals involved in such diverse agricultural enterprises, in terms of both product and scale, would have much in common. However, it soon transpired that the issues impacting on many of us are similar across our businesses. Day one involved all scholars giving a brief presentation on themselves and their area of study, followed by an exercise to understand each other's communities. This clearly showed that, although our communities are very different, the issues affecting them are very comparable. In my opinion this type of interaction was when we as a group benefitted most from the trip. Despite a lack of sleep being a common issue throughout the week, I feel the varied range of speakers managed to cater for the interest of all scholars. As the group originated from all corners of the globe, there was of course an element of 'the same but different' thrown into discussions. Some items that caused a level of disagreement between attendees included GE (Genetically Enhanced) products, although ultimately agreement was reached on the need for a balanced and scientific approach to such technologies. Another related to the pros and cons of farming on a large scale. I did hear that old adage mentioned 'it's not size that matters, it's what you do with it', but I will leave you to draw your own conclusions on the origin of the statement.\n\nAddendum: Personal Impact & Testimonies\nRichard placed enormous emphasis on the need for informed collaboration in order to achieve meaningful change. As mentioned in the paper, he wrote in his introduction to the second edition of The Growth Illusion of the need for a “substantial number of people” to accept the necessity move beyond a growth-based economy, in order for a “new path for humanity” to be able to open up. He was also strikingly lacking in arrogance, to the extent that he frequently did not claim credit for his own work. One of the last pieces of writing he contributed to, a paper for the Irish electricity supply board entitled “Aggressive Mutuality,” was not even signed by him. A tribute to him on the Feasta website, by a group in Waterford, describes how when he was invited to give a talk there he used public transport and stayed in budget accommodation (in marked contrast to a ‘celebrity’ economist who insisted on red-carpet treatment). In this author’s view, this attitude affected the whole ethos of Feasta in a profound way. His impact was impressively wide, cutting across many professional boundaries. In preparing this paper we sent out a request to people who knew Richard asking for information about his impact on their lives. Below is a brief sample of quotes from some of the replies we received, along with quotes from some previously existing commentary on Richard’s impact. You can read still more tributes to Richard from around the world, including China and India, on his memorial page. David Korten, the US-based author of When Corporations Rule the World and founder of Yes magazine, wrote in 2000 that Richard “has more effectively than anyone else in my experience challenged the orthodox view that economic growth is essential to eliminating poverty and improving the quality of life for all”. He added that his debt to Richard is “considerable”. Mark Garavan, the current chair of Feasta’s board of directors, did research on Feasta’s role as an Irish NGO in the early 2000s which included extensive input from Richard. As mentioned above he saw Feasta, under the leadership of Richard, as taking a new approach to environmental activism, going beyond the traditional dichotomy of protest versus co-option by the powerful: “In Feasta, not only might activism have moved beyond protest, but environmental politics may also have moved beyond the political arena as traditionally conceived.”\nAnne Ryan, a lecturer in adult education at Maynooth university in Ireland and Feasta trustee, mentioned in her commentary to us that “his works are widely cited and drawn on by scholars and activists in the field of sustainability, resilience and social justice.” She describes him as “an intellectual cornerstone of the environmental movement in Ireland and a model independent public intellectual and activist.”\nAlso in academia, Tina Evans, a professor in sustainability studies in Colorado, commented that “He was well ahead of his time. Actually, he was right where we all need to be in our thinking about issues of sustainability and economy, but most people are not there yet.” She uses his work extensively in her lecturing. Rob Hopkins, a prominent campaigner in the Transition Towns movement and author of The Transition Handbook, commented in a video made for Feasta that “I was really honoured to live in Ireland during the time that Feasta started and to see how it emerged under the compassionate, committed and visionary leadership that the late, much missed and very dear Richard Douthwaite brought to the whole thing.”\nBarbara Panvel, co-ordinator of the New Era Network that is active in Britain and India, described Richard as a ‘much valued member’ of the Network. David Hirst, an inventor and consultant in information technology, wrote that Richard’s was “a huge boost” to him in promoting his inventions concerning electricity and tariffs that could help the electricity system become more sustainable and renewable. Roy Johnston, a physicist and systems analyst, described how Richard’s economic thinking seems to him to provide a way beyond traditional Marxist analysis: “there is scope for development here in addressing the problem of how politically to make a transformation towards democratic ownership of the capital investment process”. He regrets not having had time to interact more with Richard during his lifetime. Phoebe Bright, a former trader at the London Stock Exchange, commented that “had I not read Richard’s book, had I not been bold enough to call him with a question and found a new friend, my life would have been much the poorer.\n\nThen, at Middle Tennessee, I taught what amounts to Journalism 101, I guess,\nand Ethics of the Media. L: That was after you retired? L: How long were you teaching? J: About three years. L: But you had a terrible automobile accident in 1984. L: A head-on collision in Alabama. L: Gloria, your wife, was very badly injured. J: Yes. She never walked again, except with a walker. L: What year did Gloria die? L: So, you lived out there, in Nashville, until what year? J: I moved down here about 1986, or something like that, about two years after the\nL: So essentially, you taught up until 1986? J: Right. I have done some since, but not anything to be very proud of. L: What would you say was your influence on the Florida Press Association over\nthe years? Because you were very active, I know, from 1955 until 1978. J: Yes. Well, as I said, when I went to my first meeting of Florida Press, the guy\nwho was publisher is dead now, from Arcadia. His son was, later on, publisher of\nthe Sun. I have forgotten what this guy's name was, a common name but he\nwas publisher of the Gainesville Sun. The family was headquartered in Arcadia. Anyway, his old man took me around and introduced me. Once in a while, he\nwould say, we ought to go over there and meet him, but he is a son of a bitch;\nyou do not have to meet him. Then, he would take me somewhere else. But, I\nwas just impressed by it, to be so welcomed. I had served on both the Louisiana\nPress and the Mississippi Press. I was impressed with this one because it ran\nwell. It had things to do and did them. It did not have meetings where everybody\nwants to go a different way. It went nice, and I enjoyed that. That was one of the\nreasons I kept going. As I said, the other [reason was that] Punta Gorda is a bad\nplace to stay in all your life, so to get out to a convention, it was pretty good. But,\nthat is the reason I got, more or less, involved in everything. Then, [John] Paul\n[Jones] would keep you pretty busy. Somebody has to judge other state papers,\nso I always enjoyed doing that. L: Was there a lot of friction between the weeklies and the dailies in those days? J: No, there was not for a very good reason. When the legislature passed the one-\nvote-one-man thing, that killed the weeklies in Florida because they could go in\nand see the governor or anybody they wanted to, any time they wanted to. I\nguess they still can but, anyway, that was the thing, that the weeklies knew the\ncandidates and incumbents better than the dailies did by a damn sight. L: Why is that? J: Well, we had at that time quite a few active publishers in north Florida, other\nsmall towns, and they had always traveled with the candidates, maybe, or\nsomething else in their county because that was the only big news you had. So,\nthe weeklies got closer to anybody than would the dailies. The dailies always\nhad one or two stories that nobody liked, or something like that. It was easy to\npiss on them, you know? All of sudden when I started writing editorials...I am not\nsaying I was the originator, but the British newspaper I guess had the idea best. You know, this was the end of the line for weekly papers and small people up\nand down the state, that never again would they have this kind of power. L: Because they reapportioned? L: They reapportioned according to population strength, rather than size, and gave\none person one vote. J: That was right. In other words, Miami in those days had three votes in [the]\n[Florida] House [of Representatives]. Now, they have [four times] that, which is\nL: So, that gave the dailies more influence. J: Oh yes. The dailies had considerably more influence. The weeklies had no\ninfluence at all any more. I mean, who wants to kowtow to the guy who is\npublisher in Starke, which [has] nothing beside the prison. So that changed the\nwhole state around. That made the power of St. Petersburg and Orlando. L: How did that affect the FPA?\n\nQuestion:What was Ricky Allport's professional role and what impact did his passing have on the Caribbean agricultural sector?",

Villalobos, on Monday presented the institution’s 2011-2014 plan for the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in a meeting held at the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington, DC.Villalobos explained that said program has four principal objectives: to promote agricultural productivity; to improve the sanitary aspects of plants and animals; to support agribusinesses and agricultural tourism; and to face climate change and promote agricultural productivity for food safety.The head of IICA was accompanied by IICA’s associate deputy director and representative in the United States, David Hatch, and by the representatives of the delegations to CARICOM of Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.Caribbean News Now Tweet\nClippers, Mavericks brace for the unknown in Game 4 Lasorda also said he never thought of Scioscia, the player, becoming a manager, but once he did, he knew he’d be a good one.“I was worried about him beating me out,” Lasorda said by phone on Monday. “It took a better man than me. He is great. I am happy for him. He is one of the greatest managers and greatest players that God ever put on this earth. I’m so proud of him.”Sign up for Home Turf and get 3 exclusive stories every SoCal sports fan must read, sent daily. Subscribe here.Scioscia, 59, bristles at any talk about his personal record. He is quick to say “these aren’t my wins,” acknowledging they are a product of work by the players, the coaches and the front office.He also said he still doesn’t feel he’s in the class with Lasorda, who won two World Series in his 21 years leading the Dodgers and has been inducted into the Hall of Fame.“Just knowing what Tommy did for the Dodgers, what my role is here, you can’t compare,” Scioscia said. “What Tommy did for the Dodgers’ organization is special. I certainly don’t put myself in that boat, but having the opportunity to be here as long as I have is something I do not take for granted.” Scioscia certainly could not have envisioned this when he was hired to manage the Angels in November 1999, during the Bill Clinton administration. Today, the Angels have prospects who weren’t even born then.Scioscia has managed the Angels for 19 years. No other big league manager has had his current job longer than the 12 seasons Bruce Bochy has led the San Francisco Giants. Kansas City’s Ned Yost is third, in his ninth season.Both Bochy (24 seasons) and Buck Showalter (20) have managed more years than Scioscia, but with different teams.Holding one job for so long is virtually unheard of today. Only San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who has held his position since 1996, can top Scioscia among coaches or managers in the four major sports. Even Bill Belichick got his current coaching job with the New England Patriots a few months after the Angels hired Scioscia.Scioscia’s job security has certainly been helped by the fact that owner Arte Moreno gave him a guaranteed 10-year contract in January 2009, after they had won a World Series and four division titles in his first nine years.That contract expires at the end of this season. Although there has been no word of an extension, there’s also no indication from Scioscia, Moreno or General Manager Billy Eppler that either side is looking to end the relationship.While some Angels fans have been critical of Scioscia during a drought that has seen them miss the playoffs in seven of the previous eight years, those around him believe he still does a good job.Mike Scioscia, seen giving a fist bump to Angels starting pitcher Andrew Heaney, right, is within four victories of surpassing mentor and former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda in career managerial wins.

            "passage": "Profile Of Hon Calixte George\nCalixte George was born in St. Lucia and had his early education at the Roman Catholic Boys School before attending the premier Secondary School on the island - St. Mary’s College. He graduated from St. Mary’s in 1958, having attained both the Cambridge School Certificates Div. 1 and Cambridge University Higher School Certificate. At the Cambridge School Certificate level he obtained distinctions in Chemistry, Botany and Mathematics and became the first student to gain three (3) distinctions in Science subjects at one sitting. At the Higher School Certificate level he concentrated on Science-based subjects and was among the first group of St. Lucian students to pass three Science Subjects – Chemistry, Botany and Zoology in 1958. From an early age the young George had acquired skills for the science-based subjects and he continued further education at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad where he graduated in 1963 gaining a B.Sc. (Agric) with General Honors. In 1964 he entered the University of Reading in London and attained a M.Agr. Sc in Soil Science with specialty in Soil Chemistry. Between the years 1972-1999, Mr. George pursued a number of additional courses among which were: Land Use Planning, Project Preparation and Analysis, Food Systems Development\/Economic Analysis of Agricultural Projects, Farming Systems Research and Development; Programme Evaluation; Monitoring and Evaluation of Agricultural Research, Strategic Planning and Research Management, and Utility Reform Management from a wide range of institutions, such as ODA-Directorate of Overseas Surveys United Kingdom, Clapp and Mayne Inc.; Universities of Florida and Minnesota, and the Adam Smith Institute. Mr. George started his working career as a Junior Science Master at St. Mary’s College in the year 1959. From there he worked for 2 years before proceeding to further his studies at University level. He then worked as an Agronomist at Windward Islands Banana Research. Later he joined the Ministry of Agriculture where he served as Research Officer and on occasions as Chief Agricultural Officer. In 1979 he joined the regional organization Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) as the Head of the local Unit. Then in 1988, he was made Project Manager of the CARDI\/USAID Farming Systems Research and Development Project and had responsibility for all the OECS countries. He also served in the capacity as Deputy Executive Director and from 1990-1993, the Executive Director of CARDI, having to relocate at Headquarters in Trinidad. Upon leaving CARDI Mr. George worked as the Managing Director of St. Lucia Banana Growers Association, Tempere Estate, and Alvan Estate in St. Lucia. Mr. George has always kept abreast with the political directorate and the politics in St. Lucia and as such, it was in 1979 that he became the President of the Senate under the leadership of the St. Lucia Labour Party. Through this medium he was made the Minister of Communications, Works, Transport and Public Utilities for the period 1997-2001. It was under his tenure that St. Lucia and the other OECS countries saw a turn to liberalization of the Telecommunications Industry in these countries. He was unanimously elected to serve as Chairman of the Ministers responsible for Telecommunications for two consecutive terms. In 2001, when the Labour party won for the second time, Mr. George was made the new Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. With his wealth of knowledge and experience in that field, he brought new perspective into that Ministry and sought to bring about a revival of the declining Banana Industry. He also directed his energies towards the development of a long term Agricultural Development Policy and provided strategic approaches to the revitalization of the Agricultural Industry. Unfortunately, after a cabinet reshuffle in early 2004 George was transferred from Agriculture to the new Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security, a ministry that embraces the Police, Prison and Immigration. Mr. George has served on the board of a number of professional, as well as non professional organizations, such as the National Commission for UNESCO, Technical Advisory Committee of the OECS Agricultural Diversification Unit, the Caribbean Food Crops Society and International Root Crop Society, Chief negotiator, OECS Telecommunications Reform; Member - Board of Governors, CARDI; Chairman - Board of Governors, CARDI; Panel member, Agricultural Science Panel CXC, Commissioner - Land Reform Commission, St. Lucia; St. Lucia Civil Service Association just to name a few.",

The luncheon took place on Wednesday, June 14th, 12pm-2pm at Beaches Turks & Caicos Resort Village and Spa, Key West Village. The luncheon brought together 50 attendees, including members of Government, MSMEs in the agricultural sector, representatives from major resorts, and the business community to hear from the Ministry of Agriculture and special guest speaker, Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina; President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) on the topic of food security. In her address to the attendees, the Honourable Josephine Connolly, Minister of Agriculture, stated, “We have clear goals to achieve a level of food security as articulated in our Plan for Empowerment of our people. Our focus is on creating a strong, sustainable sector that would empower social development through, among other things, increased local food production. We have a thriving fishing industry, and our goals for sustainability, food production, and meeting growing local demands are the same in this industry. Guest Speaker Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the AfDB, shared his view and lessons for the Caribbean from the AfDB’s experiences on food security during the luncheon. Dr. Adesina highlighted that in both the Caribbean and Africa, the negative impacts of climate change are felt in the agricultural sector and this, combined with looming shortages prompted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, threatens food security. He elaborated on the Bank’s use of technologies in the African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) programme and its role in helping to deliver climate smart seeds to farmers in several African countries and in so doing, these countries have been able to get ahead of current wheat shortages. Under the TAAT programme, Sudan reduced wheat importation by 50% in two years, while Ethiopia was able to cut wheat imports altogether. The AfDB also recently approved the $1.5 billion African Emergency Food Production Facility to help advance food security in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Dr. Adesina stated, “We all agreed it is time to support Africa to produce its food. It is time to have food sovereignty. The same must apply to the Caribbean. A recent survey by CARICOM and the World Food Program shows that food insecurity has increased by 72% among the population of the English speaking Caribbean countries,” said Dr. Adesina. “Food aid cannot feed Africa. Food aid cannot feed the Caribbean. Africa and the Caribbean need seeds in the ground and mechanical harvesters to harvest bountiful food produced locally,” he stressed. Commenting on the event, CEO of Invest TCI Angela Musgrove noted, “The conversation on collaborating for capacity development to establish and maintain food security partnerships is not just an imperative but long overdue. Invest TCI was pleased to bring our small businesses to the table to be a part of the dialogue. As stakeholders, each of us has a role to play as we recognize the urgency for developing and transforming the agriculture sector in the Turks and Caicos to a level of self-sufficiency. My optimistic view is that it is not an impossible feat but one that can only be achieved if the energy created by each of us is channeled into making a collective impact for all of us.”\nInvest TCI would like to thank its partners Digicel, The Office of the Premier, and the CDB for collaborating on this very important initiative.

            "passage": "When giants pass from this life, it is not enough to lament and bemoan what has been lost. Even as we grieve their passing, we should stop to examine the lives of these great men and women and extract lessons that will help us to make the most of the time we have left. Captain Horace Burrell, affectionately called ‘Cappo’, was a leader, a patriot, a military man, a father, a family man, an entrepreneur, businessman and diplomat. He died at 67 years old, but managed to accomplish many great things in the time that he spent on planet Earth. There is much to learn from his approach to leadership, business and life. Here are 10 lessons we extracted from his very full life. 1. Be the leader. Anyone who worked with the Captain will tell you that he rose to the occasion of leadership as often as it became necessary. He was in charge of the Jamaica Defence Force’s football team, president of the Bakers’ Association of Jamaica, vice-president of the Caribbean Football Union, chairman of CONCACAF’s disciplinary committee, president of the Jamaica Football Federation and Football Foundation of Jamaica, vice-president of the Jamaica Olympic Association … the list is impressive. There’s a lesson there for us: do not be afraid to lead. If you see the need, if you know you have what it takes to get the job done and make a positive impact, don’t shy away from the task. Step forward with boldness and grace … and be the leader. 2. Serve your country. ‘The President’, as he was sometimes called, demonstrated his love for his country through his service to it. He was a military man, and gave over 10 years of service before retiring to pursue other interests. As a successful businessman (founder and CEO of The Captain’s Bakery and The Captain’s Aviation Services), he gave back by sponsoring many local sporting events. He also lent his administrative expertise to the growth and development of Jamaican football without reservation. He served Jamaica, and he did it well. 3. Pursue multiple passions with excellence. The Captain was a military man, a baker, a businessman, and a sports enthusiast. He rose to great heights in all of these fields. It shows that it is possible to successfully pursue more than one passions. But what is the key? Bringing a consistent set of values to the table – being and pursuing excellence in all things. The Captain demonstrated this in every field he became involved in. His consistent excellence enabled him to repeatedly win confidence and attain success. 4. Build for the long term. Many credit The Captain with laying the foundation for successful football administration in Jamaica. He didn’t just build to meet the JFF’s short term needs, but rather ensured that the organisational premise was laid for continuity many years hence. Today, the JFF has an organisational structure that enables its smooth oversight on a large-scale national level, and smooth operation on a small-scale parish level. That’s long-term thinking. 5. Plan for the short term. A popular example? The tremendous amount of forethought and planning that went into Jamaica’s pursuit of qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup Finals. After he was elected president of the JFF, The Captain initiated the Football Foundation of Jamaica with the aim of gathering the financial and technical support required to ensure that the country was immediately equipped to qualify for FIFA games that would take place four years later. 6. Don’t be afraid to be unpopular. Don’t be afraid to do what is necesssary, or make the tough decisions as a leader. In The Captain’s own words shortly after being elected president of the JFF: “As a leader, one cannot be afraid to make decisions, even if it means being unpopular; there will be no room for incompetence.”\n7. Be decisive. be firm and clear on your values, and then be decisive in your actions. As the Captain made clear when running the JFF: “Anyone failing to perform effectively, efficiently or scrupulously, I would have no hesitation in removing that individual immediately.”\n8. Ignore the naysayers. There will be detractors and naysayers for any endeavour you undertake in life. There will always be those people who try to impede your progress. Sometimes, it is best to ignore these naysayers and run with the vision you know you have. The Captain served in the JFF for many years.",

I was loathing taking economics, but Dr. Broder showed me that economics can help us address real problems, ones that I saw in my rural, predominately African American community. In a later class, with the enthusiasm for economics I learned in my introductory class, I wrote a paper on the determinants of teen pregnancy in rural Georgia. With Dr. Broder’s support I presented that work in the Student Section of the AAEA, my first professional meeting. His early intervention, engagement, and mentoring led me to this profession. Why did you join AAEA, and how has membership in the Association impacted your professional development? Early on I learned that engagement in the AAEA is vital to career success, but I stayed connected to the AAEA because of mentors like Dr. Ralph Christy and Dr. Daniel Sumner who encouraged me professionally and personally. I do not believe that I would be a full professor if I had not continued with the AAEA. What advice would you give to an up and coming Agricultural\/Applied Economist? Connect with other good researchers. Support your colleagues and pull for the good of the whole. Read broadly and engage scholars beyond economics. Take risks. Don’t forget you did not get here on your own. Live in equanimity.",

            "passage": "“Our department continues to watch our alumni reach new successes and positively impact the world, and I am proud that Mr. Vitelli has received the Outstanding Young Alumni award for his achievements in higher education.”\nStory by AEC\nPhotos provided by Kati Lawson\nFor Kati Lawson, the Department of Agricultural Education and Communication (AEC) has been closely woven into her life, but there is a common thread that seems to pull everything together: mentorship. As a high school student from Okeechobee, Florida, Lawson was bound and determined to attend Flagler College in Saint Augustine. Yet, her parents, with other intentions, carefully persuaded her to tour the University of Florida (UF). It was on this tour that Lawson met an individual that today she regards as a close mentor. His name was Dr. Ricky Telg, and he still works as a teacher, researcher, adviser and mentor for many in AEC today. It was the interaction that Lawson and Telg had that guided her to redefine her dream and attend UF for her undergraduate degree. “I actually chose AEC because of Dr. Telg,” said Lawson. “Basically, I wanted to take any classes he was teaching.”\nShe found both Telg’s mentorship and expertise invaluable as she considered her future career in journalism. With yet another unexpected turn, Lawson found herself moving back to Okeechobee for a career in teaching, a profession she fell in love with while educating fifth grade at her local elementary school. She let this newly discovered passion guide her to pursue and obtain a master’s degree from Angelo State University, where she studied education in guidance and counseling. Telg’s mentorship travels with many of his students, Lawson included, far beyond commencement. One of the ways he does so is by sending out current job postings to his former students. One such email called Lawson’s attention to a posting for a lecturer in AEC, housed in the UF\/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at Plant City. While Lawson was intrigued, her first move wasn’t to edit her résumé and draft a cover letter. Instead, she gave her mentor a call. At the time, Lawson was working as a College and Career Counselor at a local high school, but getting back into the classroom and reconnecting with AEC was especially appealing. It turns out, that phone call with Telg was the push she needed. Today, Lawson can be found teaching AEC undergraduate students in Plant City, specializing in the communication and leadership development classes. She strives to teach her students in the same way she was taught. “Dr. Telg’s biggest strength is that he teaches to the student and not just the curriculum,” she said. “He doesn’t teach all his students the same, but he treats them all fairly.”\nLawson hopes that she can serve as just as much of a mentor and resource for her students in Plant City as she had during her undergraduate career. “Plant City is unique because I am able to work directly with local industry professionals and then tailor the curriculum to fit local needs,” Lawson said. “I know my students are gaining valuable skills that make them especially equipped to enter the workforce right her in their community.”\nThose industry relationships also help her connect students with potential career opportunities upon graduation, just like Telg does for his students, Lawson included. Kati is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in AEC, specializing in agricultural communication of course, under the continued leadership and support of her mentor and friend, Dr. Ricky Telg. Guest Blog by Heather Ryan\nPhotos provided by Heather Ryan\n“Our partisan divide exists only between the engaged and the apathetic.” This statement was powerfully spoken at a pivotal chapter of my early collegiate career. These words have since served as the pillar foundation for each of my experiences as an undergraduate student in the department of Agricultural Education & Communication (AEC) at the University of Florida (UF). Leadership, public service, and community development have been the central themes of my extracurricular pursuits that allow me to mobilize diverse people groups together not only on campus, but throughout the surrounding Gainesville community as a collective. Thanks to the support offered through the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, I have shared the privilege and joy of serving as 1 of 4 students in the year-long fellowship program downtown at City Hall. Our roles span across a widespread set of skills and disciplines including visual design, urban planning, and policy research.",

            "passage": "It's the economy\nAs Jamaica welcomes 2015 today, business, civic and religious leaders have acknowledged that issues related to the economy had the greatest impact on the nation over the past year. Jamaica's performance under the $1.2-billion economic programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been listed as the top item to be celebrated. The islandwide outbreak of the chikungunya virus (chik-V), the 18 per cent reduction in murders and the West Kingston Commission of Enquiry rounded out the four things sector leaders said had a major impact on Jamaican life in 2014. For Jamaica Manufacturers' Association President Brian Pengelley, the implementation of the IMF programme and the willingness of all stakeholders to stay the course made it an easy call. \"If we hadn't done that, we would have been in very big trouble. It's a very simple reason,\" Pengelley emphasised. While noting the adverse impact on public-sector employees, Oneil Grant, president of the Jamaica Civil Service Association, agreed, saying Jamaicans would have been worse off if the country did not meet the conditions laid out by the IMF as well as contain expenses. \"The sacrifices made by all of the partners would have come to naught if we were not able to achieve those,\" Grant argued. Last year, Jamaica passed all\nthree IMF tests - six dating back to the last financial year. This means the country met all the quantitative targets set by the US-based lending institution. However, for Dennis Chung, executive director of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica and Erica Wynter, president of the Young Entrepreneurs Association, the lost man-hours caused by the chik-V outbreak had a greater impact. \"The one that might have had the biggest impact was the chikungunya in terms of a one-time incident,\" he told The Gleaner yesterday. Wynter went further, asserting that the chik-V outbreak left many businesses, especially the smaller ones, devastated. \"Imagine you as a small business owner with a staff complement of five persons and you had sometimes four or five persons out because of chik-V. I think it affected us more than the larger entities because they would have the resources to bounce back easily; we do not,\" she explained. The Reverend Karl Johnson, general secretary of the Jamaica Baptist Union, said the reduction in the number of persons killed this year \"has to be something to celebrate\". \"It is all tied up, for me, in the fact that I believe one of the great challenges of our beloved country is to develop and sustain a wholesome ethic of life,\" Johnson argued. But Donovan Walker, president of the Jamaican Bar Association, believes the West Kingston Commission of Enquiry could turn out to be a watershed moment for Jamaica. According to him, if the enquiry is conducted properly, the nation could start getting answers to one of the \"greatest massacres of Jamaican citizens since the Morant Bay rebellion\". \"We really do need, as a country, to have answers to those questions. So what is important is that the enquiry is conducted, not for political gain, not for sound bites, but to get to the heart of what caused it and preventing this from ever happening again,\" he said of the enquiry into the 2010 police-military operations in the west Kingston community of Tivoli Gardens. Walker said what will be interesting is to see how the Government responds to the findings of the commission.",

            "passage": "One of the things that I found most inspiring about the week was meeting the scholars from around the world and hearing their stories. It has started the process of opening my eyes to agriculture in other countries and their issues but also to how the agriculture industry fits into communities around the world. The range of speakers throughout the week was excellent and I think they really highlighted some of the strengths of New Zealand and the New Zealand culture. It also increased my understanding of our country and different rural industries within which I have not had much to do with in the past such as the mining industry. I thought the Friday session with Richard was fantastic as it emphasised the importance of the integrity of the work carried out and the standard of research that is required. I think that it also helped everyone to really think about how their individual project and how the results from this could be of benefit to the community and industry. It made us all think about what our role as a leader in our community and how not only the research itself but the skills developed can be used to help our local community and the greater industry. It was great to hear how people‟s topics have been moulded due to the discussions that had occurred throughout the week. Not only did the CSC provide inspiration and enthusiasm but also fantastic contacts. The conference enabled contacts to be made globally and friendships to be forged. I know that having met these scholars I feel a lot more comfortable contacting not only scholars from my year but also past scholars whilst travelling around the world. It has also enforced the \"Nuffield family\" concept which I have heard so much about. I left the CSC inspired and full of enthusiasm to get underway with my research. It has helped me to clarify my project and I have made some fantastic friendships in the process. I feel very honoured to have been selected for this opportunity and know that I have a life-changing year ahead! Speakers at the 2011 CSC were:\n- Milton Suzuki. Bayer CropScience Brazilian agriculture development in a global perspective (8.3 MB Powerpoint file)\n- Hayley Moynihan. Rabobank Global agribusiness outlook –higher prices and greater volatility to reign? (1.1 MB PDF file)\n- Dr. David Hughes. Emeritus Professor of Food Marketing \"Story Food\" versus \"Feeding the Family Food\": Different strokes for different folks (7.0 MB Powerpoint file)\n- Alistair Polsen. Special Agricultural Trade Envoy, NZ\n- James Su Hao. GM and Director, East Rock Limited, China\n- Todd McLay MP\n- John Allen CEO MFAT\n- Professor Jacqueline Rowarth\n- Hon. David Carter\n- Peter Yealands\n- Dick Davison\n- Penny Mossman. Acting Principal, Amuri Area School\n- Norm Williamson. Chairman Amuri Irrigation\n- Steve Sterne. Patoa Farms\n- John Palmer\n- Richard Higham\n- Andrew & Anne-Mary Benton\n- Sam Johnson\n- Eugenie Sage\n- Mark Pizey\n- Gareth Thomas\n- Jo Stratford\n- Paul Thomas\n- Peter O'Sullivan\nA personal perspective of the 2011 conference by Nuffield Ireland Scholar, Amii Cahill\nBefore leaving home for the 2011 Nuffield Contemporary Scholars Conference in New Zealand, we were sent each scholar's profile and it was hard to imagine how individuals involved in such diverse agricultural enterprises, in terms of both product and scale, would have much in common. However, it soon transpired that the issues impacting on many of us are similar across our businesses. Day one involved all scholars giving a brief presentation on themselves and their area of study, followed by an exercise to understand each other's communities. This clearly showed that, although our communities are very different, the issues affecting them are very comparable. In my opinion this type of interaction was when we as a group benefitted most from the trip. Despite a lack of sleep being a common issue throughout the week, I feel the varied range of speakers managed to cater for the interest of all scholars. As the group originated from all corners of the globe, there was of course an element of 'the same but different' thrown into discussions. Some items that caused a level of disagreement between attendees included GE (Genetically Enhanced) products, although ultimately agreement was reached on the need for a balanced and scientific approach to such technologies. Another related to the pros and cons of farming on a large scale. I did hear that old adage mentioned 'it's not size that matters, it's what you do with it', but I will leave you to draw your own conclusions on the origin of the statement.",

            "passage": "Addendum: Personal Impact & Testimonies\nRichard placed enormous emphasis on the need for informed collaboration in order to achieve meaningful change. As mentioned in the paper, he wrote in his introduction to the second edition of The Growth Illusion of the need for a “substantial number of people” to accept the necessity move beyond a growth-based economy, in order for a “new path for humanity” to be able to open up. He was also strikingly lacking in arrogance, to the extent that he frequently did not claim credit for his own work. One of the last pieces of writing he contributed to, a paper for the Irish electricity supply board entitled “Aggressive Mutuality,” was not even signed by him. A tribute to him on the Feasta website, by a group in Waterford, describes how when he was invited to give a talk there he used public transport and stayed in budget accommodation (in marked contrast to a ‘celebrity’ economist who insisted on red-carpet treatment). In this author’s view, this attitude affected the whole ethos of Feasta in a profound way. His impact was impressively wide, cutting across many professional boundaries. In preparing this paper we sent out a request to people who knew Richard asking for information about his impact on their lives. Below is a brief sample of quotes from some of the replies we received, along with quotes from some previously existing commentary on Richard’s impact. You can read still more tributes to Richard from around the world, including China and India, on his memorial page. David Korten, the US-based author of When Corporations Rule the World and founder of Yes magazine, wrote in 2000 that Richard “has more effectively than anyone else in my experience challenged the orthodox view that economic growth is essential to eliminating poverty and improving the quality of life for all”. He added that his debt to Richard is “considerable”. Mark Garavan, the current chair of Feasta’s board of directors, did research on Feasta’s role as an Irish NGO in the early 2000s which included extensive input from Richard. As mentioned above he saw Feasta, under the leadership of Richard, as taking a new approach to environmental activism, going beyond the traditional dichotomy of protest versus co-option by the powerful: “In Feasta, not only might activism have moved beyond protest, but environmental politics may also have moved beyond the political arena as traditionally conceived.”\nAnne Ryan, a lecturer in adult education at Maynooth university in Ireland and Feasta trustee, mentioned in her commentary to us that “his works are widely cited and drawn on by scholars and activists in the field of sustainability, resilience and social justice.” She describes him as “an intellectual cornerstone of the environmental movement in Ireland and a model independent public intellectual and activist.”\nAlso in academia, Tina Evans, a professor in sustainability studies in Colorado, commented that “He was well ahead of his time. Actually, he was right where we all need to be in our thinking about issues of sustainability and economy, but most people are not there yet.” She uses his work extensively in her lecturing. Rob Hopkins, a prominent campaigner in the Transition Towns movement and author of The Transition Handbook, commented in a video made for Feasta that “I was really honoured to live in Ireland during the time that Feasta started and to see how it emerged under the compassionate, committed and visionary leadership that the late, much missed and very dear Richard Douthwaite brought to the whole thing.”\nBarbara Panvel, co-ordinator of the New Era Network that is active in Britain and India, described Richard as a ‘much valued member’ of the Network. David Hirst, an inventor and consultant in information technology, wrote that Richard’s was “a huge boost” to him in promoting his inventions concerning electricity and tariffs that could help the electricity system become more sustainable and renewable. Roy Johnston, a physicist and systems analyst, described how Richard’s economic thinking seems to him to provide a way beyond traditional Marxist analysis: “there is scope for development here in addressing the problem of how politically to make a transformation towards democratic ownership of the capital investment process”. He regrets not having had time to interact more with Richard during his lifetime. Phoebe Bright, a former trader at the London Stock Exchange, commented that “had I not read Richard’s book, had I not been bold enough to call him with a question and found a new friend, my life would have been much the poorer.",

Then, he would take me somewhere else. But, I\nwas just impressed by it, to be so welcomed. I had served on both the Louisiana\nPress and the Mississippi Press.

J: Well, we had at that time quite a few active publishers in north Florida, other\nsmall towns, and they had always traveled with the candidates, maybe, or\nsomething else in their county because that was the only big news you had. So,\nthe weeklies got closer to anybody than would the dailies. The dailies always\nhad one or two stories that nobody liked, or something like that. It was easy to\npiss on them, you know? All of sudden when I started writing editorials...I am not\nsaying I was the originator, but the British newspaper I guess had the idea best. You know, this was the end of the line for weekly papers and small people up\nand down the state, that never again would they have this kind of power. L: Because they reapportioned? L: They reapportioned according to population strength, rather than size, and gave\none person one vote. J: That was right.

    "text": "Bipolar, formerly known as manic depression, is characterized by mood dysregulation resulting in one or more episodes of abnormally increased energy level, mood, and cognition, that alternate with one or more depressive episodes. Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

    "answer": "No, it is not true that bipolar disorder is exclusively caused by brain chemistry issues. While imbalances in brain chemicals such as neurotransmitters may play a role in the development and symptoms of bipolar disorder, it is widely recognized that the disorder is likely caused by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Research suggests that bipolar disorder may involve abnormalities in brain structure and function, as well as disruptions in circadian rhythms and stress response systems. Additionally, life events, substance abuse, and other environmental factors can act as triggers for episodes of mania or depression. Therefore, treating bipolar disorder effectively often involves a combination of medication to help balance brain chemistry, psychotherapy to address psychological and emotional factors, and lifestyle changes to manage triggers and improve overall well-being.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: \"Can I see the test results, please?\" Let’s start with a true story. A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, \"Can I see the test results, please?\" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and \"the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication\". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, \"Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results\"1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders. What Counseling Strategies Work Well with Bipolar?\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.\n\nBipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.\n\nBack to Top\nIt’s in human nature to feel sadness. Every life is filled with ups and downs, tragedy and comedy, kindness and cruelty. It is a part and parcel of who we are and an important part of our journey. But for some people, the struggles often don’t end with the event that triggered the sadness. Nowadays, more and more people are suffering from depression and other mental ailments, at young ages also, and the explanation goes well beyond a singular circumstance, or an individual’s inability to be happy or find strength. In fact, most mental health problems that people face can be understood from a purely chemical standpoint. The brain is essentially the chemical factory of the body, producing all the hormones that keep our bodies growing and sending out all the messages to keep our limbs moving. So its only natural that in some cases, this factory might face some difficulties while doing its job. After all, we are only beings of flesh, blood and imperfection, not machines. But those imperfections are what give us the drive, the endurance and the passion to persevere against all odds and struggle even through the toughest of times. That, and television. With that brief moment of levity over, let’s get back to the topic at hand. What are some of the mental health problems that are now becoming more and more commonplace? Well, there’s depression. We already covered that. There are various types of depression as well. One of the more severe ailments that some people face is Bipolar Disorder, usually marked by intense and often uncontrollable periodic mood swings and personality shifts. Anxiety and frequent panic attacks can also be extremely disruptive, and can affect a person’s ability to function normally and interact with other people. There are also a large number of people world over who suffer from memory loss, both long and short term, which can also be caused by an irregular production of chemicals in the brain (when not caused by head injuries or drugs, pharmaceutical and other). Even addiction has been linked to irregular brain chemistry. These problems can affect people of all ages, races, geographies and backgrounds. What Does Brain Chemistry Mean? So when we talk about brain chemistry, what chemicals are we talking about specifically? We are basically talking about hormones, and neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are the messengers of the body, letting the various organs know how the brain wants them to act, through nerve cells. These neurotransmitters can be huge determinants in our emotions. The following are a few of the main hormones our brains produce that affect our emotional state:\nThis hormone has a very important role to play as it is the communicator between neurons and nerve cells. It is also the chemical that controls our motor function and drive. Dopamine is the hormone that keeps you motivated, active and focused on the task at hand and the world around you. Needless to say, it is a very important neurotransmitter, and lower levels of dopamine can result in depression, fatigue and anxiety. High levels of dopamine, on the other hand, can result in addiction, largely because most addictive substances, from video games and coffee, to alcohol and narcotics, are usually designed to increase dopamine levels drastically. Also commonly known as the happy hormone, Serotonin is responsible for the joyful sensations we experience in life. Low levels of serotonin have been a major factor linked with depression. This is because problems can arise with respect to neuron inhibitors, that are in the brain to regulate the production of these hormones, and inhibit them where necessary. But in some cases, the production of serotonin can become too low as a result, which is why most anti-depressants are created with the intent to stop inhibitors from reducing the production of serotonin. This is the hormone that helps you sleep at night. It is produced by the pineal gland located in the center of the brain. Our sleep cycles in general are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a center in the hypothalamus that sends signals to other parts of the brain. On exposure to darkness, the pineal gland receives a signal from the SCN and begins to actively produce melatonin. As the melatonin levels in your blood stream increase, you steadily become drowsier. And the internal clock of the human body is usually pretty strict, as melatonin stays in the body normally from 9 pm to 9 am.\n\nBipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.\n\n2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac. In this state, a person may feel extreme highs and engage in risky .\n\nBipolar disorder usually begins in early adulthood, between eighteen and thirty years of age. The earlier symptoms appear, the more severe the illness tends to be. Bipolar disorder typically begins after a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or financial problems. Sometimes an illness, such as a physical injury or stroke, can trigger symptoms. Most people with bipolar disorder have at least one episode of depression, along with one or more episodes of mania. It’s important to seek treatment for bipolar disorder if you or someone you know has symptoms..\nWhat is the main cause of bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. It occurs in 1-2% of the general population. There is strong evidence that genes play a role in causing depression and bipolar disorder. Many genes are involved in how the brain works. Studies show that an abnormality in the genes that control the brain chemical serotonin may be responsible for bipolar disorder in many patients..\nWhy are females so bipolar? There are several reasons behind this question. Some of the factors include nature and nurture. Females have biologically programmed mood swings. This is because they have to carry the baby for nine months and therefore are more sensitive. Males, on the other hand, are more on the aggressive side. This is also because of the different hormones present in the brain. Again, nurture is an important factor. Society disapprove of men showing their emotions and so, through a series of upbringing, boys are made to hide their feelings. When the society encourages the opposite in girls, the difference in behavior is natural..\nWhat are the signs of bipolar in a woman? Hi , A woman who is suffering from bipolar disorder may show some of the following signs. -She may be in high spirits one moment and then her mood could suddenly change to being depressed. -She may not be able to sleep properly or at all. -She may be highly agitated, irritable and edgy. -She could have suicidal thoughts. And this list is not exhaustive. You may want to ask her to see a doctor..\nHow a person with bipolar thinks? The most significant feature of bipolar disorder is the presence of “mood episodes.” The symptoms of mania and depression can affect your ability to function normally. There are periods of time with completely normal moods in between episodes. It is difficult to predict when an episode will occur. Even if you have known the pattern of your symptoms in the past, it may change in the future..\nHow genetic is bipolar? It is important to remember that heredity only accounts for about 50% of the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder. There is no single gene responsible for the disorder, rather it appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.. Does Bipolar worsen with age? Bipolar disorder is not a normal part of aging. It is a mood disorder that occurs at any age. People with Bipolar disorder may experience periods of depression and periods of mania. Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and birth control pills are some common medications that help treat bipolar disorder..\nAre bipolar people smart? Bipolar people are often seen as moody, and many people think they are just lazy. But in truth, they have a very real, very serious illness called bipolar disorder. Bipolar people are often misunderstood, and they often suffer in silence. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It can be a devastating illness and if not treated, it can lead to the worst kind of f.\nDo bipolar people hear voices? Yes, they do. Bipolar people often hear voices. Often they hear not just one voice, but several different ones. This is what’s called “hearing voices”. People with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, as the symptoms of both disorders may be quite similar. However, there are some major differences between the two. People with schizophrenia hear voices that are not there, that are completely made up by the patient’s delusional mind. This difference is the reason why people with bipolar disorder are often prescribed antidepressants to treat their symptoms, rather than antipsychotics..\n\nWe all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.\n\n- Education and Science»\n- Psychology & Psychiatry\nA Light in the Dark: Breakthrough Insights on Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nIt is Time for a Global Reality Check! Since this author was a youngster, she closely studied biological, psychological conditions and profiling dysfunction such as mental disorder, abuse, addictions, domestic violence and criminal influences. For the entirety of her life, she has devoted significant efforts, study, observation to investigate the 'root causes' of such micro-psychological conditions that effectively manifest as more macro-sociological disorders in society and in our world. The culmination of this research and acute observances over the past 45 years is beginning to coalesce and certain insights can be gleaned that may offer treatment potential in intelligence and medical circles who may be equally invested in solving these mysteries of the mind and body. It is important to note, however, that there are certain parties that may not wish such mental conditions and disorders to be properly or effectively treated or even dare I say- cured. For there is significant employment, investments, systems, services, drugs and public policy that perpetually support it and parties who benefit from the generational cycles of illness, disease and disorder. It is true that psychiatric conditions or afflictions are the result of a combination of influences that are inherently genetic, environmental and causal. In fact, we currently all can suffer and be affected by biological and mental disorders. If you do not have a mental health condition of some sort, you may have a genetic predisposition to one and it is only a matter of a simple trigger be it an allergy, an infection, chemical exposure, a bacteria, a virus, a parasite or a trauma that can flick the switch on that gene and cause an expression or imbalance in your brain and body. If you have ever been ill, on antibiotics, vomited, overly fatigued, had lethargy, stressed, depressed, had stomach, intestinal or bowel issues, confusion or disorientation and insomnia or anxiety, sexual dysfunction or wasn't able to cope, you have experienced effects of a mental or a brain illness and most likely a biological infection. What many do not understand is that any affliction of the brain affects the body or vice versa. I must emphasize that the mind body and nuclear soul symbiotic health of a biological, psychological and neurological connected system is paramount to overall physical and mental health and well being. Few understand or treat the 'whole' organism. And that is what you are is..a complex organization of sybmbiotic cellular living bodies within an organism. And we as organisms are a macro-biological organizational system on this living planet we call, Mother Earth. Now I must comment that some organisms or persons' actions are more conducive to health while some are more conducive to disease while others are indifferent or ignorant. You do have a choice to be one of the above, in fact it is each and every person's responsibility to be a healthier organism and prevent disease and transmission with self-care and due diligence. I must express my frustration at the lack of personal self-care in western countries and the over use of biological warfare between nations that excessively exasperate and compound the issue causing pandemics leading to cycles of infections, the resurgence of diseases and social disorder that costs trillions in treatment, disable societies, judicial systems and medical services. There have been outright abuses and crimes by individuals, groups, corporations and nations using nuclear fusion of caustic and poisonous chemicals into items, crops, the food cycle and natural diets calling it voodoo, franken nutrition, treatment or witchcraft. But that is another article...let's get to the root causes. Schizophrenia is a genetic disease, cellular and mental disorder previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Go figure, they keep changing the disorder descriptions and renaming illnesses in the DSM manual of psychiatric disorders simply to confuse everyone. It is a disease of dysfunctional cellular processes that originates in the left side of the brain responsible for the most basic of logic, scientific thought, math, computations, memorization, recall and controls the right side of the body. This criss cross control functionality of the brain is referred to as X by some.\n\nQuestion:Is it true that bipolar disorder is exclusively caused by brain chemistry issues?",
    "passages": [
        {
            "passage": "\"Can I see the test results, please?\" Let’s start with a true story. A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, \"Can I see the test results, please?\" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and \"the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication\". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, \"Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results\"1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.",

            "passage": "Have you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders.

            "passage": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.",

At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.",

            "passage": "Back to Top\nIt’s in human nature to feel sadness. Every life is filled with ups and downs, tragedy and comedy, kindness and cruelty. It is a part and parcel of who we are and an important part of our journey. But for some people, the struggles often don’t end with the event that triggered the sadness. Nowadays, more and more people are suffering from depression and other mental ailments, at young ages also, and the explanation goes well beyond a singular circumstance, or an individual’s inability to be happy or find strength. In fact, most mental health problems that people face can be understood from a purely chemical standpoint. The brain is essentially the chemical factory of the body, producing all the hormones that keep our bodies growing and sending out all the messages to keep our limbs moving. So its only natural that in some cases, this factory might face some difficulties while doing its job. After all, we are only beings of flesh, blood and imperfection, not machines. But those imperfections are what give us the drive, the endurance and the passion to persevere against all odds and struggle even through the toughest of times. That, and television. With that brief moment of levity over, let’s get back to the topic at hand. What are some of the mental health problems that are now becoming more and more commonplace? Well, there’s depression. We already covered that. There are various types of depression as well. One of the more severe ailments that some people face is Bipolar Disorder, usually marked by intense and often uncontrollable periodic mood swings and personality shifts. Anxiety and frequent panic attacks can also be extremely disruptive, and can affect a person’s ability to function normally and interact with other people. There are also a large number of people world over who suffer from memory loss, both long and short term, which can also be caused by an irregular production of chemicals in the brain (when not caused by head injuries or drugs, pharmaceutical and other). Even addiction has been linked to irregular brain chemistry. These problems can affect people of all ages, races, geographies and backgrounds. What Does Brain Chemistry Mean? So when we talk about brain chemistry, what chemicals are we talking about specifically? We are basically talking about hormones, and neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are the messengers of the body, letting the various organs know how the brain wants them to act, through nerve cells. These neurotransmitters can be huge determinants in our emotions. The following are a few of the main hormones our brains produce that affect our emotional state:\nThis hormone has a very important role to play as it is the communicator between neurons and nerve cells. It is also the chemical that controls our motor function and drive. Dopamine is the hormone that keeps you motivated, active and focused on the task at hand and the world around you. Needless to say, it is a very important neurotransmitter, and lower levels of dopamine can result in depression, fatigue and anxiety. High levels of dopamine, on the other hand, can result in addiction, largely because most addictive substances, from video games and coffee, to alcohol and narcotics, are usually designed to increase dopamine levels drastically. Also commonly known as the happy hormone, Serotonin is responsible for the joyful sensations we experience in life. Low levels of serotonin have been a major factor linked with depression. This is because problems can arise with respect to neuron inhibitors, that are in the brain to regulate the production of these hormones, and inhibit them where necessary. But in some cases, the production of serotonin can become too low as a result, which is why most anti-depressants are created with the intent to stop inhibitors from reducing the production of serotonin. This is the hormone that helps you sleep at night. It is produced by the pineal gland located in the center of the brain. Our sleep cycles in general are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a center in the hypothalamus that sends signals to other parts of the brain. On exposure to darkness, the pineal gland receives a signal from the SCN and begins to actively produce melatonin. As the melatonin levels in your blood stream increase, you steadily become drowsier. And the internal clock of the human body is usually pretty strict, as melatonin stays in the body normally from 9 pm to 9 am.",

            "passage": "Bipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.",

Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac. In this state, a person may feel extreme highs and engage in risky .",

It’s important to seek treatment for bipolar disorder if you or someone you know has symptoms..\nWhat is the main cause of bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. It occurs in 1-2% of the general population. There is strong evidence that genes play a role in causing depression and bipolar disorder. Many genes are involved in how the brain works. Studies show that an abnormality in the genes that control the brain chemical serotonin may be responsible for bipolar disorder in many patients..\nWhy are females so bipolar? There are several reasons behind this question. Some of the factors include nature and nurture. Females have biologically programmed mood swings. This is because they have to carry the baby for nine months and therefore are more sensitive. Males, on the other hand, are more on the aggressive side. This is also because of the different hormones present in the brain. Again, nurture is an important factor.

Hi , A woman who is suffering from bipolar disorder may show some of the following signs. -She may be in high spirits one moment and then her mood could suddenly change to being depressed. -She may not be able to sleep properly or at all. -She may be highly agitated, irritable and edgy. -She could have suicidal thoughts. And this list is not exhaustive. You may want to ask her to see a doctor..\nHow a person with bipolar thinks? The most significant feature of bipolar disorder is the presence of “mood episodes.” The symptoms of mania and depression can affect your ability to function normally. There are periods of time with completely normal moods in between episodes. It is difficult to predict when an episode will occur. Even if you have known the pattern of your symptoms in the past, it may change in the future..\nHow genetic is bipolar? It is important to remember that heredity only accounts for about 50% of the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder. There is no single gene responsible for the disorder, rather it appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.. Does Bipolar worsen with age? Bipolar disorder is not a normal part of aging. It is a mood disorder that occurs at any age. People with Bipolar disorder may experience periods of depression and periods of mania. Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and birth control pills are some common medications that help treat bipolar disorder..\nAre bipolar people smart? Bipolar people are often seen as moody, and many people think they are just lazy. But in truth, they have a very real, very serious illness called bipolar disorder. Bipolar people are often misunderstood, and they often suffer in silence. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It can be a devastating illness and if not treated, it can lead to the worst kind of f.\nDo bipolar people hear voices? Yes, they do. Bipolar people often hear voices. Often they hear not just one voice, but several different ones. This is what’s called “hearing voices”. People with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, as the symptoms of both disorders may be quite similar. However, there are some major differences between the two. People with schizophrenia hear voices that are not there, that are completely made up by the patient’s delusional mind. This difference is the reason why people with bipolar disorder are often prescribed antidepressants to treat their symptoms, rather than antipsychotics..",

            "passage": "We all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.",

            "passage": "- Education and Science»\n- Psychology & Psychiatry\nA Light in the Dark: Breakthrough Insights on Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nIt is Time for a Global Reality Check! Since this author was a youngster, she closely studied biological, psychological conditions and profiling dysfunction such as mental disorder, abuse, addictions, domestic violence and criminal influences. For the entirety of her life, she has devoted significant efforts, study, observation to investigate the 'root causes' of such micro-psychological conditions that effectively manifest as more macro-sociological disorders in society and in our world. The culmination of this research and acute observances over the past 45 years is beginning to coalesce and certain insights can be gleaned that may offer treatment potential in intelligence and medical circles who may be equally invested in solving these mysteries of the mind and body. It is important to note, however, that there are certain parties that may not wish such mental conditions and disorders to be properly or effectively treated or even dare I say- cured. For there is significant employment, investments, systems, services, drugs and public policy that perpetually support it and parties who benefit from the generational cycles of illness, disease and disorder. It is true that psychiatric conditions or afflictions are the result of a combination of influences that are inherently genetic, environmental and causal. In fact, we currently all can suffer and be affected by biological and mental disorders. If you do not have a mental health condition of some sort, you may have a genetic predisposition to one and it is only a matter of a simple trigger be it an allergy, an infection, chemical exposure, a bacteria, a virus, a parasite or a trauma that can flick the switch on that gene and cause an expression or imbalance in your brain and body. If you have ever been ill, on antibiotics, vomited, overly fatigued, had lethargy, stressed, depressed, had stomach, intestinal or bowel issues, confusion or disorientation and insomnia or anxiety, sexual dysfunction or wasn't able to cope, you have experienced effects of a mental or a brain illness and most likely a biological infection. What many do not understand is that any affliction of the brain affects the body or vice versa. I must emphasize that the mind body and nuclear soul symbiotic health of a biological, psychological and neurological connected system is paramount to overall physical and mental health and well being. Few understand or treat the 'whole' organism. And that is what you are is..a complex organization of sybmbiotic cellular living bodies within an organism. And we as organisms are a macro-biological organizational system on this living planet we call, Mother Earth. Now I must comment that some organisms or persons' actions are more conducive to health while some are more conducive to disease while others are indifferent or ignorant. You do have a choice to be one of the above, in fact it is each and every person's responsibility to be a healthier organism and prevent disease and transmission with self-care and due diligence. I must express my frustration at the lack of personal self-care in western countries and the over use of biological warfare between nations that excessively exasperate and compound the issue causing pandemics leading to cycles of infections, the resurgence of diseases and social disorder that costs trillions in treatment, disable societies, judicial systems and medical services. There have been outright abuses and crimes by individuals, groups, corporations and nations using nuclear fusion of caustic and poisonous chemicals into items, crops, the food cycle and natural diets calling it voodoo, franken nutrition, treatment or witchcraft. But that is another article...let's get to the root causes. Schizophrenia is a genetic disease, cellular and mental disorder previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Go figure, they keep changing the disorder descriptions and renaming illnesses in the DSM manual of psychiatric disorders simply to confuse everyone. It is a disease of dysfunctional cellular processes that originates in the left side of the brain responsible for the most basic of logic, scientific thought, math, computations, memorization, recall and controls the right side of the body. This criss cross control functionality of the brain is referred to as X by some.",

UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.\n\nWFP APPEALS FOR FUNDS FOR DEMINING AND ROAD REPAIRS IN SOUTH SUDAN\nNAIROBI -WFP today appealed for urgent funding for road repairs and demining of key transport routes in southern Sudan to help people return after decades of war, and connect the region to northern Sudan and neighbouring countries. WFP said it faced an immediate shortfall of US$4.8 million in 2004 for the first phase and would need US$64 million for a special operation in 2005. It said funds for 2005 are needed as soon as possible because work should be done as much as possible during the dry season from October 2004 to May 2005. \"Investment in infrastructure is crucial to getting southern Sudan on its long-awaited road to recovery after decades of conflict. It is also urgent because between 600,000 and 1.2 million people are expected to return after the signing of a final peace agreement for the south,\" said Barbara van Logchem, WFP Project Manager for the Special Operation. \"These roads are the arteries to attract people back to the south. Delayed funding now means less opportunity for repairs during the dry season, which in turn means no visible peace dividend. This also delays economic growth and resettlement for people desperate for a new beginning,\" she added. The Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement\/Army (SPLM\/A) are expected to sign a final peace agreement covering the south by the end of December. South Sudan covers 650,000 square kilometers -- the size of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi combined. Yet the total road network is only 7,500 kilometres of main roads, most of which are unusable at least for part of the year, plus 10,000 kilometres of key feeder roads. None are tarmac except for a few kilometers in Juba town. WFP's Special Road Operation aims to facilitate the return and resettlement of people while providing visual, tangible peace dividends and contributing to conflict prevention. Better roads also stimulate economic growth through increased transportation and trade. With roads linked to the River Nile, the cost of food production and delivery will be reduced while farmers' access to markets will grow. In addition, the delivery costs of food aid will decrease and eventually the need for large quantities of aid to support people in southern Sudan should diminish. The first phase of WFP road repairs and demining ran from January until October this year, budgeted at US$21 million. It included the repair of three main routes: the Western Corridor linking south Sudan to Uganda, the Eastern Corridor linking the south to Kenya and a dyke\/road project in Bor County to mitigate flooding from the Nile, improve food security and start opening up access to the north. Already, daily bus services have started from Uganda into Sudan and up to the town of Yei and more types of vehicles are using the road, allowing small entrepreneurs to use pickups. Transport rates have dropped and prices of basic items such as maize, soap, sugar, soap and fuel have decreased by 20 percent in Yei since the beginning of the year. The second phase, covered by the Special Operation, aims to demine and repair eight additional routes for a total distance of 1,600 kilometres. Implementation of the second phase, which could have started in October 2004 was delayed to January 2005 because of a lack of funding. The WFP Special Operation activities were identified as an urgent need by the SPLM at the Oslo donor meeting in September 2004. Work can commence as soon as funding is made available. The project will ensure an immediate and visible impact on the ground. To date, WFP's road repair and demining in southern Sudan since January this year has received contributions from the United States (US$16.7 million), the Netherlands (US$3.3 million), Norway (US$1 million) and Italy (US$300,000). Note to Editors and Reporters Covering the Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World: video and photographs are available of road rehabilitation and demining in Sudan\nWFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency: in 2003 we gave food aid to a record 104 million people in 81 countries, including 56 million hungry children.

Two key elements will be covered under the project, namely a new multi lane highway connecting Kampala to the international airport in Entebbe and a branch route from Lweza to Munyonyo, a convention and resort centre at the shores of Lake Victoria. The second is of particular importance as visitors coming for meetings, conventions, conferences and large scale government meetings will upon completion be able to bypass the city entirely on their way from the airport to Munyonyo. The main section though, just over 51 kilometres long, will be operated as a toll road with users having to part with the shillings, worth though considering the time savings one can generate. The cost, estimated to be in the region of 450+ US Dollars, is financed by China – a Chinese construction company will carry out the work, similar in scope to the new super highway between Nairobi and Thika in Kenya – with the Ugandan government chipping in an estimated 100 million US Dollars to the overall cost. Like neighbouring Kenya, Uganda too has finally and almost belatedly woken to the reality that new roads, highways and bridges are key to future economic and social development. The planned construction of a new Nile bridge in Jinja is due to start in 2013, eventually connecting the new widened 4 lane highway planned between Kampala and Jinja and from Jinja to the border with Kenya in Malaba and Busia. This project is also thought to be in the final planning stages. Today though all eyes will be on the new Entebbe highway project, due to be completed within about three years time at which time us locals as well as our regular visitors will be able to take a collective breath of relief.\n\nThe Tanzania Roads Association (TARA), which is also a National Committee of the World Road Association (PIARC) under the Ministry of Works and Transport in Tanzania, in collaboration with the Tanzania Transportation Technology Transfer (TanT2 Centre), Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS), Tanzania Rural and Urban Roads Agency (TARURA), the International Road Federation (IRF) Geneva, the African Road Maintenance Funds Association (ARMFA), the Association of Southern Africa National Roads Agencies (ASANRA), and other local and international institutions, is organizing the Africa Regional Seminar on Performance-Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads to be held from 12th – 14th December 2022 at the Arusha International Conference Centre (AICC), Arusha Tanzania. The objective of the Regional Seminar is to raise awareness about the importance and benefits of performance-based contracts and framework agreements for roads, and facilitate the sharing of practitioners’ experiences and best practices. The Seminar will be conducted back to back with the Africa Regional Workshop on Performance- Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads. A three-day Regional Workshop, whose objective is to provide practitioners responsible for managing and maintaining road networks with sufficiently detailed tools, examples and practical knowledge for successfully implementing performance-based contracts and framework agreements for the roads for which they are responsible, will be held from 15th – 17th, December 2022. Only those participants who will attend the Africa Regional Seminar on Performance-Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads to be held at the Arusha International Conference Centre, Arusha, Tanzania, from 12th – 14th, December 2022, will be allowed to participate in the Africa Regional Workshop on Performance- Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads. What is a Performance Based Contract? The method of delivering road maintenance has progressively evolved. Historically, road agencies have moved from using in-house force account to traditional method-based maintenance contracting. Many countries are now heading towards performance-based contracting (PBC), an approach that has been deployed rapidly in the road sector in the past decade. However, while PBC offers a number of benefits for road agencies and road users, it is a relatively new approach and there are several aspects that need careful consideration to ensure that the goals of PBCs are fully achieved. Performance-based contracts (PBC) differ significantly from method-based contracts that have been traditionally used to maintain roads. PBC is a type of contract in which payments for the management and maintenance of road assets are explicitly linked to the contractor successfully meeting or exceeding certain clearly defined minimum performance indicators. Such contracts could potentially include management of infrastructures and activities such as road works, drainage system, pavements, traffic and roadside assets, bridges, tunnels, traffic services, and emergency response. In traditional method-based contracts, the road agency as a client normally specifies techniques, technologies, materials and quantities of materials to be used, together with the time during which the maintenance works should be executed. The payment to the contractor is based on the amount of inputs (e.g., cubic meters of asphalt concrete, number of working hours). In performance-based contracting the client does not specify any method or material requirements (provided the country’s standards are met). Instead the client specifies performance indicators that the contractor is required to meet when delivering maintenance services. According to the World Bank Standard Procurement Document for Output- and Performance-Based Road Contracts (2021),1 under the performance-based approach, the services to be provided by the Output- and Performance-Based Road Contract (OPBRC) is a form of PBC for which the World Bank has issued standard procurement documents. Contractor go much beyond the mere execution of pre-defined physical works. The Contract covers an array of activities needed to achieve and maintain a certain Service Level for road users, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance, as well as several activities related to the management (including periodic evaluation) of the road network under contract. It includes carrying out Rehabilitation Works, Improvement Works, as well as Emergency Works needed to reinstate the Roads after damage has occurred as a result of natural phenomena (such as strong storms, flooding and earthquakes). The PBC\/OPBRC competitive procurement process results in a contractual relationship where payments are made for measured outputs instead of the traditional way where the measurement and payment reflect the quantity of input. What is a Framework Agreement?\n\nFEC Approves N108 Billion for Road Projects in 4 States\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC), presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday in Abuja, approved N108 billion for the construction and rehabilitation of four road projects. The projects are in Adamawa, Borno, Enugu and Rivers states. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, stated this announced this while briefing State House correspondents on the outcome of the seventh virtual meeting of the council in Abuja. He said that council approved an augmentation of existing contract by N25 billion for the completion of the Lokponta section of the Enugu-Port Harcourt highway. “The ministry of works and housing presented two memoranda. “The first one was to aid the completion of the Lokponta section of the Enugu-Port Harcourt highway. “It was the augmentation of an existing contract by N25 billion and the council approved that augmentation,’’ Fashola said. The minister said the council also approved the award of three different roads. “The first is Dikwa-Marte-Monguno road for N60.273 billion and the Numan road linking Borno and Adamawa for N15.527 billion. “The third is for Gombi-Biu linking Adamawa and Borno also for N7.643 billion.’’\nFollow us on Twitter at @thesignalng\nCopyright 2020 SIGNAL.

USAID\/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID\/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID\/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID\/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment. Figure 1: Map of the Aceh Road Project\nContracts Start Date Finish Date Road Length Bridges Culverts Priority Oct 2006 Dec 2007 40 km 14 65 Prime Jun 2007 Feb 2010 104 km 17 128 Total 144 km 31 193 In November 2005, the OIG conducted an audit of USAID\/Indonesia’s Banda Aceh-Lamno road reconstruction activities implemented by WiKa for the priority road segments. 2 The OIG concluded that it could not determine whether all of the road reconstruction activities were on schedule to be completed by the overall project completion date and within the overall estimated costs because the Mission did not have an approved road design or an approved implementation plan in place. 2 OIG, Audit of USAID\/Indonesia’s Banda AcehLamno Road Reconstruction Activities Under Its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program , Report No. 5-497-06-003-P (Manila, Philippines: March 30, 2006)\nIn October 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review of USAID\/Indonesia’s road reconstruction project as part of its Congressionally mandated monitoring of U.S. reconstruction assistance to tsunami-affected countries. In its report, GAO concluded that USAID\/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID\/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID\/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities. OIG photograph of road construction near the Raba River bridge crossing at Km 25 in Aceh Province, Indonesia. (March 2007) AUDIT OBJECTIVE The Regional Inspector General\/Manila conducted this audit as part of its fiscal year 2007 annual audit plan to answer the following question: Is USAID\/Indonesia managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its • Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost? Appendix I contains a discussion of the audit’s scope and methodology. 3 GAO, Foreign Assistance USAID Signature Tsunami Reconstruction Efforts in Indonesia and Sri Lanka Exceed Initial Cost and Schedule Estimates, and Face Further Risks , GAO-07-357 (Washington, D.C.: February 28, 2007)\nAUDIT FINDINGS USAID\/Indonesia was managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost. While USAID\/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk. Nevertheless, these risk factorssome of which were beyond the Mission’s controlimpacted on the Aceh road project and caused delays.\n\nUganda is now looking at a November-December launch window for its revamped national carrier as it concludes funding negotiations for the first four aircraft. Speaking on the sidelines of a manifesto review event for the works sector on Wednesday, Monica Azuba Ntege, the minister for Works, told The EastAfrican that the government was concluding export finance negotiations for four Canadair Regional Jets 900 series (CRJ-900) that will form the backbone of an eventual fleet of six aircraft. “We have made some deposits on the aircraft and we are negotiating export finance for them with Canadian financiers. We expect that source to fund 70-80 per cent of the value of that acquisition while we fund the remainder from other sources,” she said. Parallel negotiations, although of lesser urgency, are ongoing with a consortium of Germany, French and British banks to advance export credit for a pair of Airbus A330-800 series that will form the core of the long distance fleet. Ms Azuba said that the government was exploring a mix of finance options and could borrow from other sources in the interim to bridge any funding gaps. The Minister said that $1.2 million has so far been paid in commitment fees to Bombardier and European aircraft maker Airbus. But she did not reveal the total asset cost but said $400,000 had been deposited on each of the Airbuses while $100,000 apiece had been paid for each of the CRJs. According to list prices, a single CRJ900 costs about $48 million while Airbus published a list price of $259.9 million for the A330-800. Another Ush129 billion ($3.5 million) has been committed to the project in the budget for fiscal 2018\/19 that starts on July 1, 2018, to fund other aspects of related procurement. The CRJs which will be used to develop a regional feeder network for intercontinental flights are expected to arrive in time for a November-December launch while the A330s will join the fleet in December 2020. Breakeven is projected at four years at the earliest and five years in the extreme. Azuba however, says that sustainability rather than profitability was the primary concern and the government was looking at how to help the carrier consolidate its revenue sources. She hinted at a possible shakeup of several aspects of Entebbe International Airport saying the national carrier could earn ancillary revenue from ground handling, catering and inflight services. Those services, previously a monopoly of Uganda Airlines were spun-off and concession to private entities in 1995. “We are looking at this as economic infrastructure, so its profitability should also be looked at in the broader context of its potential for multiplier effects on sectors such as tourism and the cost of moving into and out of Uganda by air,” she says. She declined to discuss details of the route structure but a business plan and management structure have been completed and key positions would soon be advertised. A new board will also be constituted for the airline. “We have about six key positions. The current project team will drive the project up to launch but those who have the qualifications set out in the job description will be eligible to apply and join the team.”\nUganda liquidated its former debt ridden national carrier in 2000 and the operator code QU was sold to a private carrier – East African Airlines- that folded in 2003. Officials have not revealed any details about the revamped carrier’s branding.\n\nQatar Fund for Development (QFFD) signed an agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock and the Ministry of Energy and Hydraulics of the Republic of Guinea-Conakry to finance several development projects in the rural areas of the country at an estimated total cost of $20mn. The agreement includes road infrastructure rehabilitation projects, construction of bridges, reservoirs and digging wells. The project aims to benefit rural communities by rehabilitating several road sections with a total of 866km of roads in 17 provinces. In addition, a total of three bridges of 395m have already been constructed under this project, providing better accessibility to the local communities. This project will facilitate mobility of the population, promote economic growth and create new jobs. It will also contribute to improving the mobility of goods in better conditions. In addition, the project includes the digging of 5,000 water wells and the installation of solar water pumps and water tanks in seven rural provinces. This project will ensure a decent standard of living for the population in those areas. These projects are part of the QFFD’s interest in long-term development projects. They will enhance security; ensure stability and a decent standard of living for the current and future generations. LEAVE A COMMENT Your email address will not be published.

The launching ceremony was officially worked yesterday morning, the Prime Minister Séléagodji Ahoomey-Zunu. Are we going to the end of a nightmare for users of the segment commonly known lagoon Bè-Dove of Peace ? The answer to this question is yes, insofar as prayer issued by the Togolese people and especially those wearing the path that is in disrepair for more than a year, is being exalted. In fact, last Thursday, October 11, this section, for his rehabilitation, was officially handed over to the company \"GER\" by the Prime Minister, Séléagodji Ahoomey-Zunu in the presence of the Minister of Public Works, Ninsao Gnofame and other members of the government, during a ceremony to launch the work. These rehabilitation and modernization of said channel will be executed at a cost of two billion five hundred million FCFA and must be completed within eight months, to stick to what the contracting parties. The section consists of three main components : This is Maman N’danida Avenue, the Avenue de France and ramp space furnished. It will be done with a modern architecture, according to reports. Moreover, according to the Togolese authorities, this section will be refurbished as part of the comprehensive project of rehabilitation, strengthening and modernization of road infrastructure implemented in recent years by the government.

        {
            "passage": "Construction of Entebbe-Kibuye road in Uganda 50% complete\nThe 22 kilometres road section between Entebbe and Kibuye is being rehabilitated by Chinese contractor, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com\/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

            "passage": "Kampala – Entebbe Expressway\nOpened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala – Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda’s international Airport. This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.",

            "passage": "WFP APPEALS FOR FUNDS FOR DEMINING AND ROAD REPAIRS IN SOUTH SUDAN\nNAIROBI -WFP today appealed for urgent funding for road repairs and demining of key transport routes in southern Sudan to help people return after decades of war, and connect the region to northern Sudan and neighbouring countries. WFP said it faced an immediate shortfall of US$4.8 million in 2004 for the first phase and would need US$64 million for a special operation in 2005. It said funds for 2005 are needed as soon as possible because work should be done as much as possible during the dry season from October 2004 to May 2005. \"Investment in infrastructure is crucial to getting southern Sudan on its long-awaited road to recovery after decades of conflict. It is also urgent because between 600,000 and 1.2 million people are expected to return after the signing of a final peace agreement for the south,\" said Barbara van Logchem, WFP Project Manager for the Special Operation. \"These roads are the arteries to attract people back to the south. Delayed funding now means less opportunity for repairs during the dry season, which in turn means no visible peace dividend. This also delays economic growth and resettlement for people desperate for a new beginning,\" she added. The Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement\/Army (SPLM\/A) are expected to sign a final peace agreement covering the south by the end of December. South Sudan covers 650,000 square kilometers -- the size of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi combined. Yet the total road network is only 7,500 kilometres of main roads, most of which are unusable at least for part of the year, plus 10,000 kilometres of key feeder roads. None are tarmac except for a few kilometers in Juba town. WFP's Special Road Operation aims to facilitate the return and resettlement of people while providing visual, tangible peace dividends and contributing to conflict prevention. Better roads also stimulate economic growth through increased transportation and trade. With roads linked to the River Nile, the cost of food production and delivery will be reduced while farmers' access to markets will grow. In addition, the delivery costs of food aid will decrease and eventually the need for large quantities of aid to support people in southern Sudan should diminish. The first phase of WFP road repairs and demining ran from January until October this year, budgeted at US$21 million. It included the repair of three main routes: the Western Corridor linking south Sudan to Uganda, the Eastern Corridor linking the south to Kenya and a dyke\/road project in Bor County to mitigate flooding from the Nile, improve food security and start opening up access to the north. Already, daily bus services have started from Uganda into Sudan and up to the town of Yei and more types of vehicles are using the road, allowing small entrepreneurs to use pickups. Transport rates have dropped and prices of basic items such as maize, soap, sugar, soap and fuel have decreased by 20 percent in Yei since the beginning of the year. The second phase, covered by the Special Operation, aims to demine and repair eight additional routes for a total distance of 1,600 kilometres. Implementation of the second phase, which could have started in October 2004 was delayed to January 2005 because of a lack of funding. The WFP Special Operation activities were identified as an urgent need by the SPLM at the Oslo donor meeting in September 2004. Work can commence as soon as funding is made available. The project will ensure an immediate and visible impact on the ground. To date, WFP's road repair and demining in southern Sudan since January this year has received contributions from the United States (US$16.7 million), the Netherlands (US$3.3 million), Norway (US$1 million) and Italy (US$300,000). Note to Editors and Reporters Covering the Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World: video and photographs are available of road rehabilitation and demining in Sudan\nWFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency: in 2003 we gave food aid to a record 104 million people in 81 countries, including 56 million hungry children.

Two key elements will be covered under the project, namely a new multi lane highway connecting Kampala to the international airport in Entebbe and a branch route from Lweza to Munyonyo, a convention and resort centre at the shores of Lake Victoria. The second is of particular importance as visitors coming for meetings, conventions, conferences and large scale government meetings will upon completion be able to bypass the city entirely on their way from the airport to Munyonyo. The main section though, just over 51 kilometres long, will be operated as a toll road with users having to part with the shillings, worth though considering the time savings one can generate. The cost, estimated to be in the region of 450+ US Dollars, is financed by China – a Chinese construction company will carry out the work, similar in scope to the new super highway between Nairobi and Thika in Kenya – with the Ugandan government chipping in an estimated 100 million US Dollars to the overall cost. Like neighbouring Kenya, Uganda too has finally and almost belatedly woken to the reality that new roads, highways and bridges are key to future economic and social development. The planned construction of a new Nile bridge in Jinja is due to start in 2013, eventually connecting the new widened 4 lane highway planned between Kampala and Jinja and from Jinja to the border with Kenya in Malaba and Busia. This project is also thought to be in the final planning stages. Today though all eyes will be on the new Entebbe highway project, due to be completed within about three years time at which time us locals as well as our regular visitors will be able to take a collective breath of relief.",

The objective of the Regional Seminar is to raise awareness about the importance and benefits of performance-based contracts and framework agreements for roads, and facilitate the sharing of practitioners’ experiences and best practices. The Seminar will be conducted back to back with the Africa Regional Workshop on Performance- Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads. A three-day Regional Workshop, whose objective is to provide practitioners responsible for managing and maintaining road networks with sufficiently detailed tools, examples and practical knowledge for successfully implementing performance-based contracts and framework agreements for the roads for which they are responsible, will be held from 15th – 17th, December 2022. Only those participants who will attend the Africa Regional Seminar on Performance-Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads to be held at the Arusha International Conference Centre, Arusha, Tanzania, from 12th – 14th, December 2022, will be allowed to participate in the Africa Regional Workshop on Performance- Based Contracts and Framework Agreements for Roads. What is a Performance Based Contract? The method of delivering road maintenance has progressively evolved. Historically, road agencies have moved from using in-house force account to traditional method-based maintenance contracting. Many countries are now heading towards performance-based contracting (PBC), an approach that has been deployed rapidly in the road sector in the past decade. However, while PBC offers a number of benefits for road agencies and road users, it is a relatively new approach and there are several aspects that need careful consideration to ensure that the goals of PBCs are fully achieved. Performance-based contracts (PBC) differ significantly from method-based contracts that have been traditionally used to maintain roads. PBC is a type of contract in which payments for the management and maintenance of road assets are explicitly linked to the contractor successfully meeting or exceeding certain clearly defined minimum performance indicators. Such contracts could potentially include management of infrastructures and activities such as road works, drainage system, pavements, traffic and roadside assets, bridges, tunnels, traffic services, and emergency response. In traditional method-based contracts, the road agency as a client normally specifies techniques, technologies, materials and quantities of materials to be used, together with the time during which the maintenance works should be executed. The payment to the contractor is based on the amount of inputs (e.g., cubic meters of asphalt concrete, number of working hours). In performance-based contracting the client does not specify any method or material requirements (provided the country’s standards are met). Instead the client specifies performance indicators that the contractor is required to meet when delivering maintenance services. According to the World Bank Standard Procurement Document for Output- and Performance-Based Road Contracts (2021),1 under the performance-based approach, the services to be provided by the Output- and Performance-Based Road Contract (OPBRC) is a form of PBC for which the World Bank has issued standard procurement documents. Contractor go much beyond the mere execution of pre-defined physical works. The Contract covers an array of activities needed to achieve and maintain a certain Service Level for road users, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance, as well as several activities related to the management (including periodic evaluation) of the road network under contract. It includes carrying out Rehabilitation Works, Improvement Works, as well as Emergency Works needed to reinstate the Roads after damage has occurred as a result of natural phenomena (such as strong storms, flooding and earthquakes). The PBC\/OPBRC competitive procurement process results in a contractual relationship where payments are made for measured outputs instead of the traditional way where the measurement and payment reflect the quantity of input.

USAID\/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID\/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID\/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID\/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment.

In its report, GAO concluded that USAID\/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID\/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID\/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities. OIG photograph of road construction near the Raba River bridge crossing at Km 25 in Aceh Province, Indonesia. (March 2007) AUDIT OBJECTIVE The Regional Inspector General\/Manila conducted this audit as part of its fiscal year 2007 annual audit plan to answer the following question: Is USAID\/Indonesia managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its • Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost?

While USAID\/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk.

Speaking on the sidelines of a manifesto review event for the works sector on Wednesday, Monica Azuba Ntege, the minister for Works, told The EastAfrican that the government was concluding export finance negotiations for four Canadair Regional Jets 900 series (CRJ-900) that will form the backbone of an eventual fleet of six aircraft. “We have made some deposits on the aircraft and we are negotiating export finance for them with Canadian financiers. We expect that source to fund 70-80 per cent of the value of that acquisition while we fund the remainder from other sources,” she said. Parallel negotiations, although of lesser urgency, are ongoing with a consortium of Germany, French and British banks to advance export credit for a pair of Airbus A330-800 series that will form the core of the long distance fleet. Ms Azuba said that the government was exploring a mix of finance options and could borrow from other sources in the interim to bridge any funding gaps. The Minister said that $1.2 million has so far been paid in commitment fees to Bombardier and European aircraft maker Airbus. But she did not reveal the total asset cost but said $400,000 had been deposited on each of the Airbuses while $100,000 apiece had been paid for each of the CRJs. According to list prices, a single CRJ900 costs about $48 million while Airbus published a list price of $259.9 million for the A330-800. Another Ush129 billion ($3.5 million) has been committed to the project in the budget for fiscal 2018\/19 that starts on July 1, 2018, to fund other aspects of related procurement. The CRJs which will be used to develop a regional feeder network for intercontinental flights are expected to arrive in time for a November-December launch while the A330s will join the fleet in December 2020. Breakeven is projected at four years at the earliest and five years in the extreme. Azuba however, says that sustainability rather than profitability was the primary concern and the government was looking at how to help the carrier consolidate its revenue sources. She hinted at a possible shakeup of several aspects of Entebbe International Airport saying the national carrier could earn ancillary revenue from ground handling, catering and inflight services. Those services, previously a monopoly of Uganda Airlines were spun-off and concession to private entities in 1995. “We are looking at this as economic infrastructure, so its profitability should also be looked at in the broader context of its potential for multiplier effects on sectors such as tourism and the cost of moving into and out of Uganda by air,” she says. She declined to discuss details of the route structure but a business plan and management structure have been completed and key positions would soon be advertised. A new board will also be constituted for the airline. “We have about six key positions. The current project team will drive the project up to launch but those who have the qualifications set out in the job description will be eligible to apply and join the team.”\nUganda liquidated its former debt ridden national carrier in 2000 and the operator code QU was sold to a private carrier – East African Airlines- that folded in 2003. Officials have not revealed any details about the revamped carrier’s branding.",

    "text": "What is a Corporation? A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.",

    "gold": "Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. Additionally, there's a double taxation situation where the corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, and then shareholders must pay taxes on that income themselves. However, corporate profits are taxed at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay.",
    "answer": "Corporations, compared to other business structures, have distinct tax implications. The primary difference is that corporations are subject to double taxation. This means that the corporation itself pays taxes on its profits at the corporate tax rate, and then when profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends, the shareholders pay personal income tax on those dividends. \n\nIn contrast, other business structures such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations are pass-through entities. This means that the business itself does not pay income tax; instead, the income is passed through to the individual owners, who report it on their personal tax returns and pay tax at their individual income tax rates. This avoids the double taxation that corporations face.\n\nHere are some key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures:\n\n1. **Double Taxation**: As mentioned, the most significant tax implication for corporations is double taxation. This can make the net income for shareholders lower than it would be in a pass-through entity.\n\n2. **Corporate Tax Rates**: Corporations are subject to corporate income tax rates, which are generally higher than the individual tax rates that apply to pass-through entities. However, there are instances where the corporate tax rates can be lower than personal tax rates due to various tax credits and deductions.\n\n3. **Dividend Tax**: When corporations distribute profits to shareholders, these distributions are taxed as dividends at personal income tax rates. This can result in a higher overall tax rate for shareholders compared to other business structures.\n\n4. **Tax Planning Opportunities**: Corporations have several tax planning opportunities, such as the ability to set aside earnings as retained earnings, which are not immediately taxed. This can provide flexibility in managing tax liabilities.\n\n5. **Depreciation and Amortization**: Corporations can often take advantage of accelerated depreciation and amortization methods, which can reduce taxable income and, consequently, tax liability.\n\n6. **Income Shifting**: Corporations can potentially shift income to low-tax jurisdictions or to shareholders in lower tax brackets through various strategies, although this can be subject to anti-avoidance rules.\n\n7. **International Taxation**: Corporations engaged in international business may face additional complexities, such as foreign tax credits, controlled foreign corporation rules, and transfer pricing regulations.\n\n8. **S-Corporation Advantage**: S-corporations, a type of corporation, can elect to pass through profits and losses to their shareholders, avoiding double taxation but still providing the liability protection of a corporation.\n\nWhen deciding on a business structure, it's crucial to consider not only the tax implications but also factors such as liability protection, ease of raising capital, and the ability to retain and reward employees. Each business structure has its unique advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the business and its owners.",
    "final_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: When conceptualizing a new venture, this decision is seldom given the thought and consideration it deserves. Start your business the right way by addressing this first. By Michael F. O'Keefe\nWHETHER SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S-Corporation, or C-Corporation, it is vital to understand, not only the filing and paperwork requirements, but also the different tax implications that are present with each type of business structure. Commonly, owner-operated small businesses are set up as sole proprietorships due to the simplicity of the filings and regulation, as well as the single-layer tax impact on the revenues of the business. This type of ownership also allows the owner to be his or her own boss. However, owners should be extremely cautious when dealing as a sole proprietor or in a general partnership. These two types of business structures allow for all of the liabilities of the business to be shared with the individual owners on a personal level. As such, unlimited liability can be scary. Just remember to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Don’t choose a business structure based on the ease and convenience of setting it up. It is more common than one would think to have business situations end in lawsuits resulting in general partners and sole proprietors being sued personally and losing homes, cars and savings accounts. There are plenty of hurdles that these types of business owners have to overcome. Management can be difficult with limited participants and there is commonly a very overwhelming time commitment associated with this type of business. There are two types of members in a partnership: a general partner and a limited partner. General partners have unlimited liability and they are typically managers of the company. Limited partners have exactly what you would think: limited liability. They, also, usually do not have a role managing the company. Just remember, no matter how well the individual partners get along, one of the most common issues with partnerships is the disagreements that arise between members. This sometimes leads to unfortunate falling-outs between friends. Most successful types of businesses are corporations—either limited liability companies, conventional corporations (C-Corps), or S-Corporations. These three forms of business ownership comprise approximately 80% of all sales in the United States and they all share two major benefits; the first being that they have limited liability, and the second, they usually qualify for special tax advantages that other types of business ownerships do not. Incorporating a business is a great strategy as it allows for the company to grow, it has perpetual life, ownership can change hands easily, and it’s common for corporations to be able to afford talented employees. However, as a sword can cut both ways, there are some disadvantages to incorporating a business. Corporations are more costly to start, they require more paperwork, possible conflicts with other owners and board members can arise, and they are also affected by double taxation, which means that the business’ profits will be taxed, as well as the shareholders’ dividends. A special type of incorporation is called an S-Corporation. Aside from sharing the benefit of limited liability, this type of corporation has a major difference from a conventional C-Corporation: It has much simpler taxes, called ‘single taxation,’ that are similar to that of a partnership. Downsides of incorporating as an S-Corporation include ineligibility for a dividends received deduction, and that S-Corps are not subject to the 10% of taxable income limitation that are applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Choosing the best type of business is a personal choice, albeit one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The prospected longevity, growth and future development of the business should be taken into serious consideration before the choice to incorporate is made.\n\nWhen it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the \"limited liability\" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders\/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or \"company buy back\" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the \"members\" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective. Please contact your usual MG Group contact if you would like to find out more about the options available in setting up a business structure and to determine what the advantages and disadvantages are from each type of business structure.\n\nAs a small business owner, it's important to understand the tax implications of your business decisions. Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities. If you do business in multiple countries, you may be subject to international tax laws and regulations. A business attorney or a tax expert can advise you on your international tax obligations.

In their book, Start Your Own Business, the staff of Entrepreneur Media Inc. guides you through the critical steps to starting a business, then supports you in surviving the first three years as a business owner. In this edited excerpt, the authors briefly review the different legal business structures you may want to choose for your small business. Of all the decisions you make when starting a business, one of the most important ones is the type of legal structure you select for your company. Not only will this decision have an impact on how much you pay in taxes, but it will affect the amount of paperwork your business is required to do, the personal liability you face and your ability to raise money. The simplest structure is the sole proprietorship, which usually involves just one individual who owns and operates the enterprise. With a sole proprietorship, your business earnings are taxed only once, unlike other business structures. Another big plus is that you will have complete control over your business—you make all the decisions. The tax aspects of a sole proprietorship are appealing because the expenses and your income from the business are included on your personal income tax return, Form 1040. Your profits and losses are recorded on a form called Schedule C, which is filed with your 1040. The “bottom-line amount” from Schedule C is then transferred to your personal tax return. This is especially attractive because business losses you suffer may offset the income you have earned from your other sources. There are a few disadvantages to consider. Selecting the sole proprietorship business structure means you're personally responsible for your company’s liabilities, so you're placing your assets at risk, and they could be seized to satisfy a business debt or a legal claim filed against you. Raising money for a sole proprietorship can also be difficult. Banks and other financing sources may be reluctant to make business loans to sole proprietorships. In most cases, you'll have to depend on your financing sources, such as savings, home equity, or family loans. If your business will be owned and operated by several individuals, you’ll want to take a look at structuring your business as either a general partnership or a limited partnership. In a general partnership, the partners manage the company and assume responsibility for the partnership’s debts and other obligations. A limited partnership has both general and limited partners. The general partners own and operate the business and assume liability for the partnership, while the limited partners serve as investors only; they have no control over the company and are not subject to the same liabilities as the general partners. Unless you expect to have many passive investors, limited partnerships generally aren't the best choice for a new business because of all the required filings and administrative complexities. One of the major advantages of a partnership is the tax treatment it enjoys. A partnership doesn't pay tax on its income but “passes through” any profits or losses to the individual partners. On the other hand, personal liability is a major concern if you choose a general partnership. Like sole proprietors, general partners are personally liable for the partnership’s obligations and debts. The corporate structure is more complex and expensive than most other business structures. A corporation is an independent legal entity, separate from its owners, and as such, it requires complying with more regulations and tax requirements. The biggest benefit for a business owner is the liability protection the business owner receives. A corporation’s debt is not considered that of its owners, so if you organize your business as a corporation, you're not putting your personal assets at risk. A corporation also can retain some of its profits without the owner paying tax on them. Another plus is the ability of a corporation to raise money. A corporation can sell stock to raise funds. Corporations also continue indefinitely, even if one of the shareholders dies, sells the shares or becomes disabled. The corporate structure, however, comes with a number of downsides. A major one is higher costs. Corporations are formed under the laws of each state with its own set of regulations. You'll probably need the assistance of an attorney to guide you. In addition, because a corporation must follow more complex rules and regulations than a partnership or sole proprietorship, it requires more accounting and tax preparation services. Another drawback to forming a corporation: Owners of the corporation pay a double tax on the business’s earnings.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the activity of businesses that are subject to the individual income tax has grown compared with that of businesses subject to the corporate income tax. That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:\nThis report was prepared by Paul Burnham of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division.\n\nStart a Business\nStarting a business is similar to building an actual building.

This type is based on personal ownership. Property and liabilities are held in someone's name. This can be either an individual (normally) or a married couple. Home businesses often use this type. It is simple and cheap. Business taxes are filed as personal income. Liability is also personal, which is a disadvantage. In most areas, starting a sole proprietorship is as easy as filing a DBA (Doing Business As). Some locations (and types of businesses) may require other licensing. Fees are minimal. Required records are similar to personal tax records. The most basic mirrors a sole proprietorship. The key document is the partnership agreement. This spells out the division of ownership. In a General Partnership, the responsibilities are shared across partners. Management duties and profits are shared as well. There are no direct taxes on a partnership; taxes are handled as personal taxes on each partner. There are other, special types of partnerships. These are more like corporations. Limited Liability Partnerships, Professional Partnerships and Limited Partnerships give more flexibility and alter liability. This is a more complex legal structure. The key difference is that a corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners. Ownership is through stock in the company. Stock may be privately held or public. The ability to offer stock for sale is an advantage. It allows for financing outside of direct loans. Another advantage is the protection a corporation offers by limiting liability. Startup costs are higher with a corporation. There are more formalities and regulation issues. Taxes are also business based instead of individual. This subtype of corporation has one advantage over a C Corp. Taxes are paid like they are for partnerships. IRS requirements must be met, but the S Corp taxing method is a benefit. Other advantages of a C Corp are retained. This form combines the advantages of a corporation and those of a partnership or sole proprietorship. It doesn’t require the formal structure of a ‘real’ corporation, but still limits owner liability. Taxes are done as they are for a partnership (or sole proprietorship). One disadvantage is the inability to issue stock to raise capital. This is a type of corporation dedicated to some civic, religious, educational, or charitable goal. They are tax exempt. A board of directors (or trustees) is required. One particularity of non profits is that they cannot be sold, but their assets must be transferred to another non profit if they are dissolved. This is available to some professions, depending on the state. It is a limited liability type of corporation where all the shareholders also hold a professional license. Doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals might find this an attractive choice because it limits their personal liability.

The S corporation is more attractive to small-business owners than a regular (or C) corporation because an S corporation has some appealing tax benefits and still provides business owners with the liability protection of a corporation. With an S corporation, income and losses are passed through to shareholders and included on their individual tax returns. As a result, there’s just one level of federal tax to pay. In addition, owners of S corporations who don’t have inventory can use the cash method of accounting, which is simpler than the accrual method. S corporations can also have up to 100 shareholders. This makes it possible to have more investors and thus attract more capital, tax experts maintain. S corporations do come with some downsides. For example, S corporations are subject to many of the same rules corporations must follow, and that means higher legal and tax service costs. They also must file articles of incorporation, hold directors and shareholders meetings, keep corporate minutes, and allow shareholders to vote on major corporate decisions. The legal and accounting costs of setting up an S corporation are also similar to those for a regular corporation. Another major difference between a regular corporation and an S corporation is that S corporations can only issue one class of stock. Experts say this can hamper the company’s ability to raise capital. In addition, unlike in a regular corporation, S corporation stock can only be owned by individuals, estates and certain types of trusts. In 1998, tax-exempt organizations such as qualified pension plans were added to the list. This change provides S corporations with even greater access to capital because a number of pension plans are willing to invest in closely held small-business stock. Putting Inc. to Paper\nTo start the process of incorporating, contact the secretary of state or the state office that's responsible for registering corporations in your state. Ask for instructions, forms and fee schedules on incorporating. It's possible to file for incorporation without the help of an attorney by using books and software to guide you. Your expense will be the cost of these resources, the filing fees and other costs associated with incorporating in your state. If you do it yourself, you'll save the expense of using a lawyer, which can cost from $500 to $5,000 if you choose a firm that specializes in startup businesses. The disadvantage is that the process may take you some time to accomplish. There is also a chance you could miss some small but important detail in your state’s law. One of the first steps in the incorporation process is to prepare a certificate or articles of incorporation. Some states provide a printed form for this, which either you or your attorney can complete. The corporation will also need a set of bylaws that describe in greater detail than the articles how the corporation will run, including the responsibilities of the company’s shareholders, directors and officers; when stockholder meetings will be held; and other details important to running the company. Once your articles of incorporation are accepted, the secretary of state’s office will send you a certificate of incorporation. Laying the Foundation\nWhen making a decision about which business structure to use, answering the following questions should help you narrow down which entity is right for you:\n- How many owners will your company have, and what will their roles be? - Are you concerned about the tax consequences of your business structure? - Do you want to consider having employees become owners in the company? - Can you deal with the added costs that come with selecting a complicated business structure? - How much paperwork are you prepared to deal with? - Do you want to make all the decisions in the company? - Are you planning to go public? - Do you want to protect your personal resources from debts or other claims against your company? - Are family succession issues a concern? Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits.\n\nIf you've been in business for a while as a sole proprietor, you may be wondering whether it would be a good idea to incorporate. We can help you make that decision with information on: why a business owner would want to incorporate, how a corporation is structured, and how corporations are taxed. Reasons for incorporating\nPicture this: You started a small landscaping business a few years ago as a sole proprietorship with three employees. Demand was so great for your services that you kept hiring more people and taking on debt to purchase more equipment, and the number of customers has soared. But lately you've started to wonder: What happens if business slows and you can't pay back all the debt? What if a disgruntled employee or unhappy customer sues you? As a sole proprietor you're personally liable for any bad debts and legal judgments against your business, meaning that your home and other personal assets are likely at risk. When you incorporate, you're creating a completely separate legal entity, one that can shoulder the liability burden you had been carrying yourself (or if you are a partnership, the burden you and the other partners were carrying). Forming a corporation also allows you to:\n- Reward and retain key staff by giving workers a piece of the business. - Have more options for raising funds. Instead of going into more debt, you can attract equity investors. - Shift tax liability away from you to the corporate entity. But you'll have to weigh some disadvantages as well:\n- It usually takes more time and money to incorporate than to form other types of businesses. - Corporations typically are subject to more regulation at both the federal and state level, and the tax rules can be more complicated. - The management structure of a corporation is usually more rigid, often giving you, as the owner, less flexibility to run things as you see fit. Typically, a corporation has a three-tiered structure, which consists of:\n- Shareholders: As company owners, they are the linchpins of the corporation. They often have the power to select and remove directors, amend bylaws, approve the sale of assets and dissolve the corporation. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of shareholders. In fact, most states permit one person to hold 100% of the corporation's stock. - Directors: They act on behalf of the stockholders, managing the company, making major decisions about the firm's direction and electing company officers. Most states allow corporations to have a single director, but some require a minimum of three. - Officers: In most states, corporations must have at least a president, secretary and treasurer to handle day-to-day running of the business, but many states also allow one person to hold all three positions. Steps to becoming a corporation\nTo get your corporation started, you'll need to draw up Articles of Incorporation in the state where your business is headquartered. The articles declare basic facts about the company, including its name, purpose and the number of shares authorized. You file this document with the appropriate state office (usually the Secretary of State or Department of Commerce) and pay a filing fee, which can be as much as several hundred dollars. You may want to hire an attorney to handle the process. Most states will process your filing and send you a Certificate of Incorporation. With your Certificate in hand, you can take the next steps, including appointing directors and holding your first directors' meeting. You'll need to draw up bylaws, which detail the rights of the shareholders, directors and officers. You also must issue stock. It doesn't have to be widely-held, but generally must be distributed to everyone who is an owner of the corporation. Tax issues for corporations\nOnce you have incorporated, you'll probably notice a big difference in how your company is treated for tax purposes. You'll no longer file Schedule C and report your net profit or loss on your 1040. Instead, the corporation files a business tax return, Form 1120, and if it is a C-Corp, pays tax on its corporate profits. Many owners of new, small corporations may get a pleasant surprise at tax time. That's because sole proprietors can't deduct any salaries they pay themselves, but after incorporating they become employees, and their compensation can be written off by the corporate entity. Once those and other deductions are taken, there may be little corporate profit left to tax.\n\nSome Business Tax Impacts:\n- The business tax rates are cut 20% for C-Corporations (25% for personal service C-Corps)\nand a maximum of 25% for partnerships, S-Corps, and sole proprietorships. However, the\nlower tax rate for pass-through entities does not apply to service sector entities, except to the\nextent the argument can be made that the income results from something other than what\nshould be considered “compensation” to the owners. Therein lies the “rub”, and likely where a\nlot of time and resources will be spent in tax return preparation. - Section 179 limits increase to $5,000,000 with phase out beginning at $20,000,000 of assets\npurchased in one year, for asset purchases between 2018 and 2022. - Limits interest expense to no more than 30% of the business’s taxable income for businesses\nwith more than $25,000,000 of gross receipts. - Reduces the NOL deduction to only 90% of taxable income. - Corporations with earned income parked offshore would be hit with a one-time tax of 12% for\nliquid holdings, and 5% on others. However, they would then be free to bring their earnings\nback to the US tax-free. Additional future earnings would also be taxed at the same rates, and\nwould also be allowed to be repatriated tax-free. - Greatly impacts the tax regime for companies doing business in other countries, and foreign\nowned companies doing business in the US.

By Michael F. O'Keefe\nWHETHER SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S-Corporation, or C-Corporation, it is vital to understand, not only the filing and paperwork requirements, but also the different tax implications that are present with each type of business structure. Commonly, owner-operated small businesses are set up as sole proprietorships due to the simplicity of the filings and regulation, as well as the single-layer tax impact on the revenues of the business. This type of ownership also allows the owner to be his or her own boss. However, owners should be extremely cautious when dealing as a sole proprietor or in a general partnership. These two types of business structures allow for all of the liabilities of the business to be shared with the individual owners on a personal level. As such, unlimited liability can be scary. Just remember to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Don’t choose a business structure based on the ease and convenience of setting it up. It is more common than one would think to have business situations end in lawsuits resulting in general partners and sole proprietors being sued personally and losing homes, cars and savings accounts. There are plenty of hurdles that these types of business owners have to overcome. Management can be difficult with limited participants and there is commonly a very overwhelming time commitment associated with this type of business. There are two types of members in a partnership: a general partner and a limited partner. General partners have unlimited liability and they are typically managers of the company. Limited partners have exactly what you would think: limited liability. They, also, usually do not have a role managing the company. Just remember, no matter how well the individual partners get along, one of the most common issues with partnerships is the disagreements that arise between members. This sometimes leads to unfortunate falling-outs between friends. Most successful types of businesses are corporations—either limited liability companies, conventional corporations (C-Corps), or S-Corporations. These three forms of business ownership comprise approximately 80% of all sales in the United States and they all share two major benefits; the first being that they have limited liability, and the second, they usually qualify for special tax advantages that other types of business ownerships do not. Incorporating a business is a great strategy as it allows for the company to grow, it has perpetual life, ownership can change hands easily, and it’s common for corporations to be able to afford talented employees. However, as a sword can cut both ways, there are some disadvantages to incorporating a business. Corporations are more costly to start, they require more paperwork, possible conflicts with other owners and board members can arise, and they are also affected by double taxation, which means that the business’ profits will be taxed, as well as the shareholders’ dividends. A special type of incorporation is called an S-Corporation. Aside from sharing the benefit of limited liability, this type of corporation has a major difference from a conventional C-Corporation: It has much simpler taxes, called ‘single taxation,’ that are similar to that of a partnership. Downsides of incorporating as an S-Corporation include ineligibility for a dividends received deduction, and that S-Corps are not subject to the 10% of taxable income limitation that are applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Choosing the best type of business is a personal choice, albeit one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The prospected longevity, growth and future development of the business should be taken into serious consideration before the choice to incorporate is made.",

            "passage": "When it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the \"limited liability\" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders\/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or \"company buy back\" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the \"members\" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective.

Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities.

            "passage": "Which Business Structure Is Right for You? In their book, Start Your Own Business, the staff of Entrepreneur Media Inc. guides you through the critical steps to starting a business, then supports you in surviving the first three years as a business owner. In this edited excerpt, the authors briefly review the different legal business structures you may want to choose for your small business. Of all the decisions you make when starting a business, one of the most important ones is the type of legal structure you select for your company. Not only will this decision have an impact on how much you pay in taxes, but it will affect the amount of paperwork your business is required to do, the personal liability you face and your ability to raise money. The simplest structure is the sole proprietorship, which usually involves just one individual who owns and operates the enterprise. With a sole proprietorship, your business earnings are taxed only once, unlike other business structures. Another big plus is that you will have complete control over your business—you make all the decisions. The tax aspects of a sole proprietorship are appealing because the expenses and your income from the business are included on your personal income tax return, Form 1040. Your profits and losses are recorded on a form called Schedule C, which is filed with your 1040. The “bottom-line amount” from Schedule C is then transferred to your personal tax return. This is especially attractive because business losses you suffer may offset the income you have earned from your other sources. There are a few disadvantages to consider. Selecting the sole proprietorship business structure means you're personally responsible for your company’s liabilities, so you're placing your assets at risk, and they could be seized to satisfy a business debt or a legal claim filed against you. Raising money for a sole proprietorship can also be difficult. Banks and other financing sources may be reluctant to make business loans to sole proprietorships. In most cases, you'll have to depend on your financing sources, such as savings, home equity, or family loans. If your business will be owned and operated by several individuals, you’ll want to take a look at structuring your business as either a general partnership or a limited partnership. In a general partnership, the partners manage the company and assume responsibility for the partnership’s debts and other obligations. A limited partnership has both general and limited partners. The general partners own and operate the business and assume liability for the partnership, while the limited partners serve as investors only; they have no control over the company and are not subject to the same liabilities as the general partners. Unless you expect to have many passive investors, limited partnerships generally aren't the best choice for a new business because of all the required filings and administrative complexities. One of the major advantages of a partnership is the tax treatment it enjoys. A partnership doesn't pay tax on its income but “passes through” any profits or losses to the individual partners. On the other hand, personal liability is a major concern if you choose a general partnership. Like sole proprietors, general partners are personally liable for the partnership’s obligations and debts. The corporate structure is more complex and expensive than most other business structures. A corporation is an independent legal entity, separate from its owners, and as such, it requires complying with more regulations and tax requirements. The biggest benefit for a business owner is the liability protection the business owner receives. A corporation’s debt is not considered that of its owners, so if you organize your business as a corporation, you're not putting your personal assets at risk. A corporation also can retain some of its profits without the owner paying tax on them. Another plus is the ability of a corporation to raise money. A corporation can sell stock to raise funds. Corporations also continue indefinitely, even if one of the shareholders dies, sells the shares or becomes disabled. The corporate structure, however, comes with a number of downsides. A major one is higher costs. Corporations are formed under the laws of each state with its own set of regulations. You'll probably need the assistance of an attorney to guide you. In addition, because a corporation must follow more complex rules and regulations than a partnership or sole proprietorship, it requires more accounting and tax preparation services. Another drawback to forming a corporation: Owners of the corporation pay a double tax on the business’s earnings.",

That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively.

The key difference is that a corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners. Ownership is through stock in the company. Stock may be privately held or public. The ability to offer stock for sale is an advantage. It allows for financing outside of direct loans. Another advantage is the protection a corporation offers by limiting liability. Startup costs are higher with a corporation. There are more formalities and regulation issues. Taxes are also business based instead of individual. This subtype of corporation has one advantage over a C Corp. Taxes are paid like they are for partnerships. IRS requirements must be met, but the S Corp taxing method is a benefit. Other advantages of a C Corp are retained. This form combines the advantages of a corporation and those of a partnership or sole proprietorship. It doesn’t require the formal structure of a ‘real’ corporation, but still limits owner liability. Taxes are done as they are for a partnership (or sole proprietorship). One disadvantage is the inability to issue stock to raise capital. This is a type of corporation dedicated to some civic, religious, educational, or charitable goal. They are tax exempt. A board of directors (or trustees) is required. One particularity of non profits is that they cannot be sold, but their assets must be transferred to another non profit if they are dissolved. This is available to some professions, depending on the state. It is a limited liability type of corporation where all the shareholders also hold a professional license. Doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals might find this an attractive choice because it limits their personal liability. Plus, you get a 100% MONEY-BACK Guarantee *",

            "passage": "Not only are corporations subject to corporate income tax at both the federal and state levels, but any earnings distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends are taxed at individual tax rates on their personal income tax returns. The S corporation is more attractive to small-business owners than a regular (or C) corporation because an S corporation has some appealing tax benefits and still provides business owners with the liability protection of a corporation. With an S corporation, income and losses are passed through to shareholders and included on their individual tax returns. As a result, there’s just one level of federal tax to pay. In addition, owners of S corporations who don’t have inventory can use the cash method of accounting, which is simpler than the accrual method. S corporations can also have up to 100 shareholders. This makes it possible to have more investors and thus attract more capital, tax experts maintain. S corporations do come with some downsides. For example, S corporations are subject to many of the same rules corporations must follow, and that means higher legal and tax service costs. They also must file articles of incorporation, hold directors and shareholders meetings, keep corporate minutes, and allow shareholders to vote on major corporate decisions. The legal and accounting costs of setting up an S corporation are also similar to those for a regular corporation. Another major difference between a regular corporation and an S corporation is that S corporations can only issue one class of stock. Experts say this can hamper the company’s ability to raise capital. In addition, unlike in a regular corporation, S corporation stock can only be owned by individuals, estates and certain types of trusts. In 1998, tax-exempt organizations such as qualified pension plans were added to the list. This change provides S corporations with even greater access to capital because a number of pension plans are willing to invest in closely held small-business stock. Putting Inc. to Paper\nTo start the process of incorporating, contact the secretary of state or the state office that's responsible for registering corporations in your state. Ask for instructions, forms and fee schedules on incorporating. It's possible to file for incorporation without the help of an attorney by using books and software to guide you. Your expense will be the cost of these resources, the filing fees and other costs associated with incorporating in your state. If you do it yourself, you'll save the expense of using a lawyer, which can cost from $500 to $5,000 if you choose a firm that specializes in startup businesses. The disadvantage is that the process may take you some time to accomplish. There is also a chance you could miss some small but important detail in your state’s law. One of the first steps in the incorporation process is to prepare a certificate or articles of incorporation. Some states provide a printed form for this, which either you or your attorney can complete. The corporation will also need a set of bylaws that describe in greater detail than the articles how the corporation will run, including the responsibilities of the company’s shareholders, directors and officers; when stockholder meetings will be held; and other details important to running the company. Once your articles of incorporation are accepted, the secretary of state’s office will send you a certificate of incorporation. Laying the Foundation\nWhen making a decision about which business structure to use, answering the following questions should help you narrow down which entity is right for you:\n- How many owners will your company have, and what will their roles be? - Are you concerned about the tax consequences of your business structure? - Do you want to consider having employees become owners in the company? - Can you deal with the added costs that come with selecting a complicated business structure? - How much paperwork are you prepared to deal with? - Do you want to make all the decisions in the company? - Are you planning to go public? - Do you want to protect your personal resources from debts or other claims against your company? - Are family succession issues a concern? Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits.",

            "passage": "If you've been in business for a while as a sole proprietor, you may be wondering whether it would be a good idea to incorporate. We can help you make that decision with information on: why a business owner would want to incorporate, how a corporation is structured, and how corporations are taxed. Reasons for incorporating\nPicture this: You started a small landscaping business a few years ago as a sole proprietorship with three employees. Demand was so great for your services that you kept hiring more people and taking on debt to purchase more equipment, and the number of customers has soared. But lately you've started to wonder: What happens if business slows and you can't pay back all the debt? What if a disgruntled employee or unhappy customer sues you? As a sole proprietor you're personally liable for any bad debts and legal judgments against your business, meaning that your home and other personal assets are likely at risk. When you incorporate, you're creating a completely separate legal entity, one that can shoulder the liability burden you had been carrying yourself (or if you are a partnership, the burden you and the other partners were carrying). Forming a corporation also allows you to:\n- Reward and retain key staff by giving workers a piece of the business. - Have more options for raising funds. Instead of going into more debt, you can attract equity investors. - Shift tax liability away from you to the corporate entity. But you'll have to weigh some disadvantages as well:\n- It usually takes more time and money to incorporate than to form other types of businesses. - Corporations typically are subject to more regulation at both the federal and state level, and the tax rules can be more complicated. - The management structure of a corporation is usually more rigid, often giving you, as the owner, less flexibility to run things as you see fit. Typically, a corporation has a three-tiered structure, which consists of:\n- Shareholders: As company owners, they are the linchpins of the corporation. They often have the power to select and remove directors, amend bylaws, approve the sale of assets and dissolve the corporation. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of shareholders. In fact, most states permit one person to hold 100% of the corporation's stock. - Directors: They act on behalf of the stockholders, managing the company, making major decisions about the firm's direction and electing company officers. Most states allow corporations to have a single director, but some require a minimum of three. - Officers: In most states, corporations must have at least a president, secretary and treasurer to handle day-to-day running of the business, but many states also allow one person to hold all three positions. Steps to becoming a corporation\nTo get your corporation started, you'll need to draw up Articles of Incorporation in the state where your business is headquartered. The articles declare basic facts about the company, including its name, purpose and the number of shares authorized. You file this document with the appropriate state office (usually the Secretary of State or Department of Commerce) and pay a filing fee, which can be as much as several hundred dollars. You may want to hire an attorney to handle the process. Most states will process your filing and send you a Certificate of Incorporation. With your Certificate in hand, you can take the next steps, including appointing directors and holding your first directors' meeting. You'll need to draw up bylaws, which detail the rights of the shareholders, directors and officers. You also must issue stock. It doesn't have to be widely-held, but generally must be distributed to everyone who is an owner of the corporation. Tax issues for corporations\nOnce you have incorporated, you'll probably notice a big difference in how your company is treated for tax purposes. You'll no longer file Schedule C and report your net profit or loss on your 1040. Instead, the corporation files a business tax return, Form 1120, and if it is a C-Corp, pays tax on its corporate profits. Many owners of new, small corporations may get a pleasant surprise at tax time. That's because sole proprietors can't deduct any salaries they pay themselves, but after incorporating they become employees, and their compensation can be written off by the corporate entity. Once those and other deductions are taken, there may be little corporate profit left to tax.",

    "question": "How does critical illness cover work and what benefits does it provide?",
    "gold": "Critical illness cover provides a tax-free lump sum payment if you're diagnosed with a serious illness during the policy term. This offers financial security and emotional freedom to focus on recovery.",
    "answer": "Critical illness cover is a type of insurance policy designed to provide financial support in the event of a severe illness or medical condition. This coverage can help policyholders manage the costs associated with treatment, recovery, and sometimes, the impact on daily life. Here's how critical illness cover typically works and what benefits it provides:\n\n1. **Policy Structure**: When you purchase a critical illness policy, you usually pay a premium, which is a fixed amount that you agree to pay regularly (monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.). This premium is in exchange for the insurer's commitment to pay out a sum of money if you are diagnosed with one of the illnesses listed in the policy.\n\n2. **Benefits**: The main benefit of critical illness cover is the payment of a lump sum upon diagnosis of a covered condition. This lump sum is intended to help policyholders cover expenses related to medical treatment, rehabilitation, home modifications, or any other costs that may arise as a result of the illness.\n\n3. **Covered Conditions**: Policies vary, but common illnesses covered under critical illness insurance include cancer, heart attack, stroke, organ transplants, and sometimes conditions like multiple sclerosis or AIDS. Some policies may also cover specific chronic conditions or accidents. It's crucial to review the policy document to understand the specific conditions covered under your insurance.\n\n4. **Survival Period**: A key feature of critical illness cover is the survival period. This is a time frame, typically ranging from 30 days to a year or more, during which the policyholder must survive after diagnosis to be eligible for the payout. If the policyholder does not survive this period, the payout is generally not made.\n\n5. **Payout Amount**: The payout amount is predetermined at the time of purchasing the policy and is not tied to the actual costs of treatment. This means you receive a fixed sum, which can be used flexibly by the policyholder as they see fit.\n\n6. **No Coverage for Routine Medical Expenses**: Critical illness insurance does not cover routine medical expenses or ongoing treatment costs. It's specifically designed to provide a lump sum for significant illnesses that might require extensive care or lead to long-term impacts on the policyholder's life.\n\n7. **Waiting Period**: Some policies may have a waiting period for certain pre-existing conditions. This means if you are diagnosed with a condition before this period ends, you might not receive coverage for that condition until after the waiting period has elapsed.\n\n8. **Financial Impact**: The lump sum payout can help alleviate the financial burden of a critical illness, allowing individuals to focus more on recovery and less on financial stress. It can be used to pay off debts, cover medical bills not covered by other insurance, or simply to ease the financial strain on the family.\n\n9. **Tax Implications**: In some jurisdictions, the payout from a critical illness policy may be tax-free. It's important to check the tax implications specific to your country or region.\n\n10. **Complementary to Other Insurance**: Critical illness cover is often used in conjunction with other types of health insurance, such as hospital insurance or private medical cover. It's designed to complement, not replace, other forms of health coverage.\n\nIn summary, critical illness cover provides a financial safety net by offering a lump sum payment upon diagnosis of a severe illness. This can be a valuable addition to your overall financial and health planning strategy, especially if you have dependents or significant financial obligations that could be impacted by a serious illness.",

These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.\n\nMore about LTD is available in the Collective Agreement and the Sun Life Benefits Book, under Article 18.

There are several patients and elderly people who need home care and nursing. Due to their deteriorating health and ageing old, they are unable to take proper care of themselves. Numerous reasons demand shifting the patient from hospital ICU set to home ICU setups. Even at times, a caretaker is needed if the situation of the patient or the elderly person is not that critical. The reasons can be personal, emotional, or financial for requiring home nursing. HOSPITAL AND THE RISKS:\nProlonged stay at the hospital increases the risk of infection in patients. It also demands a lot of finance and can become a burden for the family and friends. A recovering patient who does not need a hospital stay can opt for setting up ICU facilities accordingly in their home. For the elderly, home care is a must if they are suffering from many ailments. If that is not the case, it is important to ensure that they are taken proper care of. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES OF HOME HEALTH CARE?

One has to remember the following points:\n- Home care enables a faster recovery due to proper tender care at home. The compliance with the treatment is much better. - It substantially lessens the chance of secondary infection from the hospitals. It is important to ensure the cleanliness of the patient’s room, which is a given when one is opting for homecare. This provides room for the doctor and healthcare professionals to work with their peace of mind. - Occupying hospital beds for a reduced period can save someone else’s life who would avail that bed. It increases the efficiency and output of the hospital.

The JAMA Report\nPatients with critical illness often experience pain and other stresses that put them at risk for developing psychiatric illnesses. These include anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. A new study examined how critical illness might contribute to psychiatric illness and the need for psychiatric medications after being admitted to the intensive care unit. Catherine Dolf explains in this week's JAMA Report.\n\nRecovery after Critical Care Booklet\nIt is recognised that recovering from critical illness does not end when you are discharged from Critical Care. For some people recovery can go on for some time following discharge home. There is a lot of information in this booklet and it is likely you will only have a few of the problems highlighted. We hope you can use it as a resource to pick out the areas where you require some information, reassurance and advice.\n\nIT started with an odd sensation in her right hand and a feeling of exhaustion so profound she could hardly get through an hour of work, let alone a full day. After numerous tests and countless doctors’ visits, Natasha Frechette, then 27, learned she had multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the central nervous system and can cause numbness, blindness and eventual paralysis. In addition to grappling with the diagnosis, Ms. Frechette was concerned about keeping her job as a data manager for a small research organization in Brooklyn Park, Minn. “I didn’t want to have to depend on someone to take care of me,” she said. \"But I know that I could wake up tomorrow and not be able to walk.\" Workers with chronic illnesses face chronic uncertainty, forced to worry not only about their health but about their jobs as well. The protections afforded chronically ill workers in the United States are thin and somewhat vague. To protect their health and their jobs, workers must navigate employers’ policies, which may include short- and long-term disability plans, as well as a patchwork of federal laws and regulations. A recent study by the Center for Economics and Policy Research, a Washington research organization, found that among 22 rich nations, the United States was the only one that did not guarantee workers paid time off for illness.Continue reading the main story\nMost other countries provide their workers not only with paid sick days, but also time off for cancer treatments, the study found. German citizens, for example, are allowed five sick days and 44 days for cancer treatment, if needed, in addition to vacation days. Most employers in the United States allow employees to take days off for minor ailments, like the flu or outpatient operations, without docking their pay. And 41 percent offer employees days off — nine, on average — for illness or other reasons, in addition to vacation days, according to a 2007 survey by Mercer, a benefits consulting business based in New York. Two laws offer workers some relief. The Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take up to 12 weeks off each year for medical or family emergencies — but without pay. And the Americans With Disabilities Act requires employers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled workers, often in the form of additional time off.

INFORM YOUR EMPLOYER If you have a condition that could interfere with your performance, tell your boss. “People are often afraid of being discriminated against,” said Rosalind Joffe, a career coach who counsels people with chronic illnesses. “I had one client who didn’t disclose his illness to anyone. His odd behavior led his boss to conclude he was a drug abuser.”\nBe honest. Explain what your condition is and how it might affect your work. “Don’t be ashamed,” Ms. Frechette said. A supervisor who understands what is wrong is less likely to make false assumptions about what you can and cannot do. “Be clear about your value and what you can deliver,” Ms. Joffe said. “If you’re a valued employee, your boss will work with you.”\nIf you feel you are being unfairly treated, speak with your supervisor. If that doesn’t work, go to the human resources department. ASK FOR ADJUSTMENTS If your illness meets the definition of a disability, your employer is required to make reasonable accommodations to your job or work environment, according to the Americans With Disabilities Act. What is a disability? “It’s a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,” said Chris Kuczynski, director of the division that deals with the disability act at the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Although your illness may be episodic or controlled by medications, it is still a disability, according to a recent amendment to the law.

Gap cover is an insurance policy you can take out to help pay for the shortfall between what your medical scheme pays and what the hospital or specialist might charge. The amount paid out depends on your policy but most people usually combine Gap Cover with a hospital plan. It is important that note that Gap Cover is not offered by medical schemes and is a separate health insurance product. As of 1 April this year, the same requirements for a medical scheme have been introduced including a waiting period of between 3 and 12 months for certain conditions and payout limit of R150 000 a year for each person. And a hospital plan? This provides you with basic, yet important medical cover and essentially covers all your required in-hospital procedures and check-ups, including the 27 chronic conditions (or PMBs). However, a hospital plan does not provide cover for day-to-day doctors’ visits, prescribed medications, chronic medication and related expenses.Some hospital plans offer value-added benefits, so read the fine print, ask questions to make sure you are getting what need. ‘The best advice I can offer is to be informed,’says Van Emmenis. ‘Take the time to read the information and fine print, compare what the plans are actually offering. If you are unsure phone the scheme and ask questions, or check with your broker.

It is usually worse in the winter period and due to the way the virus can change or mutate it is different every year. People sometimes refer to a bad cold as flu, but having flu can be much worse and it may cause an individual to stay in bed for a few days. On some occasions seasonal flu can lead to serious disease and hospitalisation, and even death, especially in vulnerable individuals e.g. those who are immunocompromised, have chronic diseases or are pregnant. The flu vaccine protects against different flu viruses each year, and a prediction is made as to which types are most likely. This means that for the best protection you need to have a vaccine every year however it also means that the vaccine is not completely protective as some virus types can circulate that were not originally predicted. The vaccine has been shown to be very effective for high risk groups, children from 6 months to 18 years, and health care workers. The effectiveness of the vaccine can be difficult to properly assess but the estimates of the benefit range from 50-75% less chance of getting the flu each year. A bout of seasonal flu would undoubtedly cause an increase in absenteeism across your workplace impacting on those employees exposed to the virus, those who are covering colleagues that are absent from work with the flu and ultimately your businesses overall productivity. In the UK the decision whether to offer workplace based vaccinations to all adults is for a business to review knowing that the evidence suggests it does reduce the working days lost. It should also be noted that for workplace vaccinations to be effective a high percentage of individuals within the workplace need to be vaccinated to stop spread.

Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.",

Buy over-the-counter medicine to treat less serious ailments and consider using generic medicine which is cheaper but effective. What is Gap Cover? Gap cover is an insurance policy you can take out to help pay for the shortfall between what your medical scheme pays and what the hospital or specialist might charge. The amount paid out depends on your policy but most people usually combine Gap Cover with a hospital plan. It is important that note that Gap Cover is not offered by medical schemes and is a separate health insurance product. As of 1 April this year, the same requirements for a medical scheme have been introduced including a waiting period of between 3 and 12 months for certain conditions and payout limit of R150 000 a year for each person. And a hospital plan? This provides you with basic, yet important medical cover and essentially covers all your required in-hospital procedures and check-ups, including the 27 chronic conditions (or PMBs). However, a hospital plan does not provide cover for day-to-day doctors’ visits, prescribed medications, chronic medication and related expenses.Some hospital plans offer value-added benefits, so read the fine print, ask questions to make sure you are getting what need. ‘The best advice I can offer is to be informed,’says Van Emmenis. ‘Take the time to read the information and fine print, compare what the plans are actually offering. If you are unsure phone the scheme and ask questions, or check with your broker. Your health and that of your family is important so it is vital that you are comfortable with the choice you make and are confident your healthcare needs will be taken care of.’\nAll info was correct at time of publishing",

It is usually worse in the winter period and due to the way the virus can change or mutate it is different every year. People sometimes refer to a bad cold as flu, but having flu can be much worse and it may cause an individual to stay in bed for a few days. On some occasions seasonal flu can lead to serious disease and hospitalisation, and even death, especially in vulnerable individuals e.g. those who are immunocompromised, have chronic diseases or are pregnant. The flu vaccine protects against different flu viruses each year, and a prediction is made as to which types are most likely. This means that for the best protection you need to have a vaccine every year however it also means that the vaccine is not completely protective as some virus types can circulate that were not originally predicted. The vaccine has been shown to be very effective for high risk groups, children from 6 months to 18 years, and health care workers. The effectiveness of the vaccine can be difficult to properly assess but the estimates of the benefit range from 50-75% less chance of getting the flu each year. A bout of seasonal flu would undoubtedly cause an increase in absenteeism across your workplace impacting on those employees exposed to the virus, those who are covering colleagues that are absent from work with the flu and ultimately your businesses overall productivity. In the UK the decision whether to offer workplace based vaccinations to all adults is for a business to review knowing that the evidence suggests it does reduce the working days lost. It should also be noted that for workplace vaccinations to be effective a high percentage of individuals within the workplace need to be vaccinated to stop spread.
