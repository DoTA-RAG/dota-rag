While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year. Those are my favorites because they hold such wonderful memories.”\n\nThis Polish Pottery santa shaped jar (item number H3331K)\nis made by Manufaktura factory in Boleslawiec, Poland. is 12.6\" high and\nmeasures 6.9\" by 6.9\".

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nWhat is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces. Same day shipping in many cases, reward points and friendly customer service are just a few reasons to visit their store.\n\nSo what is Polish Pottery anyway? Polish pottery has been popping up all over the United States in recent years. It’s been featured in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens. You can find pieces in stores and online. But if you’ve never seen it before, you might be wondering just what exactly is so great about it. So here are 5 great reasons to check out polish pottery for yourself. 1) Polish Pottery is handmade. Polish Pottery is made by hand out of white clay found in Boleslawiec, Poland. The patterns are all hand stamped and\/or hand designed by local artists. This means that each piece is slightly different, which adds to the charm of the pottery. 2) There’s something for everyone. There are hundreds of patterns available in Polish Pottery. Everything from the traditional peacock eye pattern, to beautiful flower patterns. There are seasonal patterns too! Snowmen for Christmas, stars and stripes for 4th of July…you name it and they make it. 3) Durability. I use my Polish Pottery every day and it still looks beautiful. It’s microwave safe, oven safe, and dishwasher safe. It doesn’t chip easily, and it evenly distributes heat to your food. 4) The endless ability to mix and match. Remember those hundreds of patterns we talked about earlier, well you can mix and match them to your heart’s content. Many of the pieces feature similar colors, so they look great together on your table. Decide that you’re bored with stars and peacock eyes, you can always buy a few Blue Tulip or Blue Poppy patterns to mix in. Endless possibilities means endless fun! 5) It’s simply beautiful. If you’ve never seen it before, stop by our website (http:\/\/www.thepolishpotterygarden.com) and take a look at our inventory. It really does speak for itself.\n\nmaterial, design such as shape and style, etc. - its decorations, such as patterns, colors of patterns, slipped (glazing) or unslipped decoration\n- evidence of type of use. The Six fabrics of Kalibangan is a good example of fabric analysis. Body (or clay body) is a term for the main pottery form of a piece, underneath any glaze or decoration. The main ingredient of the body is clay. There are several materials that are referred to as clay. The properties which make them different include: Plasticity, the malleability of the body; the extent to which they will absorb water after firing; and shrinkage, the extent of reduction in size of a body as water is removed. Different clay bodies also differ in the way in which they respond when fired in the kiln. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Each of these different clays is composed of different types and amounts of minerals that determine the characteristics of resulting pottery. There can be regional variations in the properties of raw materials used for the production of pottery, and these can lead to wares that are unique in character to a locality. It is common for clays and other materials to be mixed to produce clay bodies suited to specific purposes. A common component of clay bodies is the mineral kaolinite. Other minerals in the clay, such as feldspar, act as fluxes which lower the vitrification temperature of bodies. Following is a list of different types of clay used for pottery. - Kaolin, is sometimes referred to as china clay because it was first used in China. Used for porcelain. - Ball clay: An extremely plastic, fine grained sedimentary clay, which may contain some organic matter. Small amounts can be added to porcelain bodies to increase plasticity. - Fire clay: A clay having a slightly lower percentage of fluxes than kaolin, but usually quite plastic. It is highly heat resistant form of clay which can be combined with other clays to increase the firing temperature and may be used as an ingredient to make stoneware type bodies. - Stoneware clay: Suitable for creating stoneware. Has many of the characteristics between fire clay and ball clay, having finer grain, like ball clay but is more heat resistant like fire clays. - Common red clay and shale clay have vegetable and ferric oxide impurities which make them useful for bricks, but are generally unsatisfactory for pottery except under special conditions of a particular deposit. - Bentonite: An extremely plastic clay which can be added in small quantities to short clay to increase the plasticity. Production of pottery includes following 3 stages:\n- making clay body, i.e. paste or putty. - shaping and moulding\n- firing or baking\n- decorating, such as glazing (slipping), paining, etc. Pottery can be shaped by a range of methods that include:\n- Hand-building: This is the earliest forming method. Wares can be constructed by hand from coils of clay, combining flat slabs of clay, or pinching solid balls of clay or some combination of these. Parts of hand-built vessels are often joined together with the aid of slip, an aqueous suspension of clay body and water. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared, such as tablewares, although some studio potters find hand-building more conducive to create one-of-a-kind works of art. - The potter's wheel: In a process called \"throwing\" (coming from the Old English word thrownاا which means to twist or turn, ) a ball of clay is placed in the center of a turntable, called the wheel-head, which the potter rotates with a stick, with foot power or with a variable-speed electric motor. - During the process of throwing, the wheel rotates while the solid ball of soft clay is pressed, squeezed and pulled gently upwards and outwards into a hollow shape.\n\nIdentifying unmarked pottery can be a chore. There is no single book or website that will always provide you with definitive answers. Amateur pottery owners or collectors have to correlate information from multiple sources in order to identify an unmarked piece of pottery. To do so, start with a few basic elements of the piece itself, and then turn to references or local experts who may be able to fill in the gaps. Things You'll Need\nLocal auction houses\nFlea markets or art markets\nPick up the piece and note the width of the clay in relation to the weight of the object. American pottery is often thicker than that of other countries and weighs more. Experts say that American pottery, for example, tends to have a \"heavy bottom.\" Native American pottery also often makes use of red and beige clays. Note the color of the clay in places that are unglazed. Frankoma pottery, for example, is made of red or pink clay, while Ada pottery sports yellow or beige clay. Narrow down the clay type and color, the weight of the piece and the color of the glaze. Come up with a couple of options for potential potters, and then use an online search engine to obtain more information and possible matches. Use phrases that are descriptive. Observe any designs painted on the piece itself. Moriage china, for example, often features pastel colors and intricate floral designs laid in with small ribbons of clay. A willow piece from China will picture a blue-and-white willow, orange or apple tree with two birds. It was possibly include a river, boats and people on a bridge. Use online commercial sites to look for sellers offering pieces similar to yours, since they may identify yours for you. Scout flea markets and art markets as well for other local people selling similar pieces who might be able to help you identify yours. Look at the bottom of your piece of pottery for a design that may indicate the pieces origin, even without the potter's name or the factory name. Indentations in the bottom of the piece, allowing it to sit flat, may also be indicative of its origin. Discoloration or specific coloring on the bottom of the piece may as well. Even with multiple sources, you may not end up finding a concrete origin for your piece of pottery.\n\nThe Uniqueness of Porcelain\nYou may be familiar with porcelain for a\nnumber of reasons. Whether it’s art or antiques or from one of its more\npractical uses the material has been around for centuries. What is Porcelain? Porcelain is a type of ceramic pottery that\nis primarily made from Kaolin, a paste made out of a clay mineral called\nKaolinite. After it is formed to the desired shape, it is baked in a kiln or\npottery baking oven, to harden and strengthen the clay. Due to the mineral\ncolor of the Kaolinite, most people are very familiar with porcelain’s white\nCreating something out of porcelain is a\nfour-step process. The four steps are forming, glazing, decorating and firing. Forming the porcelain creation is much the\nsame as any other ceramic or pottery. You can do it by hand or using a pottery\nwheel to shape it. Whichever way is chosen, the maker must remember porcelain\nis very sensitive to moisture in the creation stage so even a slight amount of\nmoisture may affect how easy or hard the Kaolin is to work with. Glazing is a common but not mandatory step\nof the porcelain-making process. Unlike other types of pottery, porcelain does\nnot need a glaze to make it waterproof. Glazing porcelain does make it dirt and\nstain resistant though. It also can create some amazing decorative effects when\nused in the right way. The next step is decorating. If the creator\nis using materials to decorate the porcelain that includes metals in the\npigments like copper or cobalt, the decorating needs to be done under the\nglaze. If they are using colored enamels, they would do the decorative\nflourishes over the glaze. The final step in the process is the\nfiring. This is baking the final product in a kiln until hardened. This will\npermanently set their shape as well as adhere to any glazing or decoration that\nhas gone on earlier in the process. This is generally done at a high heat. Most\nporcelain is fired at a range of 1,200 – 1,400 degrees Celsius or 2,200 – 2,600\nPorcelain can trace its history back to\nancient China. While no specific date can be found, it is believed porcelain\noriginated in the Shang Dynasty, which ruled China over 1,000 years BC. When the people of China started making\nthings out of porcelain, they found that they were harder, stronger and easier\nto clean than other types of pottery. They were also known for making\nbeautiful, ornate artworks out of porcelain and many of the most valuable and\nprized artifacts from that time were made for and owned by members of the\nruling dynasty of the day. Porcelain first made its way out of Asia\nand over to Europe thanks to the Italian merchant and explorer, Marco Polo. However, for years, European artisans tried and failed to reproduce the\nbeautiful porcelain creations they found to the East. It wasn’t unit Portuguese\nexplorers and traders in the 1500s actually brought back Kaolin that Europeans\nwere actually able to start producing it on their own. Once they understood how\nit was made, producers in Italy, France, and England all started making things\nfrom porcelain starting in the 1700s. is it used for? Other than art and sculptures, there are\nmany other uses for porcelain which is another reason why it is so highly\nvalued. From your home to more industrial uses, there are many ways the\ninteresting properties of porcelain are put to work. The most well-known use to people nowadays\nis for “the Porcelain Throne”, as it is nicknamed, nor the toilet as it is\nbetter known. Porcelain has been used in all type of bathroom fixtures for\nyears. The fact that it doesn’t rust when exposed to water and moisture coupled\nwith the fact that it is durable and easy to clean made it a perfect fit for\nYou can also find it in the kitchen. When\nyou hear people talk about their ‘fine China” or “bone China” dishware, that is\na type of porcelain. It has been used for centuries to make all sorts of things\nto serve and eat off of. Bowls, plates, cups and tea sets are some of the most\ncommon porcelain crockeries you’ll find in a kitchen or dining room cabinet. A\ncommon misconception is that porcelain dinnerware is more breakable than other\ntypes.","passages":[{"passage":"This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

The Six fabrics of Kalibangan is a good example of fabric analysis. Body (or clay body) is a term for the main pottery form of a piece, underneath any glaze or decoration. The main ingredient of the body is clay. There are several materials that are referred to as clay. The properties which make them different include: Plasticity, the malleability of the body; the extent to which they will absorb water after firing; and shrinkage, the extent of reduction in size of a body as water is removed. Different clay bodies also differ in the way in which they respond when fired in the kiln. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Each of these different clays is composed of different types and amounts of minerals that determine the characteristics of resulting pottery. There can be regional variations in the properties of raw materials used for the production of pottery, and these can lead to wares that are unique in character to a locality. It is common for clays and other materials to be mixed to produce clay bodies suited to specific purposes. A common component of clay bodies is the mineral kaolinite. Other minerals in the clay, such as feldspar, act as fluxes which lower the vitrification temperature of bodies. Following is a list of different types of clay used for pottery. - Kaolin, is sometimes referred to as china clay because it was first used in China. Used for porcelain. - Ball clay: An extremely plastic, fine grained sedimentary clay, which may contain some organic matter. Small amounts can be added to porcelain bodies to increase plasticity. - Fire clay: A clay having a slightly lower percentage of fluxes than kaolin, but usually quite plastic. It is highly heat resistant form of clay which can be combined with other clays to increase the firing temperature and may be used as an ingredient to make stoneware type bodies. - Stoneware clay: Suitable for creating stoneware. Has many of the characteristics between fire clay and ball clay, having finer grain, like ball clay but is more heat resistant like fire clays. - Common red clay and shale clay have vegetable and ferric oxide impurities which make them useful for bricks, but are generally unsatisfactory for pottery except under special conditions of a particular deposit. - Bentonite: An extremely plastic clay which can be added in small quantities to short clay to increase the plasticity. Production of pottery includes following 3 stages:\n- making clay body, i.e. paste or putty. - shaping and moulding\n- firing or baking\n- decorating, such as glazing (slipping), paining, etc. Pottery can be shaped by a range of methods that include:\n- Hand-building: This is the earliest forming method. Wares can be constructed by hand from coils of clay, combining flat slabs of clay, or pinching solid balls of clay or some combination of these. Parts of hand-built vessels are often joined together with the aid of slip, an aqueous suspension of clay body and water. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared, such as tablewares, although some studio potters find hand-building more conducive to create one-of-a-kind works of art. - The potter's wheel: In a process called \"throwing\" (coming from the Old English word thrownاا which means to twist or turn, ) a ball of clay is placed in the center of a turntable, called the wheel-head, which the potter rotates with a stick, with foot power or with a variable-speed electric motor. - During the process of throwing, the wheel rotates while the solid ball of soft clay is pressed, squeezed and pulled gently upwards and outwards into a hollow shape.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3fc6b15f-c3b5-4b3f-8c6f-bbf05a84d024>"]},{"passage":"Identifying unmarked pottery can be a chore. There is no single book or website that will always provide you with definitive answers. Amateur pottery owners or collectors have to correlate information from multiple sources in order to identify an unmarked piece of pottery. To do so, start with a few basic elements of the piece itself, and then turn to references or local experts who may be able to fill in the gaps. Things You'll Need\nLocal auction houses\nFlea markets or art markets\nPick up the piece and note the width of the clay in relation to the weight of the object. American pottery is often thicker than that of other countries and weighs more. Experts say that American pottery, for example, tends to have a \"heavy bottom.\" Native American pottery also often makes use of red and beige clays. Note the color of the clay in places that are unglazed. Frankoma pottery, for example, is made of red or pink clay, while Ada pottery sports yellow or beige clay. Narrow down the clay type and color, the weight of the piece and the color of the glaze. Come up with a couple of options for potential potters, and then use an online search engine to obtain more information and possible matches. Use phrases that are descriptive. Observe any designs painted on the piece itself. Moriage china, for example, often features pastel colors and intricate floral designs laid in with small ribbons of clay. A willow piece from China will picture a blue-and-white willow, orange or apple tree with two birds. It was possibly include a river, boats and people on a bridge. Use online commercial sites to look for sellers offering pieces similar to yours, since they may identify yours for you. Scout flea markets and art markets as well for other local people selling similar pieces who might be able to help you identify yours. Look at the bottom of your piece of pottery for a design that may indicate the pieces origin, even without the potter's name or the factory name. Indentations in the bottom of the piece, allowing it to sit flat, may also be indicative of its origin. Discoloration or specific coloring on the bottom of the piece may as well.

Whether it’s art or antiques or from one of its more\npractical uses the material has been around for centuries. What is Porcelain? Porcelain is a type of ceramic pottery that\nis primarily made from Kaolin, a paste made out of a clay mineral called\nKaolinite. After it is formed to the desired shape, it is baked in a kiln or\npottery baking oven, to harden and strengthen the clay. Due to the mineral\ncolor of the Kaolinite, most people are very familiar with porcelain’s white\nCreating something out of porcelain is a\nfour-step process. The four steps are forming, glazing, decorating and firing. Forming the porcelain creation is much the\nsame as any other ceramic or pottery. You can do it by hand or using a pottery\nwheel to shape it. Whichever way is chosen, the maker must remember porcelain\nis very sensitive to moisture in the creation stage so even a slight amount of\nmoisture may affect how easy or hard the Kaolin is to work with. Glazing is a common but not mandatory step\nof the porcelain-making process. Unlike other types of pottery, porcelain does\nnot need a glaze to make it waterproof. Glazing porcelain does make it dirt and\nstain resistant though. It also can create some amazing decorative effects when\nused in the right way. The next step is decorating. If the creator\nis using materials to decorate the porcelain that includes metals in the\npigments like copper or cobalt, the decorating needs to be done under the\nglaze. If they are using colored enamels, they would do the decorative\nflourishes over the glaze. The final step in the process is the\nfiring. This is baking the final product in a kiln until hardened. This will\npermanently set their shape as well as adhere to any glazing or decoration that\nhas gone on earlier in the process. This is generally done at a high heat. Most\nporcelain is fired at a range of 1,200 – 1,400 degrees Celsius or 2,200 – 2,600\nPorcelain can trace its history back to\nancient China. While no specific date can be found, it is believed porcelain\noriginated in the Shang Dynasty, which ruled China over 1,000 years BC. When the people of China started making\nthings out of porcelain, they found that they were harder, stronger and easier\nto clean than other types of pottery. They were also known for making\nbeautiful, ornate artworks out of porcelain and many of the most valuable and\nprized artifacts from that time were made for and owned by members of the\nruling dynasty of the day. Porcelain first made its way out of Asia\nand over to Europe thanks to the Italian merchant and explorer, Marco Polo. However, for years, European artisans tried and failed to reproduce the\nbeautiful porcelain creations they found to the East. It wasn’t unit Portuguese\nexplorers and traders in the 1500s actually brought back Kaolin that Europeans\nwere actually able to start producing it on their own. Once they understood how\nit was made, producers in Italy, France, and England all started making things\nfrom porcelain starting in the 1700s. is it used for? Other than art and sculptures, there are\nmany other uses for porcelain which is another reason why it is so highly\nvalued. From your home to more industrial uses, there are many ways the\ninteresting properties of porcelain are put to work. The most well-known use to people nowadays\nis for “the Porcelain Throne”, as it is nicknamed, nor the toilet as it is\nbetter known. Porcelain has been used in all type of bathroom fixtures for\nyears.

That's why even master photographers have a hard time getting it right. However, there are strategies that can help photographers capture the images they want, in the way they want. Of course, nothing can be perfected without practice. With enough time and effort, these tips should help you become an expert at aerial photography. Plus, these tips will make the process a little easier than usual. Go higher, but keep it below 400 feet\nIt is natural for photographers to get close to their target in order to get a proper shot. However, with aerial photography, the trick is to move to a higher altitude. This allows photographers to cover a much wider angle and results in a better picture. For instance, you can capture a field with the horses running and zoom into the horses as well. You gain the option of choosing between a more detailed close-up shot or a wider shot that covers all elements within the setting. Some drones come with the option of capturing images in First Person View. However, this will require some experimentation before you start to get things right. The key lies in knowing when to use FPV and when not to. This helps pictures come out much better. For instance, FPV works well with high range shots, while close up shots can turn out to be poor. Some drones come with a GPS mode and this helps with stabilization. All you have to do is choose your location and let the drone do the rest. Once the location is reached the GPS will stabilize over it automatically. This will give you enough time to get a perfect shot. Use a Gimbal\nAerial photography is best achieved with a gimbal. A gimbal is pivot support that allows objects to revolve around a single axis. This might be expensive, but, it will definitely allow you to capture images with a high level of precision. For instance, the gimbal will allow you to focus on a subject, while compensating for the flight's motion. However, gimbals are ideally meant for professional photographers. So, if you happen to be a professional photographer who does projects for real estate clients, it would be a smart move to carry out aerial photography with a gimbal. However, gimbals can turn out to be heavy for certain drones, so be careful when you're making a buying decision. Composition is the key\nAerial photography works the same as regular photography. The same rules apply here too. So, follow the \"rule of thirds\" here as well. What that means is you need to place your subject away from the centre to get unique images. You can experiment with leading lines to draw the viewer towards the subject. With some drones, clicking images may not come out right, especially if the drone happens to be a more pocket friendly model. In that case, it is better to record HD or 4K videos. You can then choose the images you like by capturing stills from the video. That way you won't miss anything and also, get the best shots possible. Each camera is different, make sure you know all the camera settings. If you are going to shoot in auto mode, lock your white balance. For best continuous results use manual mode but shutter-priority & aperture-priority works well too. Keep experimenting with the resolution, frame rate, or zoom to find out what works best for you. Use the right lens\nIf you are using a camera with an interchangeable lens feature, try to using something like a wide angle lens or a prime lens. This will help you stabilize the shot. Only use a zoom lens if you can control the zoom remotely, you will definitely need a gimbal with zoom lenses. Also, make sure your shutter speed is high in order to prevent blurring and shoot under good light. Well, there you have it – tips to boost your aerial photography skills. Make sure you put them into practice to get the best results.\n\nPost new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india?

Even before the eruption, Iceland was a feast for drone pilots who would come from all over the world looking for stunning content for their Instagram feed, and they would not leave disappointed. You might be planning to do the same? Honestly, who could blame you? So, you are probably wondering what the rules are regarding safety and where you can fly freely? Well, look no further, here is a useful guide regarding flying a drone in Iceland. Which Areas are Safe for Flying a Drone in Iceland? The great news is that, when it comes to flying a drone in Iceland, you may do so freely in most parts of the country. However, as with everywhere, there are certain rules are regulations concerning safe and legal drone use. So, it is best to be prepared. Here are the main rules to follow\nIf you plan to fly for commercial purposes, then you need to register your drone. If its just for fun, then no need to worry! Your drone must weigh no more than 3kg in urban areas, and no more then 25kg in rural areas. You are permitted to fly your drone no more than 120 meters from the ground.You cannot fly any closed than 2km to the international airport, and no more than 1.5km to any other airport in the country. Please ensure that you fly no closer than 150 meters to public and private buildings in rural areas with express permission from the property owner. Also, please ensure you do not fly any closer than 150 meters to public buildings and 50 km to private buildings in urban areas without permission from the property owner. Never fly over crowds of people\nNever disturb wildlife with your drone. Animals such as birds, horses, seals, reindeer, etc are to be left to behave naturally. Drones can be frightening to them, and can cause panicked and unnatural behaviour. Drone flights in all national parks, protected areas, nature reserves and monuments are not permitted. These areas include Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg, Hornstrandir, Geysir, Gullfoss, etc.For commercial drone photography, you can apply for an exemption permit to some of the restrictions mentioned above. Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks\nThe national parks of Iceland are off limits for drone use, except on special circumstances. The same is also true for many protected areas of interest around the country. The reason for this is to protect fragile and sensitive nature, animal life and for the safety and enjoyment of other people. For example, places such as Skógafoss waterfall, Dyrhólaey nature reserve and Látrabjarg have a protected status because of nesting birds. The use of drones can disturb the birds and can lead to eggs or chicks being abandoned. This can then lead to a reduction in numbers. There are also many seal colonies around Iceland, and areas that seals simply like to visit, such as Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Drones can drive them away from these areas, and they may never return if they do not feel safe. Skógafoss is a very tempting place to film with your drone, and if you film from the left of the waterfall then this is perfectly fine, but once you encroach on the monument area then drones are not permitted. Can I Get Special Permission for Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks? Yes, you can. Provided your footage is to be used for commercial purposes. You can apply for a special permit, where you can discuss your plans. Upon granting of a permit, you will receive expert guidance on where you can fly, at what time of day, etc. You can apply to for a permit in Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park and you can also apply to the Environment Agency of Iceland for permission to fly in Snæfellsjökull National Park and all other protected areas that require a permit. They also have lots of useful information about these areas that you should read before you fly. Can I Fly my Drone in Reykjavík and Other Towns? According to the regulations, flying in the city of Reyjkjavík and other towns is not permitted unless you have special permission. The reason for this is because flying to close to airports, as well as public and private property is not permitted under Icelandic law.\n\nAt the end of the day, move the footage you’ve collected onto the tablet and use the external hard drive (or two) as your secondary backup. This protects the footage you have collected without worrying about access to WiFi or other services. Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges.

Gary started drone photography over a year ago because of his desire for everything new and evolutionary. “I am forever trying new things with photography and the evolution of drone technology brought something to the table. I want to give a different perspective, to tell a new story,” Gary says. Gary shared with us tips and secrets on getting started with drone photography. To see Gary’s amazing work, follow him on Instagram. Drone photography tips by Gary Cummins\n1. Choose a drone with the best camera\nWhen choosing a drone, I wanted the best image quality. Most drones have similar operating methods, so from a beginner’s standpoint it doesn’t really matter which one you choose. If you want the best image and video quality, you should choose the drone with the best camera. For a better experience, choose a drone with a user-friendly UI, high stability to handle strong winds, and an option to take high-resolution images. Currently, I have a Mavic 2 Pro drone. I recently switched from the Phantom 4 Pro, as the Mavic is a better drone to travel with due to its size. 2. Get prepared\nRead your drone’s manual and make sure you know what your drone can and cannot do. It can take a few attempts to get comfortable with operating the drone. Watch tutorials on YouTube and take your time getting used to how it moves and reacts. Safety and care is the number one priority. 3. Learn drone regulations\nBefore you launch your drone, surf the web for the drone regulations in your country. For example, in the United States, drones weighing between 0.55 and 55 pounds need to be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There are also regulations on where you can’t fly your drone. There are many drone forums where you can find up-to-date information about local drone regulations. 4. Check the UAV forecast\nBefore going out, check the UAV forecast for your safety. It will tell you about off-limit areas, weather, active GPS satellites within a particular area, and more. When choosing weather, calm and sunny days are best. This allows safe flying and optimum performance. Avoid flying if there’s any chance of rain, as water and drones don't get along. 5. Research what you’re going to shoot\nI like to research an area and find unique places to shoot. I use Google Earth to scout for unique locations. It has amazing image quality and a search tool for almost the entire planet. Instagram is also great for inspiration. I try to tell a different story when using my drone. A new angle that hasn't been seen before is my goal. The whole world opens up when using a drone for photo and video. The possibilities are endless. 6. Consider the scene\nThere are many composition techniques you might want to try with your drone: symmetry and patterns, wide-open shots, lines, shadows, and more. For me, it depends on where I’m shooting. Out in nature, I like wide open shots as I want to get as much of the scene as possible. In cities I like lines and different perspectives such as top-down shots, condensing a scene. 7. Shoot RAW\nI always shoot RAW and can only recommend that you shoot RAW too. It’s the best way to get the most from your photos. Not only does it offer maximum file size, it also retains more information than JPEG so the ability to recover highlights and shadows is far greater. 8. Shoot to the conditions\nCamera settings are as important as composition. Most of today’s drones have an adjustable aperture and shutter speed with variable ISO values. During the daytime, lighting shouldn’t be a problem, so you can stick to the lowest possible ISO. This means you’ll have to manually adjust your camera settings to keep your images properly exposed. When shooting in windy or shady places, consider opening up your aperture or using a slower shutter speed. It will let in more light and maintain the lowest ISO for clean, sharp images. The best settings for aerial photos depend on the lighting conditions and where you’re located.

But recently, no-fly zones have begun to sprout up all over the landscape. More and more urban areas and national parks have begun to enforce these zones (enforced via locational ‘geo-fencing’ software I might add, rather than the more exciting prospects of miniaturized air-aircraft batteries or dogfights with specially trained albatrosses), so it’s important to check before setting out to avoid disappointment. Just because you’ve flown there before doesn’t mean things will still be the same, for example, the city where we are now based has changed its no fly zones at least 3 times in the past year, going from a free for all, to a complete ban, to now restricted flying zones just around the city centre and the university campus. You can usually find updated maps online, or through your drone software. So check carefully, and as close as possible to the time of your visit. Plan your drone locations and shots beforehand\nBy Charmaine from LuvMiHome.com\nMake a list of the drone locations you are interested in beforehand. You can use tools such as Google earth to scout your locations and find interesting angles. This will give you an idea of what your location looks like from the air as well as the ground. You will also need to consider what altitude works best for your location. Don’t be afraid to try different altitudes and angles of your target to get the best possible shot. Lighting is an important factor; you will need to figure out the direction of the light during different times of the day and select the appropriate time. Lastly make sure you fly your drone in good weather; snow, rain and wind can be a menace to your drone. Be wary or avoid flying over crowds\nBy Lexi from A Scenic Find\nI’ve seen a few drop out of the sky (mine included), so I’m always super careful about where I fly them. The best places to fly them are in open fields, beaches or anywhere where crowds are sparse. It’s so easy to think of them as toys, but they can and do malfunction mid flight occasionally. I’ve had one of mine drop out of the sky into a lake due to a technical error, since then I’ve always been super strict about where I fly if there are crowds around. Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nIf you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nWhen you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling\nBy Christa from Expedition Wildlife\nMake sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone. We recommend purchasing a tablet, or other lightweight and easily packable device, and an external hard drive to use as a storage space and transfer mechanism for your footage.\n\nIf the pictures and cinematography team are the an identical people to cover your marriage ceremony, it can doubtless be a very good different to get together with them as correctly. Both drone photography and flicks are scorching right now so that you simply’re into photography or taking movies, they might also help you elevate your art work to the next stage. The perfect drones in the marketplace in the marketplace at better at this, they enable photographers and videographers to take first-specific individual aerial footage or footage from angles that will normally be unattainable. If you wish to get blurriness free image, then it is advisable to use a tripod. A tripod helps you to get a consistency picture shoot.\n\nThe art of photography has grown greatly. From those old pictures that were black and white and some images were even blurred to what the modern society has, which is defined through clarity and detail, the art of photography has certainly suffered great changes. Actually, so grand have the modifications been that today, people have something called aerial photography to refer to. Although the entire technique seems to be specific for the modern society, it is worth knowing that this people made use of aerial photography in 1858. The first person to have taken photos from impressive heights was balloonist Gaspard-Félix Tournachon. If you want to get an idea of how aerial photos looked like back in the 1850s, then you could look at one of the vintage postcards, because this is how this technique functioned. Of course today, things have changed greatly and photos taken in this manner, as well videos performed through aerial cinematography. Much has been invested in the development of the right technology and for good reason. It is truly surprising to see all the ways one can make use of aerial filming, as well cinematography. Here are a few examples of domains, which have a constant need for these techniques that will surely convince you of the fact that investing money in this direction is a very profitable plan. Aerial photos are relevant in the making of topographic maps, archeology, movies and commercial, even in the promotion of certain location for touristic purposes. Looking at the environmental concerns, which are increasing in number, it is relevant to mention that indeed aerial filming can be used in different related analysis. So far, anyone can tell that such photographing techniques are needed, making possible for several tasks to be handled appropriately. However, what might seem as a mystery to most is the actual manner in which these photos are taken. In some cases, this is performed by means of a highly equipped, professional camera, handled by an expert, situated in a plane. Still, there are some photos that present locations, which are impossible to enter by means of a plane. This certainly leads to the following question: how were these photos actually taken? Well, at this point, you have to allow your imagination to fly, because this is what scientists did for a brief moment and came up with the following method. They have managed to develop plenty of platforms that can be used to take surprising pictures. Some are controlled drones. These are actually small devices on which a photo or filming camera is place, its mission being to enter some of the hardest to reach locations and take photos or make videos. Of course out of the many photos such a device can take, the photographer will start editing the pictures, to give them a proper professional appearance and the final result to be the expected one. Thanks to technology, the world has changed greatly and in some areas for the better. When it comes aerial photography and filming, much can be said, but the bottom line is that it can lead to spectacular results.","passages":[{"passage":"Aerial photography is something that takes time to get used to. That's why even master photographers have a hard time getting it right. However, there are strategies that can help photographers capture the images they want, in the way they want. Of course, nothing can be perfected without practice. With enough time and effort, these tips should help you become an expert at aerial photography. Plus, these tips will make the process a little easier than usual. Go higher, but keep it below 400 feet\nIt is natural for photographers to get close to their target in order to get a proper shot. However, with aerial photography, the trick is to move to a higher altitude. This allows photographers to cover a much wider angle and results in a better picture. For instance, you can capture a field with the horses running and zoom into the horses as well. You gain the option of choosing between a more detailed close-up shot or a wider shot that covers all elements within the setting. Some drones come with the option of capturing images in First Person View. However, this will require some experimentation before you start to get things right. The key lies in knowing when to use FPV and when not to. This helps pictures come out much better. For instance, FPV works well with high range shots, while close up shots can turn out to be poor. Some drones come with a GPS mode and this helps with stabilization. All you have to do is choose your location and let the drone do the rest. Once the location is reached the GPS will stabilize over it automatically. This will give you enough time to get a perfect shot. Use a Gimbal\nAerial photography is best achieved with a gimbal. A gimbal is pivot support that allows objects to revolve around a single axis. This might be expensive, but, it will definitely allow you to capture images with a high level of precision. For instance, the gimbal will allow you to focus on a subject, while compensating for the flight's motion. However, gimbals are ideally meant for professional photographers. So, if you happen to be a professional photographer who does projects for real estate clients, it would be a smart move to carry out aerial photography with a gimbal. However, gimbals can turn out to be heavy for certain drones, so be careful when you're making a buying decision. Composition is the key\nAerial photography works the same as regular photography. The same rules apply here too. So, follow the \"rule of thirds\" here as well. What that means is you need to place your subject away from the centre to get unique images. You can experiment with leading lines to draw the viewer towards the subject. With some drones, clicking images may not come out right, especially if the drone happens to be a more pocket friendly model. In that case, it is better to record HD or 4K videos. You can then choose the images you like by capturing stills from the video. That way you won't miss anything and also, get the best shots possible. Each camera is different, make sure you know all the camera settings. If you are going to shoot in auto mode, lock your white balance. For best continuous results use manual mode but shutter-priority & aperture-priority works well too. Keep experimenting with the resolution, frame rate, or zoom to find out what works best for you. Use the right lens\nIf you are using a camera with an interchangeable lens feature, try to using something like a wide angle lens or a prime lens. This will help you stabilize the shot. Only use a zoom lens if you can control the zoom remotely, you will definitely need a gimbal with zoom lenses. Also, make sure your shutter speed is high in order to prevent blurring and shoot under good light. Well, there you have it – tips to boost your aerial photography skills. Make sure you put them into practice to get the best results.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8eb853ae-1fef-4eb5-ad30-8c9a739961e5>"]},{"passage":"Post new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india?

Even before the eruption, Iceland was a feast for drone pilots who would come from all over the world looking for stunning content for their Instagram feed, and they would not leave disappointed. You might be planning to do the same? Honestly, who could blame you? So, you are probably wondering what the rules are regarding safety and where you can fly freely? Well, look no further, here is a useful guide regarding flying a drone in Iceland. Which Areas are Safe for Flying a Drone in Iceland? The great news is that, when it comes to flying a drone in Iceland, you may do so freely in most parts of the country. However, as with everywhere, there are certain rules are regulations concerning safe and legal drone use. So, it is best to be prepared. Here are the main rules to follow\nIf you plan to fly for commercial purposes, then you need to register your drone. If its just for fun, then no need to worry! Your drone must weigh no more than 3kg in urban areas, and no more then 25kg in rural areas. You are permitted to fly your drone no more than 120 meters from the ground.You cannot fly any closed than 2km to the international airport, and no more than 1.5km to any other airport in the country. Please ensure that you fly no closer than 150 meters to public and private buildings in rural areas with express permission from the property owner. Also, please ensure you do not fly any closer than 150 meters to public buildings and 50 km to private buildings in urban areas without permission from the property owner. Never fly over crowds of people\nNever disturb wildlife with your drone. Animals such as birds, horses, seals, reindeer, etc are to be left to behave naturally. Drones can be frightening to them, and can cause panicked and unnatural behaviour. Drone flights in all national parks, protected areas, nature reserves and monuments are not permitted. These areas include Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg, Hornstrandir, Geysir, Gullfoss, etc.For commercial drone photography, you can apply for an exemption permit to some of the restrictions mentioned above. Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks\nThe national parks of Iceland are off limits for drone use, except on special circumstances. The same is also true for many protected areas of interest around the country. The reason for this is to protect fragile and sensitive nature, animal life and for the safety and enjoyment of other people. For example, places such as Skógafoss waterfall, Dyrhólaey nature reserve and Látrabjarg have a protected status because of nesting birds. The use of drones can disturb the birds and can lead to eggs or chicks being abandoned. This can then lead to a reduction in numbers. There are also many seal colonies around Iceland, and areas that seals simply like to visit, such as Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Drones can drive them away from these areas, and they may never return if they do not feel safe. Skógafoss is a very tempting place to film with your drone, and if you film from the left of the waterfall then this is perfectly fine, but once you encroach on the monument area then drones are not permitted. Can I Get Special Permission for Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks? Yes, you can. Provided your footage is to be used for commercial purposes. You can apply for a special permit, where you can discuss your plans. Upon granting of a permit, you will receive expert guidance on where you can fly, at what time of day, etc. You can apply to for a permit in Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park and you can also apply to the Environment Agency of Iceland for permission to fly in Snæfellsjökull National Park and all other protected areas that require a permit. They also have lots of useful information about these areas that you should read before you fly. Can I Fly my Drone in Reykjavík and Other Towns? According to the regulations, flying in the city of Reyjkjavík and other towns is not permitted unless you have special permission. The reason for this is because flying to close to airports, as well as public and private property is not permitted under Icelandic law.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b6a729be-5161-476d-b9a5-cfe13005cd2f>"]},{"passage":"At the end of the day, move the footage you’ve collected onto the tablet and use the external hard drive (or two) as your secondary backup. This protects the footage you have collected without worrying about access to WiFi or other services. Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges.

Gary started drone photography over a year ago because of his desire for everything new and evolutionary. “I am forever trying new things with photography and the evolution of drone technology brought something to the table. I want to give a different perspective, to tell a new story,” Gary says. Gary shared with us tips and secrets on getting started with drone photography. To see Gary’s amazing work, follow him on Instagram. Drone photography tips by Gary Cummins\n1. Choose a drone with the best camera\nWhen choosing a drone, I wanted the best image quality. Most drones have similar operating methods, so from a beginner’s standpoint it doesn’t really matter which one you choose. If you want the best image and video quality, you should choose the drone with the best camera. For a better experience, choose a drone with a user-friendly UI, high stability to handle strong winds, and an option to take high-resolution images. Currently, I have a Mavic 2 Pro drone. I recently switched from the Phantom 4 Pro, as the Mavic is a better drone to travel with due to its size. 2. Get prepared\nRead your drone’s manual and make sure you know what your drone can and cannot do. It can take a few attempts to get comfortable with operating the drone. Watch tutorials on YouTube and take your time getting used to how it moves and reacts. Safety and care is the number one priority. 3. Learn drone regulations\nBefore you launch your drone, surf the web for the drone regulations in your country. For example, in the United States, drones weighing between 0.55 and 55 pounds need to be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There are also regulations on where you can’t fly your drone. There are many drone forums where you can find up-to-date information about local drone regulations. 4. Check the UAV forecast\nBefore going out, check the UAV forecast for your safety. It will tell you about off-limit areas, weather, active GPS satellites within a particular area, and more. When choosing weather, calm and sunny days are best. This allows safe flying and optimum performance. Avoid flying if there’s any chance of rain, as water and drones don't get along. 5. Research what you’re going to shoot\nI like to research an area and find unique places to shoot. I use Google Earth to scout for unique locations. It has amazing image quality and a search tool for almost the entire planet. Instagram is also great for inspiration. I try to tell a different story when using my drone. A new angle that hasn't been seen before is my goal. The whole world opens up when using a drone for photo and video. The possibilities are endless. 6. Consider the scene\nThere are many composition techniques you might want to try with your drone: symmetry and patterns, wide-open shots, lines, shadows, and more. For me, it depends on where I’m shooting. Out in nature, I like wide open shots as I want to get as much of the scene as possible. In cities I like lines and different perspectives such as top-down shots, condensing a scene. 7. Shoot RAW\nI always shoot RAW and can only recommend that you shoot RAW too. It’s the best way to get the most from your photos. Not only does it offer maximum file size, it also retains more information than JPEG so the ability to recover highlights and shadows is far greater. 8. Shoot to the conditions\nCamera settings are as important as composition. Most of today’s drones have an adjustable aperture and shutter speed with variable ISO values. During the daytime, lighting shouldn’t be a problem, so you can stick to the lowest possible ISO. This means you’ll have to manually adjust your camera settings to keep your images properly exposed. When shooting in windy or shady places, consider opening up your aperture or using a slower shutter speed. It will let in more light and maintain the lowest ISO for clean, sharp images. The best settings for aerial photos depend on the lighting conditions and where you’re located. Shoot to the conditions and you’ll find what works.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9fd7e92e-e139-4161-aa15-4d9e6a9e3681>"]},{"passage":"Go-Pro Video shot in a Recliner Disappoints\nAction seems to be the cornerstone of Go-Pro Videos, like the ones my niece and nephews make while skiing or snowboarding.

Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nIf you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nWhen you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling\nBy Christa from Expedition Wildlife\nMake sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone. We recommend purchasing a tablet, or other lightweight and easily packable device, and an external hard drive to use as a storage space and transfer mechanism for your footage.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:00a6ffbf-5816-4801-91a8-1bcc056ffc6b>"]},{"passage":"If the pictures and cinematography team are the an identical people to cover your marriage ceremony, it can doubtless be a very good different to get together with them as correctly.

From those old pictures that were black and white and some images were even blurred to what the modern society has, which is defined through clarity and detail, the art of photography has certainly suffered great changes. Actually, so grand have the modifications been that today, people have something called aerial photography to refer to. Although the entire technique seems to be specific for the modern society, it is worth knowing that this people made use of aerial photography in 1858. The first person to have taken photos from impressive heights was balloonist Gaspard-Félix Tournachon. If you want to get an idea of how aerial photos looked like back in the 1850s, then you could look at one of the vintage postcards, because this is how this technique functioned. Of course today, things have changed greatly and photos taken in this manner, as well videos performed through aerial cinematography. Much has been invested in the development of the right technology and for good reason. It is truly surprising to see all the ways one can make use of aerial filming, as well cinematography. Here are a few examples of domains, which have a constant need for these techniques that will surely convince you of the fact that investing money in this direction is a very profitable plan. Aerial photos are relevant in the making of topographic maps, archeology, movies and commercial, even in the promotion of certain location for touristic purposes. Looking at the environmental concerns, which are increasing in number, it is relevant to mention that indeed aerial filming can be used in different related analysis. So far, anyone can tell that such photographing techniques are needed, making possible for several tasks to be handled appropriately. However, what might seem as a mystery to most is the actual manner in which these photos are taken. In some cases, this is performed by means of a highly equipped, professional camera, handled by an expert, situated in a plane. Still, there are some photos that present locations, which are impossible to enter by means of a plane. This certainly leads to the following question: how were these photos actually taken? Well, at this point, you have to allow your imagination to fly, because this is what scientists did for a brief moment and came up with the following method. They have managed to develop plenty of platforms that can be used to take surprising pictures. Some are controlled drones. These are actually small devices on which a photo or filming camera is place, its mission being to enter some of the hardest to reach locations and take photos or make videos. Of course out of the many photos such a device can take, the photographer will start editing the pictures, to give them a proper professional appearance and the final result to be the expected one. Thanks to technology, the world has changed greatly and in some areas for the better. When it comes aerial photography and filming, much can be said, but the bottom line is that it can lead to spectacular results.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:079849dd-5f3e-4428-bf24-c8268a782969>"]}]}

It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.\n\nGetting Started With Inventory Management\nE-Commerce page websites have greatly contributed to the retailing industry now! with a lot of consumers preferring to shop via online space website.

Don’t deprive your business of the benefits of inventory management and start doing it today!\n\n5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.\n\nSo, you’ve started your own business. Congrats! You must have a pretty overwhelming to-do list on your hands right about now, and managing your inventory is probably close to the top. Because most start-ups don’t have the cash to splash on an inventory-managing robot, we thought we’d share some advice on how to manage and organise your own inventory. Invest in Organisational Shelves and Products\nYes, cardboard boxes are great. And bags are handy too. But when it comes to your inventory, you need to take it up a notch to keep things organised and easy to find. If your small business or online store is blossoming from your spare room or garage, consider installing shelves and drawers for your stock. Then grab yourself a labeller to mark out certain spaces for certain products. Things will have their own designated place and you’ll be able to grab what you need without rustling through boxes and bags on the ground. Implement a Logical Layout\nSo the pink dog raincoats are flying out the door. But the green ones? Not so much. Take your product demand and turnover into account when organising a layout for your inventory. Put simply, you should keep stuff you always need (or frequently sell) at the front of your shelves or the top of your drawers, and stuff you don’t often need at the back or bottom. This will make your daily operations more efficient and make you 78%* less likely to split your pants while squatting down to grab stuff each day. *Totally fabricated statistic. National Storage cannot be held liable for any split pants. There really is an app for everything (there’s even one to train your bird to talk), and there’s no exception when it comes to getting your inventory on track. Try these helpful apps to keep your stock organised. $4.49 | Available on iPhone and iPad\nThis handy app is a lifesaver when it comes to tracking your inventory. When you buy new stock, you tell the app. As you receive, sell, ship and deliver items, you let the app know. This allows you to see everything in your inventory, their statuses, and your profits whenever you want. Inventory Now provides a simple stock overview that doesn’t leave you scratching your head and reaching for a calculator. $4.99 | Available on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch\nSave money on dud stock by keeping an eye on sales trends with this app. On Shelf tells you what items are in stock and what items need reordering, and the barcode feature allows you to enter sales in a flash. If you want to know which items sell and which items you shouldn’t bother with, On Shelf is your guy. Or girl. At this point in time, we don’t know what gender – if any – On Shelf identifies as. Use A Self-Storage Unit\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again – there really is nothing National Storage can’t do (except juggle; that is bloody tricky). Starting a business is also tricky, especially when it comes to finding a home for all your growing paperwork and inventory. If keeping boxes of files and stock in your garage isn’t really working for you, our business storage is the perfect solution. Some of our centres even offer a records management service for those of you who are feeling extra lazy. Just kidding! It really does take a lot of work off your hands, though. We’re considerate like that.\n\nBecause inventories are often a sizable investment, they require careful management. But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.\n\nSound inventory management techniques are the foundation for strategic procurement, enabling you to:\nChoosing the right inventory management processes that suit your dental practice is not a simple task, and the more your business grows, the more difficult managing your inventory can be.

Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.","passages":[{"passage":"Are you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:31ac7c02-c97c-4d91-bd63-2eef3918c997>"]},{"passage":"Getting Started With Inventory Management\nE-Commerce page websites have greatly contributed to the retailing industry now! with a lot of consumers preferring to shop via online space website.

View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider.

Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:198c1140-04e3-4e42-9556-c7be2880e20e>"]},{"passage":"So, you’ve started your own business. Congrats! You must have a pretty overwhelming to-do list on your hands right about now, and managing your inventory is probably close to the top. Because most start-ups don’t have the cash to splash on an inventory-managing robot, we thought we’d share some advice on how to manage and organise your own inventory. Invest in Organisational Shelves and Products\nYes, cardboard boxes are great. And bags are handy too. But when it comes to your inventory, you need to take it up a notch to keep things organised and easy to find. If your small business or online store is blossoming from your spare room or garage, consider installing shelves and drawers for your stock. Then grab yourself a labeller to mark out certain spaces for certain products. Things will have their own designated place and you’ll be able to grab what you need without rustling through boxes and bags on the ground. Implement a Logical Layout\nSo the pink dog raincoats are flying out the door. But the green ones? Not so much. Take your product demand and turnover into account when organising a layout for your inventory. Put simply, you should keep stuff you always need (or frequently sell) at the front of your shelves or the top of your drawers, and stuff you don’t often need at the back or bottom. This will make your daily operations more efficient and make you 78%* less likely to split your pants while squatting down to grab stuff each day. *Totally fabricated statistic. National Storage cannot be held liable for any split pants. There really is an app for everything (there’s even one to train your bird to talk), and there’s no exception when it comes to getting your inventory on track. Try these helpful apps to keep your stock organised. $4.49 | Available on iPhone and iPad\nThis handy app is a lifesaver when it comes to tracking your inventory. When you buy new stock, you tell the app. As you receive, sell, ship and deliver items, you let the app know. This allows you to see everything in your inventory, their statuses, and your profits whenever you want. Inventory Now provides a simple stock overview that doesn’t leave you scratching your head and reaching for a calculator. $4.99 | Available on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch\nSave money on dud stock by keeping an eye on sales trends with this app. On Shelf tells you what items are in stock and what items need reordering, and the barcode feature allows you to enter sales in a flash. If you want to know which items sell and which items you shouldn’t bother with, On Shelf is your guy. Or girl. At this point in time, we don’t know what gender – if any – On Shelf identifies as. Use A Self-Storage Unit\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again – there really is nothing National Storage can’t do (except juggle; that is bloody tricky). Starting a business is also tricky, especially when it comes to finding a home for all your growing paperwork and inventory. If keeping boxes of files and stock in your garage isn’t really working for you, our business storage is the perfect solution. Some of our centres even offer a records management service for those of you who are feeling extra lazy. Just kidding! It really does take a lot of work off your hands, though. We’re considerate like that.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:47ba04ee-cdd3-4d7f-a5b8-8eab9952d433>"]},{"passage":"Because inventories are often a sizable investment, they require careful management. But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4062e551-14e8-4e85-8b14-fe7f97e87872>"]},{"passage":"Sound inventory management techniques are the foundation for strategic procurement, enabling you to:\nChoosing the right inventory management processes that suit your dental practice is not a simple task, and the more your business grows, the more difficult managing your inventory can be. That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:30866b38-eaa8-41fc-926a-ec0a418914f8>"]}]}

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.\n\nMost districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”\n\nFour-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.\n\nDriven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https:\/\/t.co\/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.\n\nYou get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). Short breaks gives time for kids to have a better education and avoids kids getting too board over the long break. Yeah, you wouldn’t get to have 3 week vacations, but who does? Some kids say that they get a break right when they need it and it’s refreshing to them and they’re ready to listen (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). It would be easier for them to pick up where they left\nAttending school on a year-round calendar or a traditional calendar is a huge debate in the school districts across the United States. It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents. Moreover, small high schools result in a wider array of student involvement. Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in. His narrative shows this support and how having instruction in Spanish and English allows him to have higher academics. In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed. Many of the schools in the United States do not give out E’s as\n(“Year-round education: Is summer vacation over... forever?”). This is significant because a great deal of children that had summer vacations before year round schooling have lost it because of year round schooling. Another piece of evidence would be that people are losing educate that they get in summer. 71 percent of adults not just including parents state that kids get educate from lessons during the months of summer by pursuing, working, athletics, or attending camp (“Year-round education: Is summer vacation\nShould There Be Year Round School? Studies show that learning in year round school increases less than 1%. There are many reason why there should be year round school, but here are some reasons why there shouldn’t be year round school. Continue reading if you want to know why there shouldn’t be year round school. One reason why there shouldn’t be year round school is because kids need a break from school. Second it messes with students and parents schedule. Plus it ruins summer. Most schools go 180 days a year with breaks in between then you get out and can enjoy your summer June through July. With year round schools you still go the traditional 180 days, of course with breaks in between, but you have to go to school in the summer so all you get off in the summer is June. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t go to a year round school, here are a few.\n\n- Increased attendance rates for teachers and students\n- Boosts morale among teachers and students\n- Additional time available for professional development and teacher planning\n- Savings on transportation and heating and cooling costs\n- Decreased need for substitute teachers; savings in substitute- teacher wages\n- More efficient use of classroom time\n- Fewer discipline problems\n- Difficulty finding child care on fifth day\n- Actual savings often less than anticipated savings\n- May have negative effects on at-risk students and those with special needs\n- May be difficult for younger students\n- Decreased wages for cafeteria workers and bus drivers, who lose one day of work per week\n- Effectiveness and appropriateness in large\/urban school districts\n- Impact on student achievement\nMoreover, the educational value of the time added on to each day, to account for the lost day of instruction, hasn’t been examined in depth. “Most of the research is anecdotal,” Ms. Christie said. A report from Indiana University’s CEEP says that there is no strong evidence that a four-day week has either a positive or negative effect on achievement. In Iowa, the state education department appears to concur with Ms. Christie’s assessment of the fiscal benefits of such a change. “The state has taken the stand that if a district is doing this just to save money, that’s not something they’re OK with. Historically, they haven’t approved those calendars,” said WACO Superintendent Darrell Smith. “And I’m OK with that. Education shouldn’t be about money.”\nLooking to Improve\nThough WACO wasn’t the first district in Iowa to make the request to the state for such a schedule change, it was the first to gain approval, largely because the district’s motivation has not been budget-based. “In fact, it could end up costing us money,” said Mr. Smith. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires that districts make “adequate yearly progress” on state academic tests. But, Mr. Smith said, “when we looked at our data, it was flat.”\nSo the district decided a four-day week might offer an opportunity to improve learning through additional assistance and educational enrichment opportunities for students and professional development for teachers. For 13 Fridays throughout the school year, beginning this week, students in all grades will have the opportunity to attend a half-day, when all teachers will be on hand for office hours, during which students can get remedial tutoring or opportunities for credit recovery. For students seeking an additional challenge, the district’s schools will also offer enrichment classes, such as music, engineering, or exploration science classes, on those Fridays or will allow for concurrent enrollment through the local community college, giving students the opportunity to acquire college credits. All other Fridays will be used for professional development, allowing teachers time to meet with fellow department members and collaboratively plan their lessons, or learn how to bring technology into their classrooms. “What we’re looking at is the opportunity to change the way our teachers teach,” said Mr. Smith. “We’re really interested in using technology as an instructional tool, and in putting it in the hands of kids. But we have to get our teachers ready first.”\nAs of last week, 95 percent of WACO's students had expressed interest in coming into school for the Friday programs. Mr. Smith said the district may use the time to bone up on computerized textbooks to develop more flexible curricula and digital assessments that will give teachers better feedback on what their students are learning and what knowledge they’re still lacking. “We don’t want to waste time teaching students what they already know. We want to teach what they don’t know,” he said. The WACO district plans to follow the schedule for at least three years to fully weigh its effectiveness based on student results from state and district assessments and teacher feedback. “[This plan] puts everybody on the same wavelength,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes everybody working toward the same thing to make something work.”\nVol. 33, Issue 04, Page 10\nGet more stories and free e-newsletters! - Aspen High School Principal\n- Aspen School District, Aspen, CO\n- Director of Schools (Superintendent)\n- Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, TN\n- Scale Your Impact.

After all, as one person noted, we are no longer an agrarian society. Nope, we’re a society where there are lots of two-income households. So if the child is home one day a week, who stays home to watch him or her? This is already a scenario that takes place when a child is sick, if there is a school snow day, or other emergencies. For many households, this becomes a juggling act worthy of the finest circus. It’s fun to assume that “somebody else” will fill in the gap. But who? The Y? Some social service agency? Or, perhaps in some ironic twist, the schools? Of course, the solution that some families have been forced to use is create a society of unsupervised latchkey kids. Hey, it works so well for a couple hours a day, doesn’t it? What’s another few hours? Seriously, such a plan has its benefits in terms of energy savings. My concern, besides the longer school day with less attentiveness and kids who depend on school lunches five days a week, is how the school-home balance beam is navigated.\n\nDUNCAN: We have a significantly shorter school year: 20, 25, 30 days versus India, versus China, other places. Our students are at a competitive disadvantage. BOLDUAN: The major argument for extending school time is summer learning loss. Researchers have found students can lose about a month's worth of achievement during the summer break. ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nFour-Day School Week\nAZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go\nAZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion!

Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher\/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher\/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water\/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|\n|School:||Grand Canyon University|\n|School Location:||United States -- Arizona|\n|Source:||DAI-A 79\/08(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|\n|Subjects:||Educational leadership, Educational administration|\n|Keywords:||District performance, Four-day school week, Stakeholder perception|\nCopyright in each Dissertation and Thesis is retained by the author.

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Most districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Four-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39e4263e-6eb5-4a7f-90a9-a501eac204e9>"]},{"passage":"Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https:\/\/t.co\/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:55f6c900-9897-45b9-9527-40ffb826db95>"]},{"passage":"You get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School).

His narrative shows this support and how having instruction in Spanish and English allows him to have higher academics. In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed. Many of the schools in the United States do not give out E’s as\n(“Year-round education: Is summer vacation over... forever?”).

Second it messes with students and parents schedule. Plus it ruins summer. Most schools go 180 days a year with breaks in between then you get out and can enjoy your summer June through July. With year round schools you still go the traditional 180 days, of course with breaks in between, but you have to go to school in the summer so all you get off in the summer is June. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t go to a year round school, here are a few.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:34a163ed-3301-42aa-9f41-2c376f3830ee>"]},{"passage":"- Increased attendance rates for teachers and students\n- Boosts morale among teachers and students\n- Additional time available for professional development and teacher planning\n- Savings on transportation and heating and cooling costs\n- Decreased need for substitute teachers; savings in substitute- teacher wages\n- More efficient use of classroom time\n- Fewer discipline problems\n- Difficulty finding child care on fifth day\n- Actual savings often less than anticipated savings\n- May have negative effects on at-risk students and those with special needs\n- May be difficult for younger students\n- Decreased wages for cafeteria workers and bus drivers, who lose one day of work per week\n- Effectiveness and appropriateness in large\/urban school districts\n- Impact on student achievement\nMoreover, the educational value of the time added on to each day, to account for the lost day of instruction, hasn’t been examined in depth. “Most of the research is anecdotal,” Ms. Christie said. A report from Indiana University’s CEEP says that there is no strong evidence that a four-day week has either a positive or negative effect on achievement. In Iowa, the state education department appears to concur with Ms. Christie’s assessment of the fiscal benefits of such a change. “The state has taken the stand that if a district is doing this just to save money, that’s not something they’re OK with. Historically, they haven’t approved those calendars,” said WACO Superintendent Darrell Smith. “And I’m OK with that. Education shouldn’t be about money.”\nLooking to Improve\nThough WACO wasn’t the first district in Iowa to make the request to the state for such a schedule change, it was the first to gain approval, largely because the district’s motivation has not been budget-based. “In fact, it could end up costing us money,” said Mr. Smith. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires that districts make “adequate yearly progress” on state academic tests. But, Mr. Smith said, “when we looked at our data, it was flat.”\nSo the district decided a four-day week might offer an opportunity to improve learning through additional assistance and educational enrichment opportunities for students and professional development for teachers. For 13 Fridays throughout the school year, beginning this week, students in all grades will have the opportunity to attend a half-day, when all teachers will be on hand for office hours, during which students can get remedial tutoring or opportunities for credit recovery. For students seeking an additional challenge, the district’s schools will also offer enrichment classes, such as music, engineering, or exploration science classes, on those Fridays or will allow for concurrent enrollment through the local community college, giving students the opportunity to acquire college credits. All other Fridays will be used for professional development, allowing teachers time to meet with fellow department members and collaboratively plan their lessons, or learn how to bring technology into their classrooms. “What we’re looking at is the opportunity to change the way our teachers teach,” said Mr. Smith. “We’re really interested in using technology as an instructional tool, and in putting it in the hands of kids. But we have to get our teachers ready first.”\nAs of last week, 95 percent of WACO's students had expressed interest in coming into school for the Friday programs. Mr. Smith said the district may use the time to bone up on computerized textbooks to develop more flexible curricula and digital assessments that will give teachers better feedback on what their students are learning and what knowledge they’re still lacking. “We don’t want to waste time teaching students what they already know. We want to teach what they don’t know,” he said. The WACO district plans to follow the schedule for at least three years to fully weigh its effectiveness based on student results from state and district assessments and teacher feedback. “[This plan] puts everybody on the same wavelength,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes everybody working toward the same thing to make something work.”\nVol. 33, Issue 04, Page 10\nGet more stories and free e-newsletters! - Aspen High School Principal\n- Aspen School District, Aspen, CO\n- Director of Schools (Superintendent)\n- Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, TN\n- Scale Your Impact.

After all, as one person noted, we are no longer an agrarian society. Nope, we’re a society where there are lots of two-income households. So if the child is home one day a week, who stays home to watch him or her? This is already a scenario that takes place when a child is sick, if there is a school snow day, or other emergencies. For many households, this becomes a juggling act worthy of the finest circus. It’s fun to assume that “somebody else” will fill in the gap. But who? The Y? Some social service agency? Or, perhaps in some ironic twist, the schools? Of course, the solution that some families have been forced to use is create a society of unsupervised latchkey kids. Hey, it works so well for a couple hours a day, doesn’t it? What’s another few hours? Seriously, such a plan has its benefits in terms of energy savings. My concern, besides the longer school day with less attentiveness and kids who depend on school lunches five days a week, is how the school-home balance beam is navigated.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3b637971-6bae-4ed3-818b-612618a7d857>"]},{"passage":"DUNCAN: We have a significantly shorter school year: 20, 25, 30 days versus India, versus China, other places. Our students are at a competitive disadvantage. BOLDUAN: The major argument for extending school time is summer learning loss. Researchers have found students can lose about a month's worth of achievement during the summer break. ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nFour-Day School Week\nAZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go\nAZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion!

Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher\/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher\/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water\/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|\n|School:||Grand Canyon University|\n|School Location:||United States -- Arizona|\n|Source:||DAI-A 79\/08(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|\n|Subjects:||Educational leadership, Educational administration|\n|Keywords:||District performance, Four-day school week, Stakeholder perception|\nCopyright in each Dissertation and Thesis is retained by the author.

Keeping track of all of them can be a real pain, especially if you have to log in and out of each one every time you want to use it. Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem: API integrations. API integrations allow you to connect two or more applications so that they can share data and information with each other. This means that you can access all of your applications from one central location, and you don't have to remember multiple login credentials. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up API integrations:\nMake sure that the applications you're connecting support API integration. Not all applications do, so it's important to check before you get started. You can usually tell if this is the case if they have an \"API\" link at the bottom of their homepage. Determine what kind of data you want to share between the applications. Some integrations only allow for basic data sharing, while others allow for more complex interaction. Determine how the applications will share data. Will data be automatically synced between the applications, or will you need to manually transfer data? Set up a secure connection between the applications. This is important to prevent unauthorized access to your data. Once you've considered these factors, you're ready to start setting up API integrations. There are a few different ways to do this, so we'll outline a few of the most popular methods. One of the most popular methods for setting up API integrations is using a service like Zapier or IFTTT. These services allow you to connect a wide variety of applications and services, and they make it easy to automate tasks between them. For example, you could use Zapier to automatically add new contacts from your CRM to your email marketing list. Another popular method for setting up API integrations is through custom development. This is typically more complex than using a service like Zapier or IFTTT, but it gives you more control over the integration. If you're not a developer, you can hire someone to develop the integration for you. Once you've set up your API integration, it's important to test it to make sure everything is working as expected. You don't want to wait until you need to use the integration to find out that there are problems. API integrations can simplify your life by allowing you to connect all of your favorite applications and services in one place. By taking the time to set up an integration, you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration in the long run.\n\nThis is a third-party integration built by Welcome to the Jungle.

Not only does this enable you to take information out of your app but also ensures you can control actions inside the app based on your preferences. To get started, you will need a Zapier account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up here: https:\/\/zapier.com\/sign-up\/\nWhen you've secured your account let us know and we will turn it on for you in the Console. Setting Up the Zaps\nMost of it is controlled on Zapier's side which you can find on your app dashboard: https:\/\/zapier.com\/app\/dashboard\nTo get up and running, you'll need to connect your Zapier account with Disciple. To do this simply let your Customer Success Manager know that you're intending to use the Zapier integration and they'll switch it on for you. Once confirmed, navigate to the Integrations tab on the Console, generate an API Key, and add it to Zapier. Navigate to \"My Apps\" In Zapier, then select an \"add a connection\". From here search for Disciple and you will see the following screen. Take the API key you retrieved from the console and away you go, it really is that easy.

If you are just reading or getting data, go right on ahead, you won't mess anything up. Project Insight uses an API token to identify an authenticated user on the server. Find the API URL and token in the Administration section as follows:\nCreate a REST API Token\nYou'll need an API token to validate any API requests. This is either done in your application's interface or in the code by query string or within the request header. When you click the button, a layer will ask you create a token based on a user's permissions. If using this token for READ access for reports, you can identify a \"User Context\" to mimic the permissions PI should follow when we \"get\" report data. If using this token for an application, we recommend creating a specific API user instead of just using an existing user account. Therefore, actions done using the API are clearly identifiable. \"Where do I put this token?\" you ask. If you are using a reporting tool to get PI data, they will usually provide an interface where you can input your API URL and token (see Get your Project Data Directly to Excel as an example).

Getting out with your dog and enjoying the warm weather is the ultimate reward after being trapped inside all winter with a bored dog. From lake visits and dog friendly patios to hiking the Metroparks, if you have an active dog, you (and your dog) have no excuse to be bored during the summer months.\nIn addition to all of the outdoor activities you can do with your dog, local rescue groups host a number of fun dog friendly events throughout the summer. Here are the Top 5 Dog Friendly Events this summer you don’t want to miss:\nBring your dog along to watch you sip on some wine and tour the vineyards of Grand River Cellars in Madison. Held on June 13, Woof, Wag and Wine includes a tour of the winery, live music and auctions. Admission is $20 a person (which includes a Muddy Paws wine sampling) and proceeds go to the Lake Humane Society.\nAlthough the Indians aren’t doing their Puppypalooza event this year, you still have some opportunities to take your dog to a baseball game. Both the Lake Erie Captains and the Akron Rubber Ducks hold dog friendly nights. The Lake Erie Captains will hold their Bark at the Park on July 28, August 11 and August 23, and the Akron Rubber Ducks’ dog friendly games will be June 10 and August 19. A portion of the proceeds from each game will benefit local rescue groups.\nThe largest dog friendly event in Ohio, Canine Fun Days, is held every August at the Metroparks Polo Fields in Moreland Hills.

Bring your dog to enjoy a swim at Ledge Pool as well as a mini dog fair including vendors and exhibitors. Also, dogs are allowed on rowboats at Hinckley Reservation, so if your dog doesn’t enjoy swimming you can rent a rowboat and take him for a boat ride instead.\nAnn McDonald is the writer behind the website Dogs in the CLE, the source for what to do with your dog in Cleveland.

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.\n\nDo you hate leaving your precious pooch behind when you go out for lunch? There are several places in town that let you bring Fido, as long as he’s leashed and friendly. Here are some of the best pet-friendly restaurants near Springs Apartments. Called the \"best place to bring your puppy for a sweet treat,\" Snookies is a locally owned sweet shop and an area tradition. Take time for a visit to this quaint shop brimming with old-fashioned charm and get a cone for both you and your furry friend. Snookies regularly shares photos of happy dogs enjoying their puppy cones on its Facebook page. This deli prides itself on serving meals made from fresh, natural ingredients. They also take care to offer sandwiches and other menu items that are vegetarian and gluten-free. Your dog can join you at the outside dining area while you enjoy a Caprese Panini with fresh basil and tomato or the New Orleans Muffaletta. This nationwide sandwich shop lets your four-legged friend join you at its outside tables. There is also free Wi-Fi available, so you can munch away, check your Facebook feed and scratch your dog's ears all at the same time. Just don't fall for those sad, brown eyes begging you to share your broccoli and cheddar soup in a bread bowl. For great Mexican grub with dog-friendly outside dining, Chipotle at the Valley Mall should be your destination. Let Fido settle in for a nap under the table on the patio while you dig into one of Chipotle's fantastic burritos stuffed full of fresh ingredients. So, when lunchtime rolls around, you don't have to close the door on your dog's sad face. Grab the leash and take her with you to one of these fun places that loves dogs almost as much as you do.\n\nPet-Centric Establishments Gaining Popularity Around The World\nGood news for foodies with pets, more and more animal-friendly establishments are opening across the U.S. From kitty teahouses to dog park bars, it seems drinking and dining with pets is the new trend for 2014. KitTea, San Francisco\nA new feline-concept teahouse is being planned for San Francisco by business partners Courtney Hatt and David Barginsky. The cat coffeeshop is still in the planning stages but hopes to create an atmosphere for cat lovers to come and enjoy an afternoon tea while in the company of kitties. In order to keep up with health code regulations, there will likely be separate spaces for food sales and kitty lounging. However, guests will be allowed, and encouraged, to take their food purchases into the cat zone. Hatt and Barginsky hope to even partner with local pet stores or rescue organizations to allow guests to take home animals with whom they felt they had a special connection. The Boneyard in Houston is a bar and dog park all in one. Unlike KitTea, where the animals will live in-house, Boneyard has a strict bring-your-own-dog policy. Patrons are encouraged to bring their furry friends to play in the more than 7,000 square feet of park space. Meanwhile, dog owners can enjoy a drink from the bar’s extensive beer and wine list. Pets Deli, Berlin\nThe Pets Deli in Berlin is a one-of-a-kind food market serving up gourmet pet food to animals with discerning taste. The menu at Pet Deli is split into Meat, Vegetables and Carbs, offering animal friends a complete and balanced nutritional meal. The good people at Pets Deli even offer desserts for those pets on their “cheat day.” All offerings are approved by an on-staff animal nutritionist and can be served in a metal bowl to stay or ordered to-go in a plastic box.\n\nEating out with your pup can be a fun experience, but not all restaurants are dog friendly. Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.\n\nDrinking with friends is great, but drinking with your dog is even better. If you’ve worried about bringing your pups with you when claiming your daily PintHub beer, worry no more. In honor of National Dog Day, we’ve compiled a list of dog-friendly PintHub venues (we narrowed it down since there were so many!) so that you can celebrate the right way today. Take a look at the best local venues on PintHub to explore this weekend, whether you’re in Austin, Dallas or the Fort Worth area—and if you want even more options, check out Dog Friendly Alliance’s website for a curated list of all the places you can bring your pups. Cheers! First on the list, is Austin Beerworks. Sitting on the north side of Austin, this local brewery comes equipped with a great outdoor area. Your pups will be very happy here—and so will you. If you haven’t tried their Peacemaker, an “anytime ale”, stay refreshed with that new pick. Just three minutes away from Austin Beerworks, you’ll find local gem, Adelbert’s Brewery. As soon as you load their Instagram page (@adelbertsbeer), you’ll find yourself looking at a great snap shot of a puppers on their patio. Your fur-child will definitely make new friends while you try a new beer. photo via @adelbertsbeer\nIf you’re really into trying something new, then this is the place for you. You can currently get a glass of their specially brewed creation, Discovery, a perfect name for the brew to catapult you into a new world of mead. Though dogs can’t go inside the taproom due to the brewing process, they are more than welcome out on the patio. With five options of beer to choose from on our PintHub app, Hi Sign is a great place to bring your pups. You can happily scroll through their Instagram to find the best doggos gracing your screen—and with hammocks and a great space, it’s no wonder dog owners love to bring their dogs there. This is also the perfect opportunity for you to snap a picture of your own pet and claim bragging rights on your own social media. photo via @hisignbrewing\nThe outdoor patio greets humans and pets alike. If you’re more into enjoying some food with your beer, Via 313 Pizza will serve as a great choice for you. Not only can pups help you with the pizza, but they can hang out with you outside—preferably once the sun starts to set in this heated summer. This venue is also going to have the most options for you to try, so good luck picking one! photo via @via313\nDon’t worry, DFW friends, we’ve got some places for you, too. Designed with a huge open floor plan, you can easily enjoy a brew in this dog-friendly taproom. There’s plenty of shade, so an afternoon trip won’t be terrible. Celebrate the day with a Sip-N-Go Pils or the Soul Pleasure stout. If you’re craving a view of downtown Ft. Worth, then this is the taproom for you. A view, your pups and a cold, lovingly-crafted beer—do you need anything else? Bring your pup out and enjoy the appropriate brew, Sweet Fang. photo via @pantherislandbrewing\nOne can never do wrong with a good can design. Admire the can you’re drinking from while you and your pups sit in an eclectic taproom in Dallas. An appropriate beer for the occasion? Off the Leash, a red ale that’s a solid six percent ABV. Since the venue does serve food, pets must be strictly confined to the patio. That doesn’t make them any less dog-friendly, though. Set up shop and relax while you celebrate the best day ever with your best friend. Just north of Dallas, in Farmer’s Branch, Texas, lies 3 Nations Brewing, a community taproom that loves having your dog around. Another great thing about them? PintHub and 3 Nations Brewing have over 10 beers for you to try at their location. Overwhelming? Try their American Wit or the Stone Wizard Double IPA. photo via @3nationsbrewing\nWhichever venue you choose, celebrate National Dog Day with your furry best friend with your “on the house” beer. Open up your PintHub app and start drinking!\n\nDogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?\n\nWelcome to this week’s installment of Ask the Critics. If you have a question you’d like answered in a future column, email us or leave the query in the comments. Today, we deal with a question that always comes up with the advent of warm weather:\nWhich restaurants will allow me to bring my dog? Technically, dogs aren’t allowed at restaurants, but some places will let you park Fluffy at your table in an outdoor seating section. Eateries with an enclosure around their sidewalk seating are likely to ask you to hitch your dog outside the railing, and then will seat you right next to it. Plus, some bars welcome dogs inside. At Pastis, your dog is welcome to sit outside the sidewalk barricade, and staff will bring a bowl of water if you ask. Similarly, Toby’s Public House, the excellent wood-oven pizza spot in Greenwood Heights, has a deck where your dog can sit right next to you, though outside the railing. The staff are very friendly about it, and will also bring water for the dog. Dog-friendly outdoor seating areas without enclosures are harder to find because, technically, they’re against code. Tabla is more hospitable than most, allowing pooches to sit with their owners in the outdoor cafe that overlooks Madison Square Park. And Pao, the comfortable Portuguese spot in the West Village, will let canines sit with you at the sidewalk tables.

You’ve worked hard all week and you deserve a reward. You decide to treat yourself to dinner with friends at a nice restaurant, the kind you typically don’t go to on a weeknight. Once seated and handed a menu, there’s nothing left to do but enjoy the company of your companions, order a nice meal you don’t have to cook yourself, and let the stress melt away. Even the atmosphere helps to set the mood. Or it would, except…what is that, a dog? Some obnoxious woman, mere seats away, has snuck a buggy-eyed Chihuahua-looking thing into the restaurant, using a large purse as concealment. You watch as she portions some of her own food into small bites, depositing them into the snapping mouth that protrudes from the handbag. But all that mouth does is eat. It doesn’t bark, whine, or chew on your shoes. In fact, you might not have even known it was there were it not for your careful scanning to see if any noisy children were present. And, since the dog doesn’t seem to bother you, you can enjoy your evening like you’d planned all along. So, what would be the harm in allowing dogs in restaurants? There are some who are certain dogs are naturally incapable of this (Anderson). A large establishment with no dog restrictions might have, say, ten dogs inside, seated with their owners. Those against allowing them believe these dogs would inevitably begin to bark at each other, even engage in vicious brawls mid-salad course. Not to mention, there’s the possibility of dogs choosing to relieve themselves inside the restaurant, or getting their hair in customers’ food. And what about people who are afraid of dogs, or miserably allergic to their fur? Don’t they have a right to enjoy their meal just like anyone else? To answer all these questions, it is important to consider what paying restaurant customers want. Most notably, they would prefer to eat somewhere that is clean. This includes wiped down tables, tidily swept floors, and a pleasant food smell untainted by garbage odors or overpowering scents. In addition, they enjoy environments with a reasonable murmur of chatter, not too loud as to deafen other patrons, but not too soft as to require everyone whisper self-consciously. Of course, the food is of utmost importance, so it must be sanitary and appealing. All these components are part of what makes a good restaurant good, and a lack of one or more will cause some paying customers to turn away, choosing to take their business elsewhere. Even English Bulldogs can have excellent table manners. It is certainly true some people are allergic to dogs. It is also true some people are allergic to perfumes, pollen, and some commonly encountered foods. Allowing dogs in restaurants would not significantly impact these unfortunate few because some dogs are already allowed to go anywhere their owner can go. These dogs serve those with disabilities, such as guiding the blind and alerting the deaf. They occur where fearful and sniffly people go, and so far have coexisted without any big scenes. Thus, the presence of other, similarly well-behaved dogs would not increase their discomfort, as they have already made any necessary personal adjustments for the inevitable service dog. Regardless of these efforts, some irresponsible dog owners have chosen the selfish route, purchasing a vest and identification card for their pet and claiming it is a service dog (Shah). Without the years of work and training that go into the real deal, these imposters have created a negative reputation for actual service dogs and well-trained pets alike. It has gotten to the point where either the out-of-control “service” dog is allowed because the restaurant owner cannot tell it is disguised, or the real service dog is denied because they cannot tell it is legitimate. To top it off, there are other careless owners who will act like celebrities, smuggling poorly trained dogs in their purses and ignoring its aggressive displays. These obnoxious diners ruin the meal for everyone else, and hinder the possibility for respectful dogs to accompany their owners out to eat. But what if they were all good?\n\nSome of the guys who show up for happy hour at the Bark Bar don't bother with formalities when they spot a female. They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!\" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. \"Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.\"","passages":[{"passage":"Dog Friendly Restaurant Chains\nWith the increasing number of dog-friendly restaurant chains, you can enjoy a great meal with your furry family member.

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6acc9498-93c7-4e61-9aac-d0c7b68ab4f0>"]},{"passage":"Do you hate leaving your precious pooch behind when you go out for lunch?

KitTea, San Francisco\nA new feline-concept teahouse is being planned for San Francisco by business partners Courtney Hatt and David Barginsky. The cat coffeeshop is still in the planning stages but hopes to create an atmosphere for cat lovers to come and enjoy an afternoon tea while in the company of kitties. In order to keep up with health code regulations, there will likely be separate spaces for food sales and kitty lounging. However, guests will be allowed, and encouraged, to take their food purchases into the cat zone. Hatt and Barginsky hope to even partner with local pet stores or rescue organizations to allow guests to take home animals with whom they felt they had a special connection. The Boneyard in Houston is a bar and dog park all in one. Unlike KitTea, where the animals will live in-house, Boneyard has a strict bring-your-own-dog policy. Patrons are encouraged to bring their furry friends to play in the more than 7,000 square feet of park space. Meanwhile, dog owners can enjoy a drink from the bar’s extensive beer and wine list. Pets Deli, Berlin\nThe Pets Deli in Berlin is a one-of-a-kind food market serving up gourmet pet food to animals with discerning taste. The menu at Pet Deli is split into Meat, Vegetables and Carbs, offering animal friends a complete and balanced nutritional meal.

Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6acc9498-93c7-4e61-9aac-d0c7b68ab4f0>"]},{"passage":"Drinking with friends is great, but drinking with your dog is even better. If you’ve worried about bringing your pups with you when claiming your daily PintHub beer, worry no more. In honor of National Dog Day, we’ve compiled a list of dog-friendly PintHub venues (we narrowed it down since there were so many!) so that you can celebrate the right way today. Take a look at the best local venues on PintHub to explore this weekend, whether you’re in Austin, Dallas or the Fort Worth area—and if you want even more options, check out Dog Friendly Alliance’s website for a curated list of all the places you can bring your pups. Cheers! First on the list, is Austin Beerworks. Sitting on the north side of Austin, this local brewery comes equipped with a great outdoor area. Your pups will be very happy here—and so will you. If you haven’t tried their Peacemaker, an “anytime ale”, stay refreshed with that new pick. Just three minutes away from Austin Beerworks, you’ll find local gem, Adelbert’s Brewery. As soon as you load their Instagram page (@adelbertsbeer), you’ll find yourself looking at a great snap shot of a puppers on their patio. Your fur-child will definitely make new friends while you try a new beer. photo via @adelbertsbeer\nIf you’re really into trying something new, then this is the place for you. You can currently get a glass of their specially brewed creation, Discovery, a perfect name for the brew to catapult you into a new world of mead. Though dogs can’t go inside the taproom due to the brewing process, they are more than welcome out on the patio. With five options of beer to choose from on our PintHub app, Hi Sign is a great place to bring your pups. You can happily scroll through their Instagram to find the best doggos gracing your screen—and with hammocks and a great space, it’s no wonder dog owners love to bring their dogs there. This is also the perfect opportunity for you to snap a picture of your own pet and claim bragging rights on your own social media. photo via @hisignbrewing\nThe outdoor patio greets humans and pets alike. If you’re more into enjoying some food with your beer, Via 313 Pizza will serve as a great choice for you. Not only can pups help you with the pizza, but they can hang out with you outside—preferably once the sun starts to set in this heated summer. This venue is also going to have the most options for you to try, so good luck picking one! photo via @via313\nDon’t worry, DFW friends, we’ve got some places for you, too. Designed with a huge open floor plan, you can easily enjoy a brew in this dog-friendly taproom. There’s plenty of shade, so an afternoon trip won’t be terrible. Celebrate the day with a Sip-N-Go Pils or the Soul Pleasure stout. If you’re craving a view of downtown Ft. Worth, then this is the taproom for you. A view, your pups and a cold, lovingly-crafted beer—do you need anything else? Bring your pup out and enjoy the appropriate brew, Sweet Fang. photo via @pantherislandbrewing\nOne can never do wrong with a good can design. Admire the can you’re drinking from while you and your pups sit in an eclectic taproom in Dallas. An appropriate beer for the occasion? Off the Leash, a red ale that’s a solid six percent ABV. Since the venue does serve food, pets must be strictly confined to the patio. That doesn’t make them any less dog-friendly, though. Set up shop and relax while you celebrate the best day ever with your best friend. Just north of Dallas, in Farmer’s Branch, Texas, lies 3 Nations Brewing, a community taproom that loves having your dog around. Another great thing about them? PintHub and 3 Nations Brewing have over 10 beers for you to try at their location. Overwhelming? Try their American Wit or the Stone Wizard Double IPA. photo via @3nationsbrewing\nWhichever venue you choose, celebrate National Dog Day with your furry best friend with your “on the house” beer.

A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog.

Those against allowing them believe these dogs would inevitably begin to bark at each other, even engage in vicious brawls mid-salad course. Not to mention, there’s the possibility of dogs choosing to relieve themselves inside the restaurant, or getting their hair in customers’ food. And what about people who are afraid of dogs, or miserably allergic to their fur? Don’t they have a right to enjoy their meal just like anyone else? To answer all these questions, it is important to consider what paying restaurant customers want. Most notably, they would prefer to eat somewhere that is clean. This includes wiped down tables, tidily swept floors, and a pleasant food smell untainted by garbage odors or overpowering scents. In addition, they enjoy environments with a reasonable murmur of chatter, not too loud as to deafen other patrons, but not too soft as to require everyone whisper self-consciously. Of course, the food is of utmost importance, so it must be sanitary and appealing. All these components are part of what makes a good restaurant good, and a lack of one or more will cause some paying customers to turn away, choosing to take their business elsewhere. Even English Bulldogs can have excellent table manners. It is certainly true some people are allergic to dogs. It is also true some people are allergic to perfumes, pollen, and some commonly encountered foods. Allowing dogs in restaurants would not significantly impact these unfortunate few because some dogs are already allowed to go anywhere their owner can go. These dogs serve those with disabilities, such as guiding the blind and alerting the deaf. They occur where fearful and sniffly people go, and so far have coexisted without any big scenes. Thus, the presence of other, similarly well-behaved dogs would not increase their discomfort, as they have already made any necessary personal adjustments for the inevitable service dog. Regardless of these efforts, some irresponsible dog owners have chosen the selfish route, purchasing a vest and identification card for their pet and claiming it is a service dog (Shah). Without the years of work and training that go into the real deal, these imposters have created a negative reputation for actual service dogs and well-trained pets alike. It has gotten to the point where either the out-of-control “service” dog is allowed because the restaurant owner cannot tell it is disguised, or the real service dog is denied because they cannot tell it is legitimate. To top it off, there are other careless owners who will act like celebrities, smuggling poorly trained dogs in their purses and ignoring its aggressive displays. These obnoxious diners ruin the meal for everyone else, and hinder the possibility for respectful dogs to accompany their owners out to eat. But what if they were all good?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:41a052fb-dfbb-4653-a094-c46daa81092c>"]},{"passage":"Some of the guys who show up for happy hour at the Bark Bar don't bother with formalities when they spot a female. They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!\" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. \"Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.\"","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e1efcf1c-ec5b-4fa3-b793-dbf8f9edc491>"]}]}

Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!\nBut the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.\nAnd if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).\nSo, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!\n1. Pack LAYERS.\nThere is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n2. Anticipate darkness.\nThis may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.\n3. Pack sustainable food.\nWhen I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup\/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt\/pepper\/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs\/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!\n4. Embrace the gross\nDepending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!\n5. Anticipate problems\nKnock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:\n- Lots of water\n- Toilet paper\n- A good knife\n- A lighter or box of matches\n- First aid kit\n- A map and compass\n- Storm-proof outdoor gear\n- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)\n6. Bring some of the good stuff\nCamping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.\nAlways make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.\nDo you have any good camping tips to share?

Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV\/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.\n\nWhen you’re roughing it, you don’t think of pampering yourself, yet there is no reason to completely neglect hygiene. Paying attention to your skin, hair, and teeth will certainly be appreciated by those around you on a particular backpacking or camping expedition. Whether you’re camping, hiking, fishing, or backpacking, the normal rules of hygiene still apply. Here’s how to keep practicing great hygiene while you’re out and about in among the outdoors. Flickr Creative Common License: Archigeek\nDry socks are very valuable when venturing throughout the outdoors. A dry, clean pair of socks is so easy to find normally but not when you’re miles from your sock drawer. Throw a few more pairs of socks in your sack before heading out. Regardless of your activity or destination, you’ll be moving a lot and on your feet a majority of the time. Wet, dirty socks attract bacteria, which leads to a host of foot issues that can last well beyond the excursion. You can hang a pair on the outside of your pack as to quicken the drying process in emergency situations. Take along a small bottle of hand sanitizer, using it frequently after touching trees, plants, and going in lakes. You will be using your hands to cook food, clean equipment, and eat. Therefore, you’ll lessen the likelihood of ingesting and coming in contact with bacteria if you make it a habit to clean your hands with the sanitizer. It’s an easy way to avoid sickness, which would be unfortunate, especially while on the trip. You won’t be able to take a shower but that doesn’t mean you won’t be able to keep yourself clean. Take along a package of baby wipes to use to clean your entire body. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to find how refreshed and cleaner you’ll feel after wiping yourself down. Nothing can replace a nice, hot shower but baby wipes do well to remove dirt and bacteria from your body parts. You can achieve the same effect with a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls but it’s easier to use the wipes. You don’t want to neglect your mouth and teeth because you’re away from your bathroom sink. Regardless of your location, it’s still important to brush, floss, and gargle with mouthwash. Place the dental essentials in your backpack. Be mindful of when spitting out your mouthwash and toothpaste. You don’t want it running into a natural body of water. Also, the smell can attract wild animals so dispose of your mouthfuls a distance away from the camp. Read on the topic further if you decide to choose dental powder rather than paste. Those with long hair may want to braid or keep it up or back with a hair tie. Those who are going to be out in the wilderness for a while may want to cover oily hair with a headband. Also, running baby powder through the hair will help with soaking up some of the excess oil. You could bring a travel-size bottle of shampoo and quickly wash your hair out with the help of a bottle of water. It’s necessary to know of the things you can go without in addition to minding the things you’ll need. For example, you don’t need to wear deodorant; in fact, it’s suggested to leave it at home because the scent will help attract bugs and wild animals. The same goes for perfumes and cologne. There is no need for it in the wilderness and it can work against you. Of course, you don’t want to smell dirty; that’s why you’ll keep your armpits clean with baby wipes and a bit of powder. You’ll get used to the ‘natural’ smell of your skin after a day or two. The weight of your backpack and the number of needed items is always a concern to those who are hiking and camping. You’ll want to balance packing too many clothes with knowing when to change and clean what you do bring. Replace sweaty shirts and pants each night with fresh clothing. It’s best to change before going to sleep for the night. Sleeping in dirty clothes makes your sleeping bag smell and it also introduces the opportunity for rashes and skin problems. Of course, you’ll want to consider the type of material. Some materials wick away sweat while feeling light on the skin. Cotton will make a sweaty shirt stick to your skin and does not feel comfortable in the rain.\n\nHow to maintain personal hygiene on a trek! Vanity goes out of the window when you are in the wilderness. One is in the mountains to survive in the simplest forms like the mountain men. Because that’s how Yeti is supposed to be. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore your personal hygiene too. Spending days in the wilderness on long treks like Roopkund Trek, Pin Parvati Pass with no bath can make you stink like a raccoon and make you feel all icky and lousy. Maintaining personal hygiene on the trek is as important as keeping yourself hydrated on the trek. Not only it keeps the diseases at bay but also helps you feel fresh and vigorous for a longer time. These things can feel a bit of a struggle with no proper sanitation facilities available on the trek as we are used to back in the comfort of our homes. Here is how you can carry out your personal hygiene manners on the trek without any fuss:\n1. Making your business\nDo not defecate where you eat. Even the dogs follow this simple rule. Then why not we humans. Keep these things in mind next to you attend nature's call in the woods. - Do not make a toilet tent or dig a hole near your camp. The defecation area should be at least 50 meters away from your tent and the water source. - Dig a 6-inch deep hole for your business. A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2. Changing clothes on the trek\nHow often should you change clothes on trek? If it is a long trek, it is wise option to rotate your clothes. Segregate your hiking clothes and camping clothes. After you reach the camping site, change into clean and dry clothing. Your sweaty clothes from hiking can end up giving you body rashes and bad odor. Sleeping with soiled clothes on in your sleeping bag can really make you uncomfortable. Plus, your sleeping will bag will start to stink too. Next day, when you resume trekking, you can change back into your trekking clothes. Avoid changing into a different pair of clothes in sub-zero temperatures on the treks like Bali Pass and Goecha La unless absolutely necessary. 3. How to take a dry bath\n“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess\nYou are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:\n- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air. It’s better you leave it at home. - Change your clothes in the daytime when the temperature is comparatively warm. Working up a sweat on the trek is always wow. But it will just be a matter of few days when the flies start meandering around you if ignore your personal hygiene. Not a pretty picture, right? Following these hygiene tips can save you from the humiliation.\n\nWhy Feminine Hygiene Is So Important And What To Do About It\nLast updated on : August 13 2020\nSometimes We Are Too Busy For Personal Hygiene\nWomen have a lot of responsibilities in the household. Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully\nShaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.\n\nWhy Should You Maintain Body Hygiene? It is commendable that people be sensitized on the importance of hygiene in relation to their own health. People who practice proper hygiene rarely have mental and bodily illnesses. It is no news that there are individuals who will never adopt hygiene practices as they find them to be real tasks while others are naturally hygienic. Just as anyone eats regularly and visits the toilets at intervals so should be done with brushing teeth and cleaning hands. The place where you keep your clothes and dresses should always be clean to ensure you wear clean clothes to your clean body. When you are sure to be clean you are sure to feel great about who you are. When you appreciate yourself, it gets important for your mental health. Discriminations comes for most people in life who have a record of poor hygiene. It gets frustrating to have some signs of an unhygienic body like odour. Most people who have poor hygiene issues and fail to bathe usually happen to be undergoing depression and frustration. It is important therefore such people get assessed properly to find out why their hygiene levels are wanting. Where you are unsure of what is causing your improper hygiene practices, you can always see an expert. There are things you should do to ensure you are always hygienic. Bathing for all persons is paramount. Bathing includes shampooing your hair and taking a bath at regular durations. That does not mean you clean yourself as regularly as you take your meals. You are required to at least take shower daily. Each person’s skin always sheds some skin. If you shower regularly, you help your skin shed off some unnecessary skin. When you fail to shower well and regularly, the skin shed will build up in your body which could mean illnesses. To maintain proper hygiene you must also learn to trim your nails. You should trim and shape the finger and toenails. This maintenance helps prevent hangnails and infected nail beds. Ensure also that your foot is well cleaned. Clean and dry feet are less likely to contract athlete’s foot. One more hygiene practice to carry regularly is flossing and teeth brushing. After you take your meal, any meal, you should ensure to brush or floss. You should fight any bacterial infection from your mouth by keeping it clean as you brush and floss. If you need to keep your teeth strong and have healthy gums make flossing a habit for you. Some bacteria are known for causing heart conditions comes from the lack of flossing and teeth brushing. For good mental and physical hygiene, it is recommended you maintain personal hygiene. Citation: my sources\n\nPerfect grooming exercise:\nBefore being rushed towards the feel of the topic, let me first introduce you to what the given title speaks. Grooming exercises, actually refer a criteria of being continually linked with updating. No matter how you’re there’s always a requirement of upgrading conditions. This upgrading could be in a form of general bath, washing face, clipping nails and etc. Obviously! No matter whichever the gender you’re belonging to, there’s always a necessity for bringing yourself up to date. Correspondingly as how every other component of life contains a criteria of enhancing, humanity requires the given constant criteria. Hence, a perfect grooming exercises has certain things that you should perform. A perfect grooming exercise includes:\nIn addition to what I’ve mentioned above, let’s focus to what we’re going to be discussing further. Men might seem tough to you externally but internally, they seem to be a lot sensitive. So yes, they also do need some sort of grooming exercises for a better health and future. - Good Personal Hygiene:\nWhen it’s about men’s health, personal hygiene becomes as a necessity for sure. Gabriela Cora, MD who’s basically a psychiatrist and holding a huge reputation as a consultant in Miami states that too many guys don’t focus up to the basic hygiene rules. She further speaks a good hygiene seems to be critical, not only to overall men’s health but also to being successful in life. - Wash Your Face Twice a Day:\nIt’s not just termed as a persona’s hygiene rule but also a critical aspect of men’s health. So literate yourselves by being conscious about not utilizing soaps or body gels. Using soap or water could strip your skin off essential moisture and upset its natural pH balance. Instead, a facial cleanser is designed to normalize your pH and restore the moisture-balance. - Changing Underwear:\nOften after a busy routine-work, you might feel as if why you’re even wearing the undergarments. Neglecting their essence could create damages to your persona. Thus, be in them when necessary and keep changing them whenever it’s needed. Though, it’d be quite an outstanding criteria if you’d keep changing them with the intervals of a day. Take shower once in a day-time and before going to bed, if necessary. It’d be a necessity for you to take the shower at least twice a day, if you’ve worked more than 12 hours in that day. Showering is a requirement right after each exercise you do or raise your heartbeat and perspire. - Clipping Nails:\nHey! Don’t you forget to trim your cuticles, those flaps of skin at the sides of your nails! When it’s about grooming, neat and well-groomed nails are on the top of the list. If they’re long enough to collect the dirt then they’re officially prepared to be clipped off. The given exercises, after all my rationale research are the most prominent grooming-exercises which could lead your conditions towards the whole new level of awesomeness. Henceforth, exercise them in your normal life to radiate the enhancement on every passing day.\n\nIn 2007, the National Public Radio reported that not all Americans value cleanliness. Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.\n\nWestward expansion \/ manifest destiny dbq essential question: did the benefits of manifest destiny and westward expansion outweigh the negative consequences it is difficult to find a camping ground without carcasses - jg bruff, 1849. 9 reasons camping is beneficial to your health summer is the time for family vacations, fishing our campgrounds are placed in a natural setting, giving you the benefits of camping without the discomforts contact us to ask about our accommodations and amenities.

The important thing to do is keep the pH (defense mechanism against infections) of the vagina balanced. This is essential to avoid any kind of infection. It is therefore absolutely necessary to have certain care routines that do not alter the vaginal pH, thus preventing the onset of infections or any other type of discomfort. 4 Tips for correct feminine intimate hygiene. In addition to the usual hygiene methods and products, it is essential that you incorporate other care suggestions, which are essential to take care of your intimate hygiene. Pay attention to the following recommendations. Let's start! 1. Avoid using perfumed soaps:\nPerfumed soaps contain substances that, when in contact with the intimate area, could notably affect the vaginal flora. In the case of astringent soaps, these could represent greater damage because they contain a large amount of caustic soda, which immediately kills the vaginal flora. Instead, you can use glycerin soaps or specific soaps for washing the vulva. The important thing is that the type of soap used can maintain the pH of the vagina. 2. Avoid douching (unless prescribed by a doctor). Many women resort to douching to ensure \"effective cleansing\" of the intimate area, without realizing that this is a terrible idea. Most doctors do not recommend this type of douching. Why? Douching disrupts the balance of the vaginal flora. Causing a growth of irritations and infections. 3. Use cotton underwear\nPaying attention to the type of underwear you use is also important for good feminine hygiene. Try to change them daily and use preferably cotton underwear. Why cotton underwear? This type of fabric allows greater air circulation, thus preventing the generation of excessive heat and the rapid reproduction of bacteria and infections. 4. Be extremely careful during your menstruation days:\nWhether you use disposable pads or reusable pads, remember to change your pads at least four to five times a day, depending on your menstrual flow. At night, you can opt for night pads, that allow you to sleep much safer and avoid staining at night. Make sure your pads are gel-and-perfume-free, as these types of sanitary napkins can lead to an accumulation of bacteria and thus generate bad odors. You can choose our reusable pads, for instance. They are breathable and do not cause any kind of allergy or friction during the days of menstruation.\n\nMany people sleep too much. Special care is necessary about food when any epidemic prevails. Have you seen how they clean the dishes? It is evident that even students of elite schools throw garbage on the ground even in the presence of garbage bins.

Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV\/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cf33f244-213e-42f9-91db-92167a2ada02>"]},{"passage":"When you’re roughing it, you don’t think of pampering yourself, yet there is no reason to completely neglect hygiene. Paying attention to your skin, hair, and teeth will certainly be appreciated by those around you on a particular backpacking or camping expedition. Whether you’re camping, hiking, fishing, or backpacking, the normal rules of hygiene still apply. Here’s how to keep practicing great hygiene while you’re out and about in among the outdoors. Flickr Creative Common License: Archigeek\nDry socks are very valuable when venturing throughout the outdoors. A dry, clean pair of socks is so easy to find normally but not when you’re miles from your sock drawer. Throw a few more pairs of socks in your sack before heading out. Regardless of your activity or destination, you’ll be moving a lot and on your feet a majority of the time. Wet, dirty socks attract bacteria, which leads to a host of foot issues that can last well beyond the excursion. You can hang a pair on the outside of your pack as to quicken the drying process in emergency situations. Take along a small bottle of hand sanitizer, using it frequently after touching trees, plants, and going in lakes. You will be using your hands to cook food, clean equipment, and eat. Therefore, you’ll lessen the likelihood of ingesting and coming in contact with bacteria if you make it a habit to clean your hands with the sanitizer. It’s an easy way to avoid sickness, which would be unfortunate, especially while on the trip. You won’t be able to take a shower but that doesn’t mean you won’t be able to keep yourself clean. Take along a package of baby wipes to use to clean your entire body. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to find how refreshed and cleaner you’ll feel after wiping yourself down. Nothing can replace a nice, hot shower but baby wipes do well to remove dirt and bacteria from your body parts. You can achieve the same effect with a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls but it’s easier to use the wipes. You don’t want to neglect your mouth and teeth because you’re away from your bathroom sink. Regardless of your location, it’s still important to brush, floss, and gargle with mouthwash. Place the dental essentials in your backpack. Be mindful of when spitting out your mouthwash and toothpaste. You don’t want it running into a natural body of water. Also, the smell can attract wild animals so dispose of your mouthfuls a distance away from the camp. Read on the topic further if you decide to choose dental powder rather than paste. Those with long hair may want to braid or keep it up or back with a hair tie. Those who are going to be out in the wilderness for a while may want to cover oily hair with a headband. Also, running baby powder through the hair will help with soaking up some of the excess oil. You could bring a travel-size bottle of shampoo and quickly wash your hair out with the help of a bottle of water. It’s necessary to know of the things you can go without in addition to minding the things you’ll need. For example, you don’t need to wear deodorant; in fact, it’s suggested to leave it at home because the scent will help attract bugs and wild animals. The same goes for perfumes and cologne. There is no need for it in the wilderness and it can work against you. Of course, you don’t want to smell dirty; that’s why you’ll keep your armpits clean with baby wipes and a bit of powder. You’ll get used to the ‘natural’ smell of your skin after a day or two. The weight of your backpack and the number of needed items is always a concern to those who are hiking and camping. You’ll want to balance packing too many clothes with knowing when to change and clean what you do bring. Replace sweaty shirts and pants each night with fresh clothing. It’s best to change before going to sleep for the night. Sleeping in dirty clothes makes your sleeping bag smell and it also introduces the opportunity for rashes and skin problems. Of course, you’ll want to consider the type of material. Some materials wick away sweat while feeling light on the skin. Cotton will make a sweaty shirt stick to your skin and does not feel comfortable in the rain.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6722777b-831e-48bf-b69d-b386bd34fcfb>"]},{"passage":"How to maintain personal hygiene on a trek! Vanity goes out of the window when you are in the wilderness. One is in the mountains to survive in the simplest forms like the mountain men. Because that’s how Yeti is supposed to be. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore your personal hygiene too. Spending days in the wilderness on long treks like Roopkund Trek, Pin Parvati Pass with no bath can make you stink like a raccoon and make you feel all icky and lousy. Maintaining personal hygiene on the trek is as important as keeping yourself hydrated on the trek. Not only it keeps the diseases at bay but also helps you feel fresh and vigorous for a longer time. These things can feel a bit of a struggle with no proper sanitation facilities available on the trek as we are used to back in the comfort of our homes. Here is how you can carry out your personal hygiene manners on the trek without any fuss:\n1. Making your business\nDo not defecate where you eat. Even the dogs follow this simple rule. Then why not we humans. Keep these things in mind next to you attend nature's call in the woods. - Do not make a toilet tent or dig a hole near your camp. The defecation area should be at least 50 meters away from your tent and the water source. - Dig a 6-inch deep hole for your business. A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2. Changing clothes on the trek\nHow often should you change clothes on trek? If it is a long trek, it is wise option to rotate your clothes. Segregate your hiking clothes and camping clothes. After you reach the camping site, change into clean and dry clothing. Your sweaty clothes from hiking can end up giving you body rashes and bad odor. Sleeping with soiled clothes on in your sleeping bag can really make you uncomfortable. Plus, your sleeping will bag will start to stink too. Next day, when you resume trekking, you can change back into your trekking clothes. Avoid changing into a different pair of clothes in sub-zero temperatures on the treks like Bali Pass and Goecha La unless absolutely necessary. 3. How to take a dry bath\n“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess\nYou are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:\n- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air. It’s better you leave it at home. - Change your clothes in the daytime when the temperature is comparatively warm. Working up a sweat on the trek is always wow. But it will just be a matter of few days when the flies start meandering around you if ignore your personal hygiene. Not a pretty picture, right?

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it.

How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave.

Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8966706c-efe6-4dc8-90d8-a1012608d4a6>"]},{"passage":"Westward expansion \/ manifest destiny dbq essential question: did the benefits of manifest destiny and westward expansion outweigh the negative consequences it is difficult to find a camping ground without carcasses - jg bruff, 1849. 9 reasons camping is beneficial to your health summer is the time for family vacations, fishing our campgrounds are placed in a natural setting, giving you the benefits of camping without the discomforts contact us to ask about our accommodations and amenities.

The important thing to do is keep the pH (defense mechanism against infections) of the vagina balanced. This is essential to avoid any kind of infection. It is therefore absolutely necessary to have certain care routines that do not alter the vaginal pH, thus preventing the onset of infections or any other type of discomfort. 4 Tips for correct feminine intimate hygiene. In addition to the usual hygiene methods and products, it is essential that you incorporate other care suggestions, which are essential to take care of your intimate hygiene. Pay attention to the following recommendations. Let's start! 1. Avoid using perfumed soaps:\nPerfumed soaps contain substances that, when in contact with the intimate area, could notably affect the vaginal flora. In the case of astringent soaps, these could represent greater damage because they contain a large amount of caustic soda, which immediately kills the vaginal flora. Instead, you can use glycerin soaps or specific soaps for washing the vulva. The important thing is that the type of soap used can maintain the pH of the vagina. 2. Avoid douching (unless prescribed by a doctor). Many women resort to douching to ensure \"effective cleansing\" of the intimate area, without realizing that this is a terrible idea. Most doctors do not recommend this type of douching. Why? Douching disrupts the balance of the vaginal flora. Causing a growth of irritations and infections. 3. Use cotton underwear\nPaying attention to the type of underwear you use is also important for good feminine hygiene. Try to change them daily and use preferably cotton underwear. Why cotton underwear? This type of fabric allows greater air circulation, thus preventing the generation of excessive heat and the rapid reproduction of bacteria and infections. 4. Be extremely careful during your menstruation days:\nWhether you use disposable pads or reusable pads, remember to change your pads at least four to five times a day, depending on your menstrual flow. At night, you can opt for night pads, that allow you to sleep much safer and avoid staining at night. Make sure your pads are gel-and-perfume-free, as these types of sanitary napkins can lead to an accumulation of bacteria and thus generate bad odors. You can choose our reusable pads, for instance. They are breathable and do not cause any kind of allergy or friction during the days of menstruation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:355b988e-7aad-4e79-b5d0-5489787b1766>"]},{"passage":"Many people sleep too much.

Action may include retraining or reminding staff on what they are required to do and the importance of it in terms of food safety. One should aim for at least these three habits.

Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.\nWhile you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.\nThe popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.\nThe first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?\nSecondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?\nAlso, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.\nOnce you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!\nThe forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.\nThe second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.\nSome group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.\nThe the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.\nThe performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.\nAdjourning or Mourning\nAt some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.\nImportant Note: This blog is intended for informational and discussion purposes only, and does not substitute for professional care.

Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.\n\nI then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.\n\nAdmittedly, the second half sentence “why we should communicate less” is provocative in the modern world of work, but true. But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups. Resists the temptation to coordinate everything in a big, clarifying conversation.\n\nDetails also help your teams act as a second pair of eyes for spotting potential problems down the road. The more they know about the work being done, the more help they can be to you in return. Above all, making work precise means each team member is able to complete their allotted tasks without confusion. Requirements let your teams know exactly what conditions need to be met for a task to be considered done. If you're specific enough in your task description, you may already cover the requirements of that task. However, always be sure to double check that each task lists exactly what completion looks like. There can be one requirement or several depending on the relative complexity of the task. When you set completion requirements, anyone can quickly look to see whether the job is done or not. This will help you avoid situations where your team members assume a job is done that actually isn't totally complete. The size of a task can depend on:\nYou can measure the size of a task based on any of these components, but there are certain advantages to paying attention to time, which we'll go over. Consider the following when sizing up your tasks. Obviously, it will be impossible to make your tasks completely even from all perspectives, so it's best to choose one form of measurement, and use that to dictate the size of your tasks. If you choose the length of time required to complete a task, you'll need to split all of your tasks into similarly sized time periods (e.g. ¬Ω a day or 1 day's worth of work.) To do this, you will need to split oversized tasks into smaller pieces and group smaller tasks into batches. Dividing tasks into equal amounts of work by time makes it easier to:\nAs with most recommendations we make in this guide, it will be up to you to decide what the best way of dividing your tasks up is. There's no “correct” size for tasks, but here are a few considerations to think about before making your decision:\nPro Tip: Think about how your team feels about their work. Aside from the logistical advantages to grouping your tasks into ¬Ω day or 1 day chunks, there's also a psychological advantage. When you make tasks that are achievable in a half a day or a day, your team members are able to check off at least one task per workday, giving them a sense of accomplishment each and every day they walk out of the office. By setting an assignee to every task, you attach clear responsibility to every piece of work within your project. Assigning every task is also important for transparency. Without an assignee, you‚Äîthe Project Manager‚Äîmight know the status of the task or perhaps a few members of one team, but other team members, teams, and stakeholders will not easily be able to tell the status of an unassigned task which compromises their ability to understand the progress of the project as a whole. Pro Tip: Focus on what matters. You can set a number of parameters for tasks, but the assignee and due date are the most important. As a rule of thumb, unless you have significant reason not to, always set an assignee and due date for every task. The assignee of a task acts as the point person for the work being done. Should someone have a question about that work, they should feel confident in turning to the assignee for answers. When thinking of who would be best for a task, it's important to get to know your team's strengths, weaknesses, and skills. Over time, you'll learn which types of tasks are done best by which team members, and your projects will run more efficiently. Pro Tip: Don't leave anything unassigned. If there is no appropriate person to assign a task yet, or you are the only person fully aware of every aspect of the task, assign it to yourself‚Äîeven if it's just temporarily. There may be projects where tasks require two or more team members to collaborate. It's still best to select one assignee who will act as the supervisor to that task. When multiple people are assigned to the same task, one of two mistakes can easily happen: multiple people do some of the same work or multiple people neglect a piece of the same work. When collaborating on single tasks, there are a few ways to ensure proper collaboration and communication. Pro Tip: Distribute tasks fairly, and play to your team's strengths. You'll want to ensure that each member of your teams have realistic and fair workloads.\n\nSecurity, Group Size, and the Human Brain\nIf the size of your company grows past 150 people, it’s time to get name badges. It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group\/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.\n\nAnother issue of an occasional series—Dear Adrian—in which I answer questions about event design, elementary particle physics, solar hot water systems, facilitation, and anything else I might conceivably know something about. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.\n\nThe individual plan tests the analytical ability and the discussion of the group plan sees whether the candidate is prepared to accept a superior plan over his plan or he is able to convince the group about superiority of his plan against an inferior plan being considered by the group. The candidates must properly appreciate the problem, take stock of the resources available with them and then try to generate some alternatives in the given situation. After considering the pros and cons of every alternative, best alternative should be accepted. By actively participating in the group plan discussion, the candidates should try to get themselves nominated as the group leader to get an edge over the other candidates. [You are Reading SSB Interview Process]\nNext part of GTO’s fest is the group obstacles. It has four sub-parts including Progressive Group Task, Group Obstacle Race, Half Group Task and Final Group Task. These tasks are designed to test the behaviour of a candidate in a group where there are no group leaders nominated. The GTO, therefore, keenly observes the candidates for their qualities like cooperation, group belonging feelings, natural leadership qualities, planning, initiative and task orientation. Group obstacles in all the four sub-parts are in the form of obstacles which cannot be negotiated by an individual and need a group of persons to cross it. The group is explained that within the obstacle area, in which particular parts are “out of bounds”, the entire group has to cross the obstacle within a given period of time with the assistance of tools like ropes, planks, wooden logs, etc. The progressive group task has four tasks with each successive task getting tougher and final group task is the repeat exercise to facilitate the GTO to observe only the potential candidates. The group obstacle race is in the form of an inter-group race in which they also have to carry a sack type of load while crossing the obstacles. Half group task is given by dividing the group into two sub-groups, facilitating the GTO in observing the candidates in a better manner. While crossing these obstacles, or planning to cross these, the candidates should think objectively to negotiate the obstacles with the help of given material. There are usually more than one solution to each obstacle. Immediately on getting the solution, the candidates must start asserting themselves by also seeking advice and suggestions of other candidates. Even if the candidate is unable to arrive at any solution he should try to assume the role of a mediator between several candidates having diverse solutions. Even while actually negotiating the obstacle endeavour should be to take on the most difficult tasks so that an impression of task orientation and leading by example is created in the mind of the GTO. Command Task is aimed at testing the leadership and command capabilities of candidates. In all the earlier exercises, the natural leaders are allowed to emerge. But in some cases, where there are more than one natural leaders, the strongest one will overshadow rest of them. Similarly, a person who is shy by nature, may not be able to exhibit his leadership qualities in a group of equals and hence an opportunity is given to such candidates to show their worth in a formalised situation, where they are declared leaders. In the command task the nature of obstacles and facilitating material remain the same. The only change is that one candidate is nominated as a formal leader, asked to choose his team, plans to negotiate the obstacle and finally executes the plan. The candidate’s judgement, planning and analytical capabilities are checked and his capabilities to get a task executed are also tested. The candidate must, therefore, choose his team carefully, choosing the best candidates who are cooperative and physically strong. This reflects his objective assessment of subordinates. Then the leader must explain to his men the objective or task, the facilitating material available to them and spell out the plan as to how he planned to accomplish the task. The plan should be clear and spelt out in clear and commanding manner. After explaining the task to his men, the leader should go ahead with the proper execution of the task by properly supervising and giving supplementary instructions if required. Normally, the work should be got executed from the chosen candidates, but in case some part of obstacle negotiation needs his assistance, he should be ready to do so. At times, the commander may find it difficult to plan a solution to the obstacle. Under such a situation, the commander may ask the members of the group to suggest to him the possible solution.\n\nIn this cyber age, members of groups sometimes need opportunities to build a real sense of community and learn to communicate with one another face to face. The activities in this book can be a great place to start. They help groups grow by helping members get to know and appreciate each other’s similarities and differences, engaging participants in topics and issues relevant to the group, and encouraging individual contributions. First, though, let’s look at some tips for implementing effective team-building activities. The suggestions offered in this chapter, while specific to the activities provided in this book, can be adapted to any type of team-building activity. Five Things a Facilitator Should Know\nEven though a given activity is intended as a tool for building community, it can quickly turn into a disaster that leaves group members wanting to withdraw from the process. When the facilitator is not properly prepared, or does not believe in the process, participants will sense it. Thus, in order for growth activities to be successful, you as the facilitator should know your purpose, your audience, your environment, the needed equipment and supplies, and when to change plans to adapt to the participants. Know Your Purpose\nWhile the overall purpose of all of these activities is to improve teamwork within your group, it is vital to select specific focuses to aid in the process. By clearly defining the purpose of an activity, you increase the likelihood that your group will begin to function more effectively and cohesively. Do you want the people in your group to learn each other’s names? Do you want them to learn how to think creatively? Do you want to introduce a specific topic for discussion? Choosing a specific purpose for an activity gives you and the participants more respect for the process and increases the likelihood that the group will become more cohesive because there is a clearly targeted purpose to the activity. Thus each activity presented in this book hinges on a clearly defined purpose to help you target specific areas that your group needs to address. Know Your Audience\nWill the participants include a lot of new people, or do they generally know each other already? When a group includes new people, it is best to select activities that allow participants to get to know one another. Activities such as Ringtone Relay, A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words, and What’s on Your Playlist? offer great ways to help new groups break the ice. On the other hand, groups where members know each other’s names and are familiar with each other’s tendencies in various situations might benefit more from activities such as Y3W, Self-Portraits, or Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall because these activities require a greater depth of knowledge about group members and increased self-disclosure. One of the unique aspects of the team-building activities described in this book is that they were designed to be as inclusive as possible. Rather than ask group members to swing on ropes, lift objects, or climb to the top of objects, the activities mostly call for participants to think together and collectively solve problems or create solutions. If you have group members with physical disabilities, ask them how you can help them be involved; for most of these activities, a quick conversation on the topic is all you need in order to promote optimal participation. Remember, the point is to help people feel included—like they belong. Know Your Environment\nSeveral important questions arise here. Will you have enough space for the activity? For example, if an activity requires a large open area, make sure that there is adequate space for people to move around (e.g., without bumping into chairs or people). Also, how long will the activity take? Make sure it will fit into the time period you have available. Does the activity work best for a large group or a small group? We do not list a maximum size for the activities discussed in this book; rather, we suggest that your group be split into smaller groups ranging from 2 to 5 members each. Understanding your group’s needs, as well as the suggested group sizes, will help you determine the best location for a given activity. Know What Supplies You Need\nWe all have technology-related horror stories to share. Whether it was the big presentation that didn’t work because of the wrong version of Microsoft® Office® or the vital e-mail that went nowhere due to a faulty Internet connection, we have all had our struggles with technology. As a result, we cannot overemphasize the importance of making sure that you have the necessary equipment and that it is all working correctly. Make sure that you have everything before the activity begins. Are the camera batteries charged? Is the Internet connection working properly? Do you have all the cords for the LCD projector?\n\nRemember that whatever format you choose, it s important to think through beforehand how each step of the process will work in practice, and have any necessary materials ready. 1. Go-Round A go-round is where every person gets a turn to speak in order, without interruption or direct response ( cross-talk ) by others. Aspects to get clear on before you start include: whether or not everyone is expected to speak; whether it s ok for anyone to speak a second time once all have spoken a first time; and whether the amount of time per person is limited. Sometimes the facilitator reserves the right to ask clarifying questions. It s nice if there is time for the group to talk afterward about what came up, and\/or the facilitator may offer closing remarks. Go-rounds are useful when you want to hear from every person present, when some members are reluctant to jump into a fast-paced discussion, and\/or when you feel that a slower, more deliberate method is appropriate to the subject under consideration, perhaps because it is a particularly weighty decision. This format is rarely appropriate in a group of more than 15 people. When planning a goround, think ahead about how much time it will realistically take, and consider whether there needs to be a time limit per person. (If there is a time limit, either sending a wristwatch around the circle so that whoever just spoke keeps time for the next speaker, or having a gentle chime ready for the facilitator to ring as a signal, are graceful ways to keep to the limit.) 2. Small Groups Concurrent small groups are an obvious method that should probably be used far more frequently than they are. By simple math, breaking into small groups during part of an agenda item allows a lot more people to have air time. And people who will never speak in front of a large group due to shyness may have wonderful ideas to share. The breakout groups may be anywhere from two to five people. I tend toward smaller groups (two to three people) for increased safety when the topic has a lot of emotion associated with it. Whereas groups of four to five may be good for more energy when you want people to share opinions or generate ideas. Once you get six or more people, participants have to wait longer to get a speaking turn and you start losing the benefits of small groups. At the end of the small group time, bring the full group back together by inviting people to share insights and highlights in the full group. Sharing new learnings is more useful than getting full report-backs, which tend to be boring and decrease the energy. Spending even ten minutes in small groups enables people to express their first responses to an issue very efficiently, thus deepening the level of consideration when the group starts plenary discussion. A term for short small groups in the midst of a larger plenary session is zoom groups. 12 3. Brainstorming Brainstorming is a well-known technique for eliciting as many ideas as possible in the shortest amount of time. It usually consists of having people call out ideas which are then scribed up front onto a flipchart. If people are really popping you may even need two separate charts with scribes who alternate. The basic rule of brainstorming is that no evaluative comments are allowed; that is, no one can say of another idea that it s good or bad. The point is to open up to the fullest possible creativity. At least that s the theory. Brainstorming has been studied extensively by researchers, and the results show that people do in fact tend to feel inhibited about sharing. Saying that ideas will not be judged doesn t in itself keep it from happening (even if it s in people s heads rather than out loud), and participants know this. Also not everyone can think creatively in an environment with others shouting out their ideas. So an alternate technique is to have people write ideas down anonymously onto half-sheets of paper, which are collected by the facilitator and posted at the front. An added advantage of that approach is that the ideas can then be moved around and grouped into categories. 4. Fishbowl A fishbowl consists of a subset of the whole group gathering together in one place (usually in the middle of the room) to discuss a topic while the rest of the group witnesses silently from the outer circle.\n\nGroup interview type Features Typical use Focus groups Natural group Participants selected to meet sampling criteria Seeks broad range of ideas on open-ended topic Formal, controlled pre-arranged time and place Usually audio-taped and transcribed for analysis Group exists independently of the research study Formal or informal format Interview guide loosely followed Often recorded by written notes Testing health promotion materials, exploring service users views Ethnographic data collection (informal) social research (formal) Project planning, programme evaluation (b) Advantages of group interviews One advantage of group data is that you have access to how people talk to each other. For example, in a study of clinic health workers, it was noticed that in a mixed group, nurses said very little, and tended to agree with what doctors said. If we notice these kinds of power relationships, they can inform our work for instance, in this setting, it would not be a good idea to rely on nurses to implement changes in treatment protocols. Bear in mind for focus groups what you will get is a measure of the interaction between people and your analysis will be done at the group level rather than the individual. If you want to gain access to the perspective of vulnerable or marginal people, then group interviews will not be the best way, as they may not be comfortable or able to speak in a mixed group. 19 17 (c) Practical issues If you want to organise a focus group or natural group interview, you will need to think about the following issues: How will you recruit the participants? What will you include in the topic guide? How will you run the groups? Where will you hold the sessions? How will you record the data? The recruitment of focus group participants To run group discussions, you will need people who will discuss! It is often difficult to get the participation needed and inadequate recruitment efforts are a common source of problems in research projects. Whether people will want to come will depend on how involved the researchers or their organisation are with the community, how well they understand the topic of your research, how interested the community is in the research topic, and what they think they will gain by attending the discussions. Groups typically have between 6 and 10 people. Below 6, it may be difficult to sustain a discussion; above 10, it may be difficult to control it. If you aim for 10, it is usually a good idea to over recruit by about 25%, ie recruit 13. In contexts where you expect neighbours and family to join in with the recruited member, overrecruitment may be a problem, especially in settings where it is usual for a whole community to turn up. Do think about what you would do with the extra people, or how you will manage a very large group, for example would you split the group in two? To recruit your participants, you can ask for volunteers from the population of interest, or ask for the help of gatekeepers, leaders or contacts in the community who can invite participants for you. The other option is to recruit people systematically from a sampling frame for the population of interest. So for example use the list of all patients from a particular clinic, and invite every tenth person. Obviously, if you want a natural group, you need to invite a group that already exists. You can invite one individual to invite their colleagues or other members of the household as well. Or invite all the clinic staff together. Running a group The moderator s role is crucial: you will need to provide a clear explanation of the purpose of the group, help people feel at ease and facilitate interaction between group members. The moderator will need to promote the debate by using the topic guide, sometimes challenging participants, drawing out differences in opinion, asking for details and tactfully moving things forward when the conversation is drifting. The moderator will also need to ensure that everyone speaks while not favouring any particular participant. It is usual to have two moderators, so that one can concentrate on the topic guide and managing the discussion, while the other takes notes, checks the tape\n20 18 recorders and helps with the organisation (eg meeting and greeting participants). Both can take notes on body language, attitudes etc. How many groups should you run? The general rule of thumb is that you should stop when additional data collection no longer generates new understanding, also called the saturation point. Whether you will need to run three, five or six groups will vary depending on the questions you re asking, the context, and what will be credible for your audience. Setting Make sure that you have your discussion in a quiet, comfortable place so that people feel relaxed and inclined to speak.","passages":[{"passage":"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>"]},{"passage":"I then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:13974a23-5853-426c-983d-f8bd026b4fe5>"]},{"passage":"Admittedly, the second half sentence “why we should communicate less” is provocative in the modern world of work, but true. But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups.

The more they know about the work being done, the more help they can be to you in return. Above all, making work precise means each team member is able to complete their allotted tasks without confusion. Requirements let your teams know exactly what conditions need to be met for a task to be considered done. If you're specific enough in your task description, you may already cover the requirements of that task. However, always be sure to double check that each task lists exactly what completion looks like. There can be one requirement or several depending on the relative complexity of the task. When you set completion requirements, anyone can quickly look to see whether the job is done or not. This will help you avoid situations where your team members assume a job is done that actually isn't totally complete. The size of a task can depend on:\nYou can measure the size of a task based on any of these components, but there are certain advantages to paying attention to time, which we'll go over. Consider the following when sizing up your tasks. Obviously, it will be impossible to make your tasks completely even from all perspectives, so it's best to choose one form of measurement, and use that to dictate the size of your tasks. If you choose the length of time required to complete a task, you'll need to split all of your tasks into similarly sized time periods (e.g. ¬Ω a day or 1 day's worth of work.) To do this, you will need to split oversized tasks into smaller pieces and group smaller tasks into batches. Dividing tasks into equal amounts of work by time makes it easier to:\nAs with most recommendations we make in this guide, it will be up to you to decide what the best way of dividing your tasks up is. There's no “correct” size for tasks, but here are a few considerations to think about before making your decision:\nPro Tip: Think about how your team feels about their work. Aside from the logistical advantages to grouping your tasks into ¬Ω day or 1 day chunks, there's also a psychological advantage. When you make tasks that are achievable in a half a day or a day, your team members are able to check off at least one task per workday, giving them a sense of accomplishment each and every day they walk out of the office. By setting an assignee to every task, you attach clear responsibility to every piece of work within your project. Assigning every task is also important for transparency. Without an assignee, you‚Äîthe Project Manager‚Äîmight know the status of the task or perhaps a few members of one team, but other team members, teams, and stakeholders will not easily be able to tell the status of an unassigned task which compromises their ability to understand the progress of the project as a whole. Pro Tip: Focus on what matters. You can set a number of parameters for tasks, but the assignee and due date are the most important. As a rule of thumb, unless you have significant reason not to, always set an assignee and due date for every task. The assignee of a task acts as the point person for the work being done. Should someone have a question about that work, they should feel confident in turning to the assignee for answers. When thinking of who would be best for a task, it's important to get to know your team's strengths, weaknesses, and skills. Over time, you'll learn which types of tasks are done best by which team members, and your projects will run more efficiently. Pro Tip: Don't leave anything unassigned. If there is no appropriate person to assign a task yet, or you are the only person fully aware of every aspect of the task, assign it to yourself‚Äîeven if it's just temporarily. There may be projects where tasks require two or more team members to collaborate. It's still best to select one assignee who will act as the supervisor to that task. When multiple people are assigned to the same task, one of two mistakes can easily happen: multiple people do some of the same work or multiple people neglect a piece of the same work. When collaborating on single tasks, there are a few ways to ensure proper collaboration and communication. Pro Tip: Distribute tasks fairly, and play to your team's strengths. You'll want to ensure that each member of your teams have realistic and fair workloads.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7b222247-6212-4c03-b74f-e07fa5bab293>"]},{"passage":"Security, Group Size, and the Human Brain\nIf the size of your company grows past 150 people, it’s time to get name badges. It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group\/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:665b930c-8f12-4762-9d6a-71bb33173374>"]},{"passage":"Another issue of an occasional series—Dear Adrian—in which I answer questions about event design, elementary particle physics, solar hot water systems, facilitation, and anything else I might conceivably know something about. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3a372d4c-14cc-4c24-822c-59b5c99768e2>"]},{"passage":"The individual plan tests the analytical ability and the discussion of the group plan sees whether the candidate is prepared to accept a superior plan over his plan or he is able to convince the group about superiority of his plan against an inferior plan being considered by the group. The candidates must properly appreciate the problem, take stock of the resources available with them and then try to generate some alternatives in the given situation. After considering the pros and cons of every alternative, best alternative should be accepted. By actively participating in the group plan discussion, the candidates should try to get themselves nominated as the group leader to get an edge over the other candidates. [You are Reading SSB Interview Process]\nNext part of GTO’s fest is the group obstacles. It has four sub-parts including Progressive Group Task, Group Obstacle Race, Half Group Task and Final Group Task. These tasks are designed to test the behaviour of a candidate in a group where there are no group leaders nominated. The GTO, therefore, keenly observes the candidates for their qualities like cooperation, group belonging feelings, natural leadership qualities, planning, initiative and task orientation. Group obstacles in all the four sub-parts are in the form of obstacles which cannot be negotiated by an individual and need a group of persons to cross it. The group is explained that within the obstacle area, in which particular parts are “out of bounds”, the entire group has to cross the obstacle within a given period of time with the assistance of tools like ropes, planks, wooden logs, etc. The progressive group task has four tasks with each successive task getting tougher and final group task is the repeat exercise to facilitate the GTO to observe only the potential candidates. The group obstacle race is in the form of an inter-group race in which they also have to carry a sack type of load while crossing the obstacles. Half group task is given by dividing the group into two sub-groups, facilitating the GTO in observing the candidates in a better manner. While crossing these obstacles, or planning to cross these, the candidates should think objectively to negotiate the obstacles with the help of given material. There are usually more than one solution to each obstacle. Immediately on getting the solution, the candidates must start asserting themselves by also seeking advice and suggestions of other candidates. Even if the candidate is unable to arrive at any solution he should try to assume the role of a mediator between several candidates having diverse solutions. Even while actually negotiating the obstacle endeavour should be to take on the most difficult tasks so that an impression of task orientation and leading by example is created in the mind of the GTO. Command Task is aimed at testing the leadership and command capabilities of candidates. In all the earlier exercises, the natural leaders are allowed to emerge. But in some cases, where there are more than one natural leaders, the strongest one will overshadow rest of them. Similarly, a person who is shy by nature, may not be able to exhibit his leadership qualities in a group of equals and hence an opportunity is given to such candidates to show their worth in a formalised situation, where they are declared leaders. In the command task the nature of obstacles and facilitating material remain the same. The only change is that one candidate is nominated as a formal leader, asked to choose his team, plans to negotiate the obstacle and finally executes the plan. The candidate’s judgement, planning and analytical capabilities are checked and his capabilities to get a task executed are also tested. The candidate must, therefore, choose his team carefully, choosing the best candidates who are cooperative and physically strong. This reflects his objective assessment of subordinates. Then the leader must explain to his men the objective or task, the facilitating material available to them and spell out the plan as to how he planned to accomplish the task. The plan should be clear and spelt out in clear and commanding manner. After explaining the task to his men, the leader should go ahead with the proper execution of the task by properly supervising and giving supplementary instructions if required. Normally, the work should be got executed from the chosen candidates, but in case some part of obstacle negotiation needs his assistance, he should be ready to do so. At times, the commander may find it difficult to plan a solution to the obstacle. Under such a situation, the commander may ask the members of the group to suggest to him the possible solution.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:40c11c49-5f62-43d0-b93a-e595c93b3bda>"]},{"passage":"In this cyber age, members of groups sometimes need opportunities to build a real sense of community and learn to communicate with one another face to face. The activities in this book can be a great place to start. They help groups grow by helping members get to know and appreciate each other’s similarities and differences, engaging participants in topics and issues relevant to the group, and encouraging individual contributions. First, though, let’s look at some tips for implementing effective team-building activities. The suggestions offered in this chapter, while specific to the activities provided in this book, can be adapted to any type of team-building activity. Five Things a Facilitator Should Know\nEven though a given activity is intended as a tool for building community, it can quickly turn into a disaster that leaves group members wanting to withdraw from the process. When the facilitator is not properly prepared, or does not believe in the process, participants will sense it. Thus, in order for growth activities to be successful, you as the facilitator should know your purpose, your audience, your environment, the needed equipment and supplies, and when to change plans to adapt to the participants. Know Your Purpose\nWhile the overall purpose of all of these activities is to improve teamwork within your group, it is vital to select specific focuses to aid in the process. By clearly defining the purpose of an activity, you increase the likelihood that your group will begin to function more effectively and cohesively. Do you want the people in your group to learn each other’s names? Do you want them to learn how to think creatively? Do you want to introduce a specific topic for discussion? Choosing a specific purpose for an activity gives you and the participants more respect for the process and increases the likelihood that the group will become more cohesive because there is a clearly targeted purpose to the activity. Thus each activity presented in this book hinges on a clearly defined purpose to help you target specific areas that your group needs to address. Know Your Audience\nWill the participants include a lot of new people, or do they generally know each other already? When a group includes new people, it is best to select activities that allow participants to get to know one another. Activities such as Ringtone Relay, A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words, and What’s on Your Playlist? offer great ways to help new groups break the ice. On the other hand, groups where members know each other’s names and are familiar with each other’s tendencies in various situations might benefit more from activities such as Y3W, Self-Portraits, or Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall because these activities require a greater depth of knowledge about group members and increased self-disclosure. One of the unique aspects of the team-building activities described in this book is that they were designed to be as inclusive as possible. Rather than ask group members to swing on ropes, lift objects, or climb to the top of objects, the activities mostly call for participants to think together and collectively solve problems or create solutions. If you have group members with physical disabilities, ask them how you can help them be involved; for most of these activities, a quick conversation on the topic is all you need in order to promote optimal participation. Remember, the point is to help people feel included—like they belong. Know Your Environment\nSeveral important questions arise here. Will you have enough space for the activity? For example, if an activity requires a large open area, make sure that there is adequate space for people to move around (e.g., without bumping into chairs or people). Also, how long will the activity take? Make sure it will fit into the time period you have available. Does the activity work best for a large group or a small group? We do not list a maximum size for the activities discussed in this book; rather, we suggest that your group be split into smaller groups ranging from 2 to 5 members each. Understanding your group’s needs, as well as the suggested group sizes, will help you determine the best location for a given activity. Know What Supplies You Need\nWe all have technology-related horror stories to share. Whether it was the big presentation that didn’t work because of the wrong version of Microsoft® Office® or the vital e-mail that went nowhere due to a faulty Internet connection, we have all had our struggles with technology. As a result, we cannot overemphasize the importance of making sure that you have the necessary equipment and that it is all working correctly. Make sure that you have everything before the activity begins. Are the camera batteries charged? Is the Internet connection working properly? Do you have all the cords for the LCD projector?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:38a037b5-6da7-44d6-98ce-f43b1c3c6870>"]},{"passage":"Remember that whatever format you choose, it s important to think through beforehand how each step of the process will work in practice, and have any necessary materials ready. 1. Go-Round A go-round is where every person gets a turn to speak in order, without interruption or direct response ( cross-talk ) by others. Aspects to get clear on before you start include: whether or not everyone is expected to speak; whether it s ok for anyone to speak a second time once all have spoken a first time; and whether the amount of time per person is limited. Sometimes the facilitator reserves the right to ask clarifying questions. It s nice if there is time for the group to talk afterward about what came up, and\/or the facilitator may offer closing remarks. Go-rounds are useful when you want to hear from every person present, when some members are reluctant to jump into a fast-paced discussion, and\/or when you feel that a slower, more deliberate method is appropriate to the subject under consideration, perhaps because it is a particularly weighty decision. This format is rarely appropriate in a group of more than 15 people. When planning a goround, think ahead about how much time it will realistically take, and consider whether there needs to be a time limit per person. (If there is a time limit, either sending a wristwatch around the circle so that whoever just spoke keeps time for the next speaker, or having a gentle chime ready for the facilitator to ring as a signal, are graceful ways to keep to the limit.) 2. Small Groups Concurrent small groups are an obvious method that should probably be used far more frequently than they are. By simple math, breaking into small groups during part of an agenda item allows a lot more people to have air time. And people who will never speak in front of a large group due to shyness may have wonderful ideas to share. The breakout groups may be anywhere from two to five people. I tend toward smaller groups (two to three people) for increased safety when the topic has a lot of emotion associated with it. Whereas groups of four to five may be good for more energy when you want people to share opinions or generate ideas. Once you get six or more people, participants have to wait longer to get a speaking turn and you start losing the benefits of small groups. At the end of the small group time, bring the full group back together by inviting people to share insights and highlights in the full group. Sharing new learnings is more useful than getting full report-backs, which tend to be boring and decrease the energy. Spending even ten minutes in small groups enables people to express their first responses to an issue very efficiently, thus deepening the level of consideration when the group starts plenary discussion. A term for short small groups in the midst of a larger plenary session is zoom groups. 12 3. Brainstorming Brainstorming is a well-known technique for eliciting as many ideas as possible in the shortest amount of time. It usually consists of having people call out ideas which are then scribed up front onto a flipchart. If people are really popping you may even need two separate charts with scribes who alternate. The basic rule of brainstorming is that no evaluative comments are allowed; that is, no one can say of another idea that it s good or bad. The point is to open up to the fullest possible creativity. At least that s the theory. Brainstorming has been studied extensively by researchers, and the results show that people do in fact tend to feel inhibited about sharing. Saying that ideas will not be judged doesn t in itself keep it from happening (even if it s in people s heads rather than out loud), and participants know this. Also not everyone can think creatively in an environment with others shouting out their ideas. So an alternate technique is to have people write ideas down anonymously onto half-sheets of paper, which are collected by the facilitator and posted at the front. An added advantage of that approach is that the ideas can then be moved around and grouped into categories. 4. Fishbowl A fishbowl consists of a subset of the whole group gathering together in one place (usually in the middle of the room) to discuss a topic while the rest of the group witnesses silently from the outer circle.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:68b40b99-5ba9-4116-9af6-36bd3fbccd56>"]},{"passage":"Group interview type Features Typical use Focus groups Natural group Participants selected to meet sampling criteria Seeks broad range of ideas on open-ended topic Formal, controlled pre-arranged time and place Usually audio-taped and transcribed for analysis Group exists independently of the research study Formal or informal format Interview guide loosely followed Often recorded by written notes Testing health promotion materials, exploring service users views Ethnographic data collection (informal) social research (formal) Project planning, programme evaluation (b) Advantages of group interviews One advantage of group data is that you have access to how people talk to each other. For example, in a study of clinic health workers, it was noticed that in a mixed group, nurses said very little, and tended to agree with what doctors said. If we notice these kinds of power relationships, they can inform our work for instance, in this setting, it would not be a good idea to rely on nurses to implement changes in treatment protocols. Bear in mind for focus groups what you will get is a measure of the interaction between people and your analysis will be done at the group level rather than the individual. If you want to gain access to the perspective of vulnerable or marginal people, then group interviews will not be the best way, as they may not be comfortable or able to speak in a mixed group. 19 17 (c) Practical issues If you want to organise a focus group or natural group interview, you will need to think about the following issues: How will you recruit the participants? What will you include in the topic guide? How will you run the groups? Where will you hold the sessions? How will you record the data? The recruitment of focus group participants To run group discussions, you will need people who will discuss! It is often difficult to get the participation needed and inadequate recruitment efforts are a common source of problems in research projects. Whether people will want to come will depend on how involved the researchers or their organisation are with the community, how well they understand the topic of your research, how interested the community is in the research topic, and what they think they will gain by attending the discussions. Groups typically have between 6 and 10 people. Below 6, it may be difficult to sustain a discussion; above 10, it may be difficult to control it. If you aim for 10, it is usually a good idea to over recruit by about 25%, ie recruit 13. In contexts where you expect neighbours and family to join in with the recruited member, overrecruitment may be a problem, especially in settings where it is usual for a whole community to turn up. Do think about what you would do with the extra people, or how you will manage a very large group, for example would you split the group in two? To recruit your participants, you can ask for volunteers from the population of interest, or ask for the help of gatekeepers, leaders or contacts in the community who can invite participants for you. The other option is to recruit people systematically from a sampling frame for the population of interest. So for example use the list of all patients from a particular clinic, and invite every tenth person. Obviously, if you want a natural group, you need to invite a group that already exists. You can invite one individual to invite their colleagues or other members of the household as well. Or invite all the clinic staff together. Running a group The moderator s role is crucial: you will need to provide a clear explanation of the purpose of the group, help people feel at ease and facilitate interaction between group members. The moderator will need to promote the debate by using the topic guide, sometimes challenging participants, drawing out differences in opinion, asking for details and tactfully moving things forward when the conversation is drifting. The moderator will also need to ensure that everyone speaks while not favouring any particular participant. It is usual to have two moderators, so that one can concentrate on the topic guide and managing the discussion, while the other takes notes, checks the tape\n20 18 recorders and helps with the organisation (eg meeting and greeting participants). Both can take notes on body language, attitudes etc. How many groups should you run? The general rule of thumb is that you should stop when additional data collection no longer generates new understanding, also called the saturation point. Whether you will need to run three, five or six groups will vary depending on the questions you re asking, the context, and what will be credible for your audience. Setting Make sure that you have your discussion in a quiet, comfortable place so that people feel relaxed and inclined to speak.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3dbe7d74-69cc-4196-adb4-c6a169a35e0b>"]}]}

Trellis has made it easy to seamlessly issue a refund to your payment purchasers. We’ll walk you through the steps that will allow you to start issuing refunds in only a few minutes. Fee Breakdown with Refunds:\nTrellis supports the ability to refund charges made to your account, either in whole or in part. If the original charge underwent currency conversion, the refunded amount is converted back using the same process. There are no fees to refund a charge, but the fees from the original charge are not returned. Ex: Customer makes a purchase of $100 on Trellis. 4.9% + $0.4 is charged on this purchase. Organization has set fees to be paid by the customer. Total charge to Customer is $105.57 and $100 is sent to the organizer's account. Refund is issued of $105.57 to the customer\n4.9% + $0.4 is not refundable so $5.57 is displayed as negative on the organization’s account. Future transactions will be offset against this amount. How to Process a Refund:\nTo start, navigate to the Results tab on the left, and on the dropdown hit the Donations and Tickets button. On the right you will see a tab labelled Viewing, where you can select if you’d like to refund either a ticket or a donation. From here you can find and select the checkout order you would like to refund. Press the Refund button and from there you can decide whether you would like to issue a full or partial refund to the purchaser. You can also provide any notes to the support team that will allow us to better serve you. Important Refund Info:\nWe submit refund requests to your customer’s bank or card issuer immediately. Your customer sees the refund as a credit approximately 5-10 business days later, depending upon the bank. Once issued, a refund cannot be canceled. Disputes and chargebacks aren’t possible on credit card charges that are fully refunded. We’ll also send an email to your customer notifying them of the refund, if all of these conditions apply:\nSome refunds—those issued shortly after the original charge—appear in the form of a reversal instead of a refund. In the case of a reversal, the original charge drops off the customer’s statement, and a separate credit is not issued. Refunds can be sent back only to the original payment method used in a charge. It’s not possible to send a refund to a different destination (e.g., another card or bank account). Refunds to expired or canceled cards are handled by the customer’s card issuer and, in most cases, credited to the customer’s replacement card. If no replacement exists, the card issuer usually delivers the refund to the customer using an alternate method (e.g., check or bank account deposit).\n\nHow to get refunds?

In order to enhance the classification to the more serious version for a second OWI, the prior conviction or related charge must have occurred within the last 12 years from the date of the new offense. Any OWI conviction or deferred judgment during that time period counts. Even convictions that occurred outside of the State of Iowa count. The penalties for a second OWI also vary slightly depending on whether the case involves a chemical test of the breath, blood or urine, or a refusal to submit to the test. Other consequences of a second or subsequent OWI arrest in Des Moines, Iowa, includes the fact that an officer can immediately impound the driver’s vehicle. A second conviction for OWI can result in at the seizure and forfeiture of the vehicle.

Second OWI Information Center\n- Penalties for a Second OWI in Iowa\n- What Counts as a Second OWI Conviction in Iowa\n- Finding an Iowa Attorney for a Second OWI\nThe laws in Iowa provide for the following penalties and punishments for a second OWI:\n- Incarceration Time: The law provides for a minimum jail sentence of 7 days in county jail that must be served on consecutive days. The 7 day sentence is a minimum mandatory penalties meaning that the judge can not suspended this requirement. The maximum jail sentence is up to 24 months in the county jail. Under limited circumstances the court may order the person to serve the minimum sentence in 48 hour segments if the jail sentences creates an undo hardship or if there is not sufficient space in the jail. - Fines: The minimum fines are $1,875 and the maximum fines are $6,250. The court is able to order community service hours to be performed instead of the fine amount. - Suspension: For a second OWI, the court must impose a driver's license revocation for 2-years. During that time, the driver is not eligible for a temporary restricted license during the first year. Prior to reinstatement, the driver must obtain SR22 showing proof of financial responsibility, the ignition interlock must be installed, and the driver must by a $200 civil penalty. - Substance Abuse Treatment: After a conviction, the driver is required to complete a substance abuse evaluation and recommended follow up treatment. - Driver’s license revocation:\n- Chemical Test: If the individual took the chemical test and had a BAC over .08 then the revocation is for one year with a one year hard suspension. - Work Permit: The hard suspension refers to the time during which no work permit is allowed. Additionally, if the person is convicted of a second OWI, then the individual must install the ignition interlock device (IID) before the driver’s license is reinstated. - Refusal: If the individual refused the test then the revocation is for two years with a one year hard suspension. - Work Permit: The hard suspension refers to the time during which no work permit is allowed. Additionally, the ignition interlock device must be installed before the individual is eligible for the work permit. - Treatment; In addition to the minimum mandatory penalties, for a second OWI conviction the court can require the person to undergo inpatient treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction. The time that the person spends in the inpatient treatment shall be credited against the defendant's sentence. The degree or severity of a particular OWI offense is determined by the number of OWI convictions that occurred within the previous 12 years. Iowa Code § 321.12(4). The \"look-back\" provision for determining if this offense is a second OWI is by looking at the period from the date of the oldest conviction to the date of the most current arrest. State v. Raim, 381 N.W.2d 635, 637-638 (Iowa 1986).\n\n1. a. The commissioner of public safety, the director of transportation, and the director of natural resources, acting jointly, shall adopt a uniform, combined citation and complaint which shall be used for charging all traffic violations in Iowa under state law or local regulation or ordinance, and which shall be used for charging all other violations which are designated by section 805.8 to be scheduled violations. The filing fees and court costs in cases of parking meter and overtime parking violations which are denied are as stated in section 602.8106, subsection 1. The court costs in scheduled violation cases where a court appearance is not required are as stated in section 602.8106, subsection 1. The court costs in scheduled violation cases where a court appearance is required are as stated in section 602.8106, subsection 1. This subsection does not prevent the charging of any of those violations by information, by private complaint filed under chapter 804, or by a simple notice of fine where permitted by section 321.236, subsection 1. Each uniform citation and complaint shall be serially numbered and shall be in quintuplicate, and the officer shall deliver the original and a copy to the court where the defendant is to appear, two copies to the defendant, and a copy to the law enforcement agency of the officer. The court shall forward an abstract of the uniform citation and complaint in accordance with section 321.491 when applicable. The uniform citation and complaint shall contain spaces for the parties' names; the address of the alleged offender; the registration number of the offender's vehicle; the information required by section 805.2, a warning which states, \"I hereby swear and affirm that the information provided by me on this citation is true under penalty of providing false information\"; and a statement that providing false information is a violation of section 719.3; a list of the scheduled fines prescribed by section 805.8, either separately or by group, and a statement of the court costs payable in scheduled violation cases, whether or not a court appearance is required or is demanded; a brief explanation of sections 805.9 and 805.10; and a space where the defendant may sign an admission of the violation when permitted by section 805.9; and the uniform citation and complaint shall require that the defendant appear before a court at a specified time and place. The uniform citation and complaint also may contain a space for the imprint of a credit card, and may contain any other information which the commissioner of public safety and the director of natural resources may determine. Notwithstanding other contrary requirements of this section, a uniform citation and complaint may be originated from a computerized device. The officer issuing the citation through a computerized device shall obtain electronically the signature of the person cited as provided in section 805.3 and shall give two copies of the citation to the person cited and shall provide a record of the citation to the court where the person cited is to appear and to the law enforcement agency of the officer by an electronic process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for accurately and legibly reproducing an unaltered image or copy of the citation. b. The uniform citation and complaint shall contain the following:\n(1) A promise to appear as provided in section 805.3. (2) The following statement: Q $KIP$ 1\nI hereby give my unsecured appearance bond in the amount of $DTL4@ dollars and enter my written appearance. I agree that if I fail to appear in person or by counsel to defend against the offense charged in this citation the court is authorized to enter a conviction and render judgment against me for the amount of my appearance bond in satisfaction of the penalty plus court costs. Q $KIP$ 1\n(3) A space immediately below the items in subparagraphs (1) and (2) for the signature of the person being charged which shall serve for each of the items in subparagraphs (1) and (2). c. Unless the officer issuing the citation arrests the alleged offender, or permits admission or requires submission of bail as provided in section 805.9, subsection 3, the officer shall enter in the blank contained in the statement required by paragraph \"b\" one of the following amounts and shall require the person to sign the written appearance:\n(1) If the offense is one to which a scheduled fine is applicable, an amount equal to one and one-half times the scheduled fine plus court costs.\n\nStudents in my first class came up with this list:\n- Keep them after school\/at recess to compensate for Mrs. G's time\n- Have them do clerical work for Mrs. G.\n- They can't take a retake next time (some said this could occur after multiple offenses)\n- Write retake time on a sticky note and put it on desk or on accordion folder\n- Mrs. G chooses\/assigns retake times\n- Write an appology letter for not showing up\n- Reward those who come\n- Start a student-led retake punishment committee\nThe second class came up with this list:\n- If you don't show up, you can't take a retake the next time (or forever)\n- Detention for 30 min. or working with the janitor for 1 hour\n- Come in the next day\n- Post a schedule in my room and the other 6th grade teacher's room\n- Reschedule if you can't make it\n- Remind yourself with a sticky note (and a discussion occured as to the various places you could put the sticky note, including their forehead)\n- Write it down in your planner\n- No show = no recess for 1 week\n- Post a reminder in your locker\n- Take points off\n- Give them lots of homework\n- Help the teacher (to make up for her time)\n- Put the no show students' names on the morning announcements for embarassment\n- Write an \"I'm sorry\" letter\n- Write \"I'm sorry\" repeatedly\nOverall, I don't think the students or I really came to a conclusion as to any punishment for not showing up. In both classes, they came to realize that any punishment would result in even more of my time being wasted. Also, we discussed how taking points off (2nd class's idea) doesn't go along with my s-b grading at all. In both classes, we discussed how it all comes down to effort and responsibility. I told them that my brother, a high school math teacher (Matt Townsley), questioned if 6th graders were really responsible\/capable enough to handle the retakes system. Both classes said they were. They said if people are showing up, it shows that anyone can be capable of showing up. I ended the conversation with saying that I hope the next time they sign up for a retake, they keep this conversation in mind. Even though the 2nd class said posting a schedule would take up my time, I still might consider doing it to see if it helps at all. But, if they write it down in their planners and don't look at those, will they look at a schedule?\n\nFifteen years ago, my attendance policy in media ethics class was considered so unusual that The Chronicle of Higher Education did a news story about it, titled, \\”Ohio U. Professor Will Take Any Excuse for Students\\’ Absences.\\”\nThe article, still online, shared my reason for accepting any excuse, as long as a test or project was not scheduled for that day. I wanted students to assess their priorities. What was more important — attending class, or nursing a hangover from a Thursday night on the town? I continued to teach at Ohio until 2003, when I became director of the journalism school at Iowa State University. My contract was entirely administrative. In other words, I did not teach a class again until the fall 2012 semester, when I took over the media ethics class of a faculty member who passed away suddenly. (See the essay \\”24 Hours\\” in Inside Higher Ed.) More on classroom absences momentarily. As an administrator, on a few occasions, I had to cope not only with stringent attendance policies of faculty but also their own attendance in assigned classes. Case in point: In 2009, my administrative team began to see declining enrollments in our degree programs in advertising and journalism and mass communication. We identified two primary causes for the drop in pre-majors. We were requiring an \\”English Usage Test\\” before students could become our majors, and it seemed that students were not getting sufficient instruction in high school on grammar, spelling and syntax — essential in our disciplines. Then we discovered the attendance policy in our required orientation class. Students failed the course if they missed one, yes one, class. We changed that attendance policy in 2010. As director, I have had to take action on occasion when instructors cancel too many classes. Official Iowa State policy states that faculty members are \\”required to be on duty during the academic year on those days when classes are in session.\\” Professors may arrange for others to manage their responsibilities when they are away from campus while classes are in session. However, before professors can take time off for personal or professional reasons, they are expected to fill out a form specifying dates they will be gone and how their courses and other obligations will be covered. Of course, accidents, emergencies and illness can strike without warning. In those cases, we ask that the instructor contact the main office so we can post information on classroom doors or arrange for others to take over classes. We do not police these policies, but we do expect faculty to adhere to them. You may want to consider that level of trust with your students. After taking over our media ethics class, with one day’s preparation, I had to create a new syllabus within hours. That’s when I decided to implement the attendance policy that attracted so much attention at Ohio University in 1997. Here’s an excerpt:\nYou can miss as many lectures as you like, as long as an exam or project is not due that day. Simply write a brief e-mail to me explaining the real reason for the absence. The only requirement is that you tell the truth. Do not say you were ill if you overslept, for instance. Do not invade your own or another person’s privacy in telling the truth (i.e., simply say you had a medical appointment – don’t explain symptoms). Send the e-mail to me before you miss the scheduled lecture or deliver it within 24 hours. Note: Title your absence email \\”462 Absence.\\”\nThe attendance policy also has a section for late and early departures from class. Nothing can be more disturbing to the instructor or the class as a tardy student clumsily opening the door during lecture or a student leaving before the lecture ends. The latter also suggests something the teacher said was so disturbing that students just had to leave when they really only had to relieve themselves. So I designate a row of chairs near the exit as \\”liberty seats,\\” meaning students may come and go as they please if they sit in that row. But what about students who violate the attendance or seating policy? Again, an excerpt from the syllabus:\nFailure to Follow Attendance Rules: If you miss a class without e-mailing an excuse letter, your final grade will drop by 50 points out of 1000 for each occurrence.\n\n2013 ORS § 153.992¹\nPenalty for failure to appear\n(1) A person commits the offense of failure to appear in a violation proceeding if the person has been served with a violation citation issued under this chapter and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:\n(a) Make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 (Appearance by defendant) within the time allowed. (b) Make appearance at the time set for trial in the violation proceeding. (c) Appear at any other time required by the court or by law. (2) Failure to appear on a violation citation is a Class A misdemeanor. [1999 c.1051 §29]\n\nCelebrating Legal Excellence has recognized Attorney Matthew T.

What's going to happen? Will I be fired? CDL'S & Iowa's owi's\nOperating While Intoxicated charges are difficult enough on the everyday working person but when they involve commercial driving privileges they have a direct and immediate impact on the person’s livelihood. Anytime an individual with a commercial driver’s license is arrested for operating while intoxicated, whether while driving a commercial vehicle or their own private vehicle, their commercial driving privileges are in jeopardy. The legal alcohol concentration limit for operating a commercial motor vehicle is .04. In the event that an individual is arrested for operating while intoxicated and either “fails” chemical testing or “refuses” chemical testing, their privilege to operate both a commercial and commercial vehicle are immediately disqualified just as they ordinarily are in commercial license cases. The licensee has the right to appeal and the same processes apply. Likewise the individual is prosecuted on the criminal charge of operating a commercial vehicle while intoxicated and the same procedures as an ordinary operating while intoxicated charge also apply. The more complicated situation arises when a person with a commercial driver’s license is arrested for operating while intoxicated but is operating their own private, commercial vehicle. In these situations the Department of Transportation is not authorized to disqualify the individual’s commercial driving privileges until there is a final resolution of the criminal charge or the administrative license suspension appeal. The current implied consent advisory read to the person following their arrest but prior to their decision regarding chemical testing advises the individual that his commercial driving privileges will be disqualified regardless of whether he consents to chemical testing and fails or refuses chemical testing. The period that a commercial driver’s license may be disqualified for a first offense of operating while intoxicated in a private vehicle is currently subject to considerable debate and litigation. Defense attorneys contend that the law only allows a person’s driving privileges to be disqualified for the same amount of times as their commercial driving privileges while the Department of Transportation attempts to disqualify them for an entire year either way. This issue is currently on appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court and should be resolved within the next 6 months. owi-dui.com can help\nIowa's Best Drunk Driving Defense Attorneys are represented here on owi-dui.com.

How will I know who’s who, who’s lying and more, if I don’t also take roll? Well, I can download photos of my students from the registrar’s office so that I can identify them if I have to over time. In other words, students may be able to get away with skipping class and not emailing me initially — which only encourages future infractions — but sooner or later I catch up with them and their lies. And remember, this is a media ethics class. If you lie in any ethics class, you go to hell — literally, I tell them. But the best part of the attendance policy is compiling the class report detailing just why students miss class. Here are a few examples, names withheld, of course, from last semester’s ethics class:\nIt just so happens, tomorrow is my birthday. Not just any birthday you see, and I know you like us to be honest; it’s my 21st … at midnight, tonight. I should also add, I am a senior and the last person I know to turn 21. So, I have this weird feeling that tomorrow\\’s 9 a.m. class is going to come up and hit me like a brick wall. I don\\’t think I\\’ll make it, but hey, you never know! I could rally! I was absent for 462 yesterday and here’s the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God. While I was walking to class, a raccoon was in my path that was squirming and running around. I knew something was wrong since it was out in the daylight, so I called animal control. They asked me to keep an eye on it so it wouldn’t run away (although I’m not sure how much help I would have been if it had). By the time the animal control woman arrived, I was 30 minutes late for class with a 10-minute walk ahead of me. I didn’t want to be rude and show up that late, so I didn’t come into class. As a final gesture to students, I post a chart that summarizes why they missed class and why others who had taken the class previously also missed. Categories include:\nWhat surprised me was how reasons for missing class at Iowa State in 2012 were so similar to reasons at Ohio in 1992-2003. The world has changed so much since then, especially in the digital classroom. Nobody missed class because of Facebook, for instance. In fact, the only technology-related absence concerned a student missing class from Oct. 29 through Nov. 2 to attend a Microsoft conference in Seattle. Also consider this: Stringent attendance policies may be necessary in small workshops, labs or other group-related classes. I get that. I also know we’re very good at finding reasons why students should attend our classes but usually not very informed about why they actually skip. In the end, it’s their tuition dollar and their grade. As I explained to my class, my attendance policy may look lenient at first blush, but I also can document that students with the fewest absences also almost always boast the highest grades. There is a correlation there, and I have the data to prove it.

Each time, you will be required to submit a participation self-evaluation to me, which I will take into careful consideration as I evaluate your participation grade. Grade Distribution: Essay 1--due Friday, Feb. 22 15% Speech 1--due the week of March 11 15% Essay 2--due Friday, April 19 20% Speech 2--due the week of May 6 20% Participation 15% Informal Assignments and Reading Responses 15% Total: 100%\nYou may access your grades on ICON at any time during the semester, and you are always welcome to schedule a meeting with me to discuss them in more detail. Your final grade will be determined on the University’s A-F grade scale. There is no final examination in this course. 24\/7 Policy: When I turn back assignments, you may have questions about your grade, the comments, or the content of the paper or speech. I employ a 24\/7 policy in resolving such questions. Please set up an appointment to speak with me at least 24 hours after and no more than one week after your grade has been issued. Be aware that the 24\/7 period begins when I hand back the assignment, regardless of whether you are present in class that day to pick it up. Attendance & Participation: Attendance is required and is therefore not rewarded. Points may be deducted for absences or lack of participation in class. Students are expected to attend every meeting (unless you have an excused absence). As noted above, your active, thoughtful and informed participation is worth 15% of your final grade. Successful participation in the course will require considerable time, thought, and energy both during class and in outside preparation. Each student will be expected to make an active, informed, thoughtful contribution to each session. You will need to demonstrate that you have read the assigned readings completely, with a sufficient level of engagement to help further discussion. This does not mean just summarizing the point of the reading to demonstrate basic understanding; you should use your understanding of the reading as a starting point, proceeding to make an inference of your own, to agree or disagree, or to bring up a relevant point or example that pushes the discussion forward. Show that you are listening carefully and thoughtfully to the contributions of your classmates, and incorporate their thoughts into your own response whenever possible. In class discussions, weekly reading responses, and peer workshops, your comments should further the conversation, advance or clarify your point of view, or encourage others to respond. Rather than each student making statements directed at the instructor, our discussions should involve a web of interactions amongst peers; the conversation will be more interesting and more fruitful if it involves every member of the class. Excused Absences and Late Work: According to University policy, absences from class are excused in the following circumstances:\nIllness or injury. Mandatory religious obligations – must be documented and arranged in advance. Authorized University activities – must be documented and arranged in advance. If you have a conscientious objection to course material covered that day, you may chose not to come, and may be asked to complete an alternate assignment or activity. See UI Operations Manual III.15.2f). Must be arranged in advance: I always give warning for content or activities that might fall under this category. Late work is acceptable only by arrangement with me, and it may not always be logistically possible for you to make up a public oral presentation even if an absence is excused. I will try to accommodate you but if class is unable to accommodate an audience for your speech, you may not be able to meet the requirement for public presentation of the speech. Work missed during excused absences (those caused by documented illnesses, family emergencies, religious obligations, or authorized University activities) can be made up; if possible, contact me in advance to make arrangements regarding such absences. In all cases, I require documentation. I may ask you to complete the Registrar's “Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class” form, which is available at http:\/\/www.registrar.uiowa.edu\/Student\/Forms forStudents\/tabid79\/Default.aspx. Students are responsible for providing documentation for excused absences, and for finding out about work missed during absences. I generally do not accept unexcused late assignments. You may be penalized for work missed during unexcused absences, including participation in discussion and other class activities.\n\nThere may be ways to keep this charge of your record in addition to avoiding jail time. Much more is needed to determine that however, for example, your background and the facts of the case. Contact an attorney. I have three past OWI convictions in Wisconsin, But now I have moved to Illinois and have a clean driving record for the last 6 years. If I were to ever get pulled over for an OWI in Illinois, would they count it as my fourth conviction? Or would it be the first strike on my Illinois license? The county that it occurs in is irrelevant. The judge you are in front of will matter. And your attorneys ability to defend you will be significant as well.

Interviewer: But it is safe to say it would be a lot easier and the outcome would be more certain if you had an attorney at your side instead of representing yourself. Jack O’Donnell: That’s right. This is because no two judges are the same as far as granting admittance into these programs. This is why it’s just prudent to have an experienced attorney who can advise you on all aspects of the program and evaluate whether or not you should even be applying for the program. Does Your DWI Case Have Valid Defensible Issues? It Is Possible That the Alcohol Education Program Isn’t the Best Option\nFor example, maybe there are some defensible issues in this particular case and you make the prosecutor take a long, hard look at it. Then, the alcohol program would be a fallback position as opposed to your go-to option. Interviewer: If the alcohol education program is not an option, what are the possible penalties someone will face for a first time DUI? First-Time DWI Offenders May Face a Six Month Jail Sentence; More Likely the Penalties Will Comprise Fines, Probation and a License Suspension\nJack O’Donnell: The possible penalty is six months in jail. However, you are not likely to be sentenced six months in jail unless something really egregious transpired. Your license will be suspended and then you’d be placed on probation for 18 months. There’d be a $500 fine, probation costs of $200 and court costs would get you up to almost $795. First-Time Offenders May Be Eligible for a Permit to Drive to and from Their Place of Employment\nConnecticut still may issue a work permit that enables driving to and from work. However, that’s only for our first-timer offenders who are subject to the 90-day license suspension. The work permit serves as a partial driving privilege restoration for those 90 days. Driver’s with License Suspensions for Twelve Months Will Be Required to Install an Ignition Interlock Device in Order to Drive within That Year\nIf you lost your license for 120 days, you can get the work permit for 120 days, but if you lost it for a year, you had no ability to go to work. They now order the installation of an ignition interlock device, which is now available to people after 45 days. However, in that case, you are still without a license for 45 days.","passages":[{"passage":"If you are charged with committing a second OWI offense, then a conviction results in a charge for an aggravated misdemeanor. In order to enhance the classification to the more serious version for a second OWI, the prior conviction or related charge must have occurred within the last 12 years from the date of the new offense. Any OWI conviction or deferred judgment during that time period counts. Even convictions that occurred outside of the State of Iowa count. The penalties for a second OWI also vary slightly depending on whether the case involves a chemical test of the breath, blood or urine, or a refusal to submit to the test.

Second OWI Information Center\n- Penalties for a Second OWI in Iowa\n- What Counts as a Second OWI Conviction in Iowa\n- Finding an Iowa Attorney for a Second OWI\nThe laws in Iowa provide for the following penalties and punishments for a second OWI:\n- Incarceration Time: The law provides for a minimum jail sentence of 7 days in county jail that must be served on consecutive days. The 7 day sentence is a minimum mandatory penalties meaning that the judge can not suspended this requirement. The maximum jail sentence is up to 24 months in the county jail. Under limited circumstances the court may order the person to serve the minimum sentence in 48 hour segments if the jail sentences creates an undo hardship or if there is not sufficient space in the jail. - Fines: The minimum fines are $1,875 and the maximum fines are $6,250. The court is able to order community service hours to be performed instead of the fine amount. - Suspension: For a second OWI, the court must impose a driver's license revocation for 2-years. During that time, the driver is not eligible for a temporary restricted license during the first year. Prior to reinstatement, the driver must obtain SR22 showing proof of financial responsibility, the ignition interlock must be installed, and the driver must by a $200 civil penalty. - Substance Abuse Treatment: After a conviction, the driver is required to complete a substance abuse evaluation and recommended follow up treatment. - Driver’s license revocation:\n- Chemical Test: If the individual took the chemical test and had a BAC over .08 then the revocation is for one year with a one year hard suspension. - Work Permit: The hard suspension refers to the time during which no work permit is allowed. Additionally, if the person is convicted of a second OWI, then the individual must install the ignition interlock device (IID) before the driver’s license is reinstated. - Refusal: If the individual refused the test then the revocation is for two years with a one year hard suspension. - Work Permit: The hard suspension refers to the time during which no work permit is allowed. Additionally, the ignition interlock device must be installed before the individual is eligible for the work permit. - Treatment; In addition to the minimum mandatory penalties, for a second OWI conviction the court can require the person to undergo inpatient treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction. The time that the person spends in the inpatient treatment shall be credited against the defendant's sentence. The degree or severity of a particular OWI offense is determined by the number of OWI convictions that occurred within the previous 12 years. Iowa Code § 321.12(4). The \"look-back\" provision for determining if this offense is a second OWI is by looking at the period from the date of the oldest conviction to the date of the most current arrest. State v.

I ended the conversation with saying that I hope the next time they sign up for a retake, they keep this conversation in mind.

Professor Will Take Any Excuse for Students\\’ Absences.\\”\nThe article, still online, shared my reason for accepting any excuse, as long as a test or project was not scheduled for that day. I wanted students to assess their priorities. What was more important — attending class, or nursing a hangover from a Thursday night on the town? I continued to teach at Ohio until 2003, when I became director of the journalism school at Iowa State University. My contract was entirely administrative. In other words, I did not teach a class again until the fall 2012 semester, when I took over the media ethics class of a faculty member who passed away suddenly. (See the essay \\”24 Hours\\” in Inside Higher Ed.) More on classroom absences momentarily. As an administrator, on a few occasions, I had to cope not only with stringent attendance policies of faculty but also their own attendance in assigned classes. Case in point: In 2009, my administrative team began to see declining enrollments in our degree programs in advertising and journalism and mass communication. We identified two primary causes for the drop in pre-majors. We were requiring an \\”English Usage Test\\” before students could become our majors, and it seemed that students were not getting sufficient instruction in high school on grammar, spelling and syntax — essential in our disciplines. Then we discovered the attendance policy in our required orientation class. Students failed the course if they missed one, yes one, class. We changed that attendance policy in 2010. As director, I have had to take action on occasion when instructors cancel too many classes. Official Iowa State policy states that faculty members are \\”required to be on duty during the academic year on those days when classes are in session.\\” Professors may arrange for others to manage their responsibilities when they are away from campus while classes are in session. However, before professors can take time off for personal or professional reasons, they are expected to fill out a form specifying dates they will be gone and how their courses and other obligations will be covered. Of course, accidents, emergencies and illness can strike without warning. In those cases, we ask that the instructor contact the main office so we can post information on classroom doors or arrange for others to take over classes. We do not police these policies, but we do expect faculty to adhere to them. You may want to consider that level of trust with your students. After taking over our media ethics class, with one day’s preparation, I had to create a new syllabus within hours. That’s when I decided to implement the attendance policy that attracted so much attention at Ohio University in 1997. Here’s an excerpt:\nYou can miss as many lectures as you like, as long as an exam or project is not due that day. Simply write a brief e-mail to me explaining the real reason for the absence. The only requirement is that you tell the truth. Do not say you were ill if you overslept, for instance. Do not invade your own or another person’s privacy in telling the truth (i.e., simply say you had a medical appointment – don’t explain symptoms). Send the e-mail to me before you miss the scheduled lecture or deliver it within 24 hours. Note: Title your absence email \\”462 Absence.\\”\nThe attendance policy also has a section for late and early departures from class. Nothing can be more disturbing to the instructor or the class as a tardy student clumsily opening the door during lecture or a student leaving before the lecture ends. The latter also suggests something the teacher said was so disturbing that students just had to leave when they really only had to relieve themselves. So I designate a row of chairs near the exit as \\”liberty seats,\\” meaning students may come and go as they please if they sit in that row. But what about students who violate the attendance or seating policy? Again, an excerpt from the syllabus:\nFailure to Follow Attendance Rules: If you miss a class without e-mailing an excuse letter, your final grade will drop by 50 points out of 1000 for each occurrence.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c1085d66-4631-4a4a-879f-db249622d01b>"]},{"passage":"2013 ORS § 153.992¹\nPenalty for failure to appear\n(1) A person commits the offense of failure to appear in a violation proceeding if the person has been served with a violation citation issued under this chapter and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:\n(a) Make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 (Appearance by defendant) within the time allowed.

What's going to happen? Will I be fired? CDL'S & Iowa's owi's\nOperating While Intoxicated charges are difficult enough on the everyday working person but when they involve commercial driving privileges they have a direct and immediate impact on the person’s livelihood. Anytime an individual with a commercial driver’s license is arrested for operating while intoxicated, whether while driving a commercial vehicle or their own private vehicle, their commercial driving privileges are in jeopardy. The legal alcohol concentration limit for operating a commercial motor vehicle is .04. In the event that an individual is arrested for operating while intoxicated and either “fails” chemical testing or “refuses” chemical testing, their privilege to operate both a commercial and commercial vehicle are immediately disqualified just as they ordinarily are in commercial license cases. The licensee has the right to appeal and the same processes apply. Likewise the individual is prosecuted on the criminal charge of operating a commercial vehicle while intoxicated and the same procedures as an ordinary operating while intoxicated charge also apply. The more complicated situation arises when a person with a commercial driver’s license is arrested for operating while intoxicated but is operating their own private, commercial vehicle. In these situations the Department of Transportation is not authorized to disqualify the individual’s commercial driving privileges until there is a final resolution of the criminal charge or the administrative license suspension appeal. The current implied consent advisory read to the person following their arrest but prior to their decision regarding chemical testing advises the individual that his commercial driving privileges will be disqualified regardless of whether he consents to chemical testing and fails or refuses chemical testing. The period that a commercial driver’s license may be disqualified for a first offense of operating while intoxicated in a private vehicle is currently subject to considerable debate and litigation. Defense attorneys contend that the law only allows a person’s driving privileges to be disqualified for the same amount of times as their commercial driving privileges while the Department of Transportation attempts to disqualify them for an entire year either way. This issue is currently on appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court and should be resolved within the next 6 months. owi-dui.com can help\nIowa's Best Drunk Driving Defense Attorneys are represented here on owi-dui.com.

How will I know who’s who, who’s lying and more, if I don’t also take roll? Well, I can download photos of my students from the registrar’s office so that I can identify them if I have to over time. In other words, students may be able to get away with skipping class and not emailing me initially — which only encourages future infractions — but sooner or later I catch up with them and their lies. And remember, this is a media ethics class. If you lie in any ethics class, you go to hell — literally, I tell them. But the best part of the attendance policy is compiling the class report detailing just why students miss class. Here are a few examples, names withheld, of course, from last semester’s ethics class:\nIt just so happens, tomorrow is my birthday. Not just any birthday you see, and I know you like us to be honest; it’s my 21st … at midnight, tonight. I should also add, I am a senior and the last person I know to turn 21. So, I have this weird feeling that tomorrow\\’s 9 a.m. class is going to come up and hit me like a brick wall. I don\\’t think I\\’ll make it, but hey, you never know! I could rally! I was absent for 462 yesterday and here’s the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God. While I was walking to class, a raccoon was in my path that was squirming and running around. I knew something was wrong since it was out in the daylight, so I called animal control. They asked me to keep an eye on it so it wouldn’t run away (although I’m not sure how much help I would have been if it had). By the time the animal control woman arrived, I was 30 minutes late for class with a 10-minute walk ahead of me. I didn’t want to be rude and show up that late, so I didn’t come into class. As a final gesture to students, I post a chart that summarizes why they missed class and why others who had taken the class previously also missed. Categories include:\nWhat surprised me was how reasons for missing class at Iowa State in 2012 were so similar to reasons at Ohio in 1992-2003. The world has changed so much since then, especially in the digital classroom. Nobody missed class because of Facebook, for instance. In fact, the only technology-related absence concerned a student missing class from Oct. 29 through Nov. 2 to attend a Microsoft conference in Seattle. Also consider this: Stringent attendance policies may be necessary in small workshops, labs or other group-related classes. I get that. I also know we’re very good at finding reasons why students should attend our classes but usually not very informed about why they actually skip. In the end, it’s their tuition dollar and their grade. As I explained to my class, my attendance policy may look lenient at first blush, but I also can document that students with the fewest absences also almost always boast the highest grades. There is a correlation there, and I have the data to prove it.

I employ a 24\/7 policy in resolving such questions. Please set up an appointment to speak with me at least 24 hours after and no more than one week after your grade has been issued. Be aware that the 24\/7 period begins when I hand back the assignment, regardless of whether you are present in class that day to pick it up.

Students are expected to attend every meeting (unless you have an excused absence). As noted above, your active, thoughtful and informed participation is worth 15% of your final grade. Successful participation in the course will require considerable time, thought, and energy both during class and in outside preparation. Each student will be expected to make an active, informed, thoughtful contribution to each session. You will need to demonstrate that you have read the assigned readings completely, with a sufficient level of engagement to help further discussion. This does not mean just summarizing the point of the reading to demonstrate basic understanding; you should use your understanding of the reading as a starting point, proceeding to make an inference of your own, to agree or disagree, or to bring up a relevant point or example that pushes the discussion forward. Show that you are listening carefully and thoughtfully to the contributions of your classmates, and incorporate their thoughts into your own response whenever possible. In class discussions, weekly reading responses, and peer workshops, your comments should further the conversation, advance or clarify your point of view, or encourage others to respond. Rather than each student making statements directed at the instructor, our discussions should involve a web of interactions amongst peers; the conversation will be more interesting and more fruitful if it involves every member of the class. Excused Absences and Late Work: According to University policy, absences from class are excused in the following circumstances:\nIllness or injury. Mandatory religious obligations – must be documented and arranged in advance. Authorized University activities – must be documented and arranged in advance. If you have a conscientious objection to course material covered that day, you may chose not to come, and may be asked to complete an alternate assignment or activity. See UI Operations Manual III.15.2f). Must be arranged in advance: I always give warning for content or activities that might fall under this category. Late work is acceptable only by arrangement with me, and it may not always be logistically possible for you to make up a public oral presentation even if an absence is excused. I will try to accommodate you but if class is unable to accommodate an audience for your speech, you may not be able to meet the requirement for public presentation of the speech. Work missed during excused absences (those caused by documented illnesses, family emergencies, religious obligations, or authorized University activities) can be made up; if possible, contact me in advance to make arrangements regarding such absences. In all cases, I require documentation. I may ask you to complete the Registrar's “Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class” form, which is available at http:\/\/www.registrar.uiowa.edu\/Student\/Forms forStudents\/tabid79\/Default.aspx.

Considering Self-Representation? It Is Difficult to Navigate the Judicial System but Online Information Is Available\nAs a layperson, it is very difficult to navigate the judicial system. However, people will research online and learn that it’s probably an easy thing for them to do themselves. Considering the Consequences of a DWI Conviction or a Denial into the Alcohol Education Program, Is Self-Representation Really the Best Option? Interviewer: But it is safe to say it would be a lot easier and the outcome would be more certain if you had an attorney at your side instead of representing yourself. Jack O’Donnell: That’s right. This is because no two judges are the same as far as granting admittance into these programs. This is why it’s just prudent to have an experienced attorney who can advise you on all aspects of the program and evaluate whether or not you should even be applying for the program. Does Your DWI Case Have Valid Defensible Issues? It Is Possible That the Alcohol Education Program Isn’t the Best Option\nFor example, maybe there are some defensible issues in this particular case and you make the prosecutor take a long, hard look at it. Then, the alcohol program would be a fallback position as opposed to your go-to option. Interviewer: If the alcohol education program is not an option, what are the possible penalties someone will face for a first time DUI? First-Time DWI Offenders May Face a Six Month Jail Sentence; More Likely the Penalties Will Comprise Fines, Probation and a License Suspension\nJack O’Donnell: The possible penalty is six months in jail. However, you are not likely to be sentenced six months in jail unless something really egregious transpired. Your license will be suspended and then you’d be placed on probation for 18 months. There’d be a $500 fine, probation costs of $200 and court costs would get you up to almost $795. First-Time Offenders May Be Eligible for a Permit to Drive to and from Their Place of Employment\nConnecticut still may issue a work permit that enables driving to and from work. However, that’s only for our first-timer offenders who are subject to the 90-day license suspension. The work permit serves as a partial driving privilege restoration for those 90 days. Driver’s with License Suspensions for Twelve Months Will Be Required to Install an Ignition Interlock Device in Order to Drive within That Year\nIf you lost your license for 120 days, you can get the work permit for 120 days, but if you lost it for a year, you had no ability to go to work. They now order the installation of an ignition interlock device, which is now available to people after 45 days. However, in that case, you are still without a license for 45 days.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6f798bd2-9071-4289-a475-ecbbdbf737b1>"]}]}

These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages\n\nWhen needs exceed local, tribal, and State resources, the Governor may request Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. While the Stafford Act may be the most familiar mechanism for Federal support, it is not the only one. Often, Federal assistance does not require coordination by the Department of Homeland Security and can be provided without a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. In these instances, Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to States, as well as directly to tribes and local jurisdictions, consistent with their own authorities. One of the tenets of professionalism in emergency management is the pursuit of continuous improvement. After the incident response winds down, resources are demobilized, and the EOC is deactivated, the emergency manager’s job is not finished. To complete the cycle of continuous improvement, it is important to conduct an after-action review to evaluate how well the policies and procedures outlined in the EOP worked, and how well prepared the jurisdiction was to conduct an effective response. This process should produce an after-action report and improvement plan with a timetable for carrying out any needed changes. Continue Your Learning: Next Steps\nBelow are some steps you can take to begin learning how your jurisdiction manages response operations. - Learn about your jurisdiction’s EOC. - Where is it located? - How is it organized? - What systems have been established for joint sharing of information? - What kinds of incident management systems are used? (For example, is there an electronic incident management system that provides for easy sharing of information?) - Learn about your jurisdiction’s response history. - What emergencies have been declared? - How often has the EOC been activated, and at what levels? - Review after-action reports and improvement plans. Were improvements recommended? Have improvement plans been implemented?

FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) Courses:\n- IS-100: Introduction to the Incident Command System (ICS)\n- IS-701: NIMS Multiagency Coordination Systems\n- IS-703: NIMS Resource Management\n- IS-775: EOC Management and Operations\nThis lesson discussed the emergency manager’s role in responding to an emergency, including:\n- Key roles and responsibilities of an emergency manager in emergency response. - Functions of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC). - Alternative ways an EOC can be organized. - Significance of coordinating information during incident response. - Role of the EOC in resource management during incident response. Lesson 7: Recovering From Emergencies\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in recovering from an emergency. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Identify core principles for recovery. - Describe the purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Identify typical disaster recovery operations. - Indicate the purpose of the Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Recovering From Emergencies\nThe capabilities required to recover from emergencies focus on restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of infrastructure; housing; sustainable economy; and the health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of the community. Recovery operations may range from damage assessment and building inspection to restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure. Recovery may include activities as diverse as care for survivors, community redevelopment, and support for business recovery. And recovery always requires documentation of disaster operations and costs. Recovery is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. All of these resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish an effective short- and long-term recovery. As an emergency manager, your role in the recovery process involves planning, managing, and coordinating the recovery effort. This lesson will introduce you to your recovery responsibilities and some of the resources available to you. The term recovery refers to those capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident in recovering effectively. It is focused on a timely restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of:\n- Sustainable economy. - Health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.\n\n- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event. Continue Your Learning: Next Steps\nBelow are some steps you can take to begin learning how your jurisdiction manages disaster recovery. - Find out what recovery policies, plans, and procedures your jurisdiction has in place. - What predisaster recovery plans have been developed (e.g., debris management plan, continuity of government plan, continuity of operations plan, other recovery plans)? - Is the emergency manager’s role specified in those plans? - When were the plans last updated? - What provisions have been made for setting up Disaster Recovery Centers when needed? - Learn about your jurisdiction’s recovery history. - Has your jurisdiction experienced disasters for which recovery plans were implemented? - What strategies were used to facilitate physical, economic, and emotional recovery of the community? Continue Your Learning: Additional Resources\nBelow are links to resources you can use to learn more about recovering from emergencies. FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) Courses:\n- IS-403: Introduction to Individual Assistance (IA)\n- IS-546: Continuity of Operations Awareness Course (introduces continuity planning)\n- IS-547: Introduction to Continuity of Operations\n- IS-559: Local Damage Assessment\n- IS-632: Introduction to Debris Operations\n- IS-634: Introduction to FEMA’s Public Assistance Program\nThis lesson discussed your role in recovering from an emergency, including:\n- Key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Core principles for recovery. - Purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Typical disaster recovery operations. - The Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Lesson 8: Administering Your Program\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in administering the emergency management program. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify typical administrative responsibilities of an emergency manager. - Describe staffing options for routine and emergency operations. - Identify items typically included in an emergency management budget. - Describe the importance of documentation in emergency management. - Indicate the characteristics of an effective records management system. - Explain the impact of privacy laws on recordkeeping. - Identify strategies to ensure information security. The Emergency Manager As Administrator\nThe administrative functions of daily operations affect the community’s ability to respond effectively during emergencies. Four important administrative functions are carried out on a daily basis and during emergencies:\n- Budgeting and Accounting\n- Records Management\n- Information Security\nEmergency Management Programs: No Single Model\nStaffing requirements and resources vary from one community to the next. A large city or county may have a full-time emergency manager with a paid supporting staff. There also may be a full-time fire and police department.\n\n|← Modern Family and Marriage||Questions Answers →|\nThe guidance presented by the National Preparedness Goal creates the key for the success of emergency management. The guidance that seeks to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover is independent and requires the emergency department to employ the current preparedness networks, upgrade training programs, and ensure high capabilities of financial, administrative, and logistics systems. In addition, the above-presented goals provide the community and individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge that are aimed at enabling the entire community to benefit from the preparedness for natural disasters. Greater preparedness for contingencies reduces the probability of risks the nation might face and increases the level of sustainability. Consequently, as soon as the emergency department develops the core capabilities, it can be more prepared for various challenges. What is more important is that these capabilities will allow emergency managers to fill the existing gaps and define the targets for measuring and developing new approaches to coping with the natural contingencies. The existence of the core capabilities is important because they allow distributing the responsibilities among department managers. For instance, prevention mechanism deals with such spheres as intelligence and information exchange, forensics and attribution, detection, screening and search. Other capabilities refer to different areas for which emergency department holds responsibility. In my opinion, the emergency management makes everything possible to build, sustain, and develop the capabilities for strengthening community resources and advancing individuals’ capabilities. Personnel and equipment should be enhanced to ensure proper quality of plan implementation. Additionally, the national preparedness system focuses on the overall collaborative level of the community and individual perception of the critical responsibilities and tasks. It also ensures that the community is ready to react to natural disasters or man-made contingencies. However, there are still points that need to be discussed. This is of particular concern to the personnel department that should be constantly trained and developed to ensure the proper level of protection. \"This web helped me with writing my essay.

He knows first-hand the challenges that come with sustaining a preparedness and response knowledge base, especially during times of budgets cuts and staff reductions. “Many of the public health pioneers that established current programs have moved on to new endeavors or retired and took critical knowledge and skills with them.”\nMcHargue is responsible for implementing Health and Medical preparedness capabilities during emergencies and coordinating the ESF8 (Health and Medical) support activities within the established emergency response systems with local, state, and federal partners. “At the State ESF 8 level, we provide planning, training, and exercise support to train and develop current and future practitioners and leaders for local County Health Departments and the Department of Health,” he says. Mentees who are looking to gain employment in preparedness and response positions should have a range of capabilities – from public health knowledge and clinical skills to emergency management experience. Of course, formal training in Basic National Incident Management System (NIMS) for ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 are required pre-requisites. McHargue believes that a combination of these skills among their total staff is vital to effective preparedness and response planning and implementation. “We also seek out [professionals] who are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances, are available to work altered work schedules, are available to deploy to the field, and demonstrate their ability to collaborate with diverse groups for planning and response activities,” he says.

In reality, emergency management is not just about the core functions involved in response. It includes a broad array of program functions, and much of the work is of a nonemergency nature. Core functions are those that are critical to a successful emergency response. Emergency managers are responsible for the following core functions:\n- Direction, control, and coordination\n- External affairs\/Emergency public information\n- Population protection\n- Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services\n- Public health and medical services\n- Logistics management and resource support\nIn addition to the emergency core functions, the emergency manager directs the day-to-day emergency management program that enables the jurisdiction to build and sustain needed capabilities and maintain a state of preparedness. Examples of nonemergency program activities include:\n- Ongoing monitoring of threat\/hazard information. - Developing and updating plans. - Recruiting and training staff. - Planning and coordinating exercises. - Budgeting, accounting, and grant writing. - Building relationships across the community. - Educating the public. - Organizing for hazard mitigation. - Soliciting public input on recovery planning. - Documenting, reporting, and managing information. A key role that runs through core functions and emergency functions alike is that of coordinating information—keeping the community, stakeholders, and officials informed. Information empowers community members to make informed choices that affect their health and well-being. And when incidents occur, information enables stakeholders to manage the situation effectively. Keeping the Public Informed\nRegardless of who delivers information to the public—the emergency manager, a public information officer, or other spokesperson—you are responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to keep the public informed and warned. The system must be able to reach all segments of the population, and the information they receive must be:\n- Simple and clear. - Focused on the immediate needs. - Helpful for building confidence in the response. Underlying all the other qualities, functions, and activities of an emergency manager is an expectation of ethical conduct. As an emergency management professional, you represent your organization and your profession. Your actions must instill trust and confidence in those with whom you work and in those who depend on you for assistance. In an emergency, the community and your partners must be able to count on you to carry out your responsibilities in a professional and fair manner. The SELF Test\nAsk yourself . . . Do my decisions withstand . . . Do my decisions . . . Do my decisions show . . . Are my decisions . . . Typical Emergency Manager Responsibilities\nNow that you have a general picture of the broad roles of the emergency manager, let’s take a closer look at what these roles mean in terms of specific responsibilities. Typical emergency manager tasks can be arranged by incident phase:\n- Determine overall capabilities. - Plan for emergencies that may arise and keep the emergency operations plan (EOP) up to date. - Provide support and advice to elected officials in establishing and carrying out policy. - Educate the public. - Plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate training and exercises. - Identify resource needs and sources of resources. Incident Response Responsibilities:\n- Establish and maintain a common understanding of the situation. - Coordinate with other agencies, jurisdictions, and levels of government on resource allocation, communications and information management, and public information. - Advise elected and appointed officials on policy. - Provide off-site support to the Incident Command (typically a small part of the emergency manager’s role). Post-Incident and Recovery Responsibilities:\n- Initiate damage assessments. - Coordinate with agencies providing food and shelter. - Coordinate with agencies to restore essential services (power, roads, etc.). - Conduct the after-action evaluation and develop an improvement plan. - Determine how emergency management and response can be better integrated. - Fully document incident activities and related costs. - Ensure that all bills are paid. - Replenish supplies. - Initiate long-term recovery plans. - Implement mitigation plans. - Oversee long-term recovery efforts.\n\n- Postdisaster planning is a discrete process for the disaster at hand that results in integrated recovery and reconstruction programs, actions, and recovery. Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.\n\nRecovery is a sequence of interdependent and often concurrent activities that advance a community toward a successful recovery. Disaster recovery is based on the following core principles:\n|Individual and Family Empowerment||Individuals and households are encouraged to engage in their own recovery.|\n|Leadership and Local Primacy||It is important to remember that all disasters are local; therefore, local governments must be partners in all recovery actions taken on their behalf.|\n|Predisaster Recovery Planning||Individuals, households, and local governments can enhance their recovery from disaster by taking preparedness measures such as developing a predisaster recovery plan, using disaster-resistant building practices, and participating in or conducting training and exercise programs.|\n|Partnerships and Inclusiveness||Successful recovery involves the support and involvement of all stakeholders within the community and with outside entities that are assisting in recovery operations.|\n|Public Information||The public must be kept informed of the status of recovery operations if they are to support and participate in recovery activities.|\n|Unity of Effort||The combined efforts of all stakeholders will help achieve an effective recovery.|\n|Timeliness and Flexibility||There is no established timeframe for recovery to be accomplished. It depends on the makeup of the community, the nature and complexity of the incident, and the combined efforts of all stakeholders.|\n|Resilience and Sustainability||Successful recovery incorporates mitigation actions and best practices to help ensure the future viability of the community. It also involves the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.|\n|Psychological and Emotional Recovery||Disaster recovery isn’t just about restoring places and things. It also involves actions to help individuals and households cope with stress, illness, and uncertainty resulting from the disaster.|\nFactors in a Successful Recovery\nExperience shows that the following factors in a community can help ensure a successful recovery:\n- Effective decisionmaking and coordination\n- Integration of community recovery planning processes\n- Well-managed recovery\n- Proactive community engagement, public participation, and public awareness\n- Well-administered financial acquisition\n- Organizational flexibility\n- Resilient rebuilding\nRecovery—like other facets of emergency management—is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Emergency Manager’s Recovery Role\nThe local government has the primary role of planning and managing all aspects of the community’s recovery. Individuals, families, and businesses look to local governments to articulate their recovery needs. Although community leaders are ultimately responsible for the recovery of their community, they rely on the emergency management team in general—and the emergency manager specifically—to manage and coordinate the disaster recovery effort. Recovery Task Force\nSome jurisdictions establish a local Recovery Task Force—often led by the emergency manager—to guide the community through recovery. If a Recovery Task Force has not been created by a community, the responsibility for managing and coordinating recovery resources and activities is still often accomplished by the emergency manager. In this capacity, you will not be directing or controlling the resources of other members of the emergency management team; rather, you will be coordinating those resources to help ensure their efficient use. Potential Members of a Recovery Task Force\n- Elected\/Appointed officials\n- Public information officer\n- Emergency management\n- Public safety department\n- Public works department\n- Building department\n- Finance department\n- Planning\/community development department\n- Community services\n- Health care (hospitals and public health)\n- Chamber of commerce\n- Business community\n- Voluntary agencies\n- School districts\n- Neighborhood\/Citizens groups\nBoth predisaster and postdisaster recovery planning are critical for communities to develop resilience and for successful and timely recovery. - Predisaster recovery planning identifies activities, priorities, and roles and responsibilities required for the community to recover from disaster. Predisaster recovery plans should include a continuity of government (COG) and continuity of operations (COOP) plan.\n\nEducation and Preparedness (12)||-Provide: drill\/audit\/talk||√||√||√||√|\n|-Knowledge and skill in different disaster situations||√||√||√|\n|-Understand role in disaster assignment||√||√|\n|-Basic life support, CPR skills||√|\n|-Updating information about new diseases||√|\n|-Training in IT and communication skills||√|\n|-Skills in psychological intervention||√|\n|-Understanding of the nature of disasters||√|\n|6.

Join today tomorrow's leaders!","passages":[{"passage":"3 Key Competencies of Emergency and Asset Management Programs\nWe’ve seen a meteoric rise in the number of disaster and emergency management degree programs. These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:900654d3-ef19-443d-b60c-ebd7c3b7688a>"]},{"passage":"When needs exceed local, tribal, and State resources, the Governor may request Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. While the Stafford Act may be the most familiar mechanism for Federal support, it is not the only one. Often, Federal assistance does not require coordination by the Department of Homeland Security and can be provided without a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. In these instances, Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to States, as well as directly to tribes and local jurisdictions, consistent with their own authorities. One of the tenets of professionalism in emergency management is the pursuit of continuous improvement. After the incident response winds down, resources are demobilized, and the EOC is deactivated, the emergency manager’s job is not finished. To complete the cycle of continuous improvement, it is important to conduct an after-action review to evaluate how well the policies and procedures outlined in the EOP worked, and how well prepared the jurisdiction was to conduct an effective response. This process should produce an after-action report and improvement plan with a timetable for carrying out any needed changes.

Lesson 7: Recovering From Emergencies\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in recovering from an emergency. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Identify core principles for recovery. - Describe the purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Identify typical disaster recovery operations. - Indicate the purpose of the Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Recovering From Emergencies\nThe capabilities required to recover from emergencies focus on restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of infrastructure; housing; sustainable economy; and the health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of the community. Recovery operations may range from damage assessment and building inspection to restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure. Recovery may include activities as diverse as care for survivors, community redevelopment, and support for business recovery. And recovery always requires documentation of disaster operations and costs. Recovery is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. All of these resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish an effective short- and long-term recovery. As an emergency manager, your role in the recovery process involves planning, managing, and coordinating the recovery effort. This lesson will introduce you to your recovery responsibilities and some of the resources available to you. The term recovery refers to those capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident in recovering effectively. It is focused on a timely restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of:\n- Sustainable economy. - Health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event.

The guidance that seeks to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover is independent and requires the emergency department to employ the current preparedness networks, upgrade training programs, and ensure high capabilities of financial, administrative, and logistics systems. In addition, the above-presented goals provide the community and individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge that are aimed at enabling the entire community to benefit from the preparedness for natural disasters. Greater preparedness for contingencies reduces the probability of risks the nation might face and increases the level of sustainability. Consequently, as soon as the emergency department develops the core capabilities, it can be more prepared for various challenges. What is more important is that these capabilities will allow emergency managers to fill the existing gaps and define the targets for measuring and developing new approaches to coping with the natural contingencies. The existence of the core capabilities is important because they allow distributing the responsibilities among department managers. For instance, prevention mechanism deals with such spheres as intelligence and information exchange, forensics and attribution, detection, screening and search. Other capabilities refer to different areas for which emergency department holds responsibility. In my opinion, the emergency management makes everything possible to build, sustain, and develop the capabilities for strengthening community resources and advancing individuals’ capabilities. Personnel and equipment should be enhanced to ensure proper quality of plan implementation. Additionally, the national preparedness system focuses on the overall collaborative level of the community and individual perception of the critical responsibilities and tasks. It also ensures that the community is ready to react to natural disasters or man-made contingencies. However, there are still points that need to be discussed. This is of particular concern to the personnel department that should be constantly trained and developed to ensure the proper level of protection. \"This web helped me with writing my essay.

He knows first-hand the challenges that come with sustaining a preparedness and response knowledge base, especially during times of budgets cuts and staff reductions. “Many of the public health pioneers that established current programs have moved on to new endeavors or retired and took critical knowledge and skills with them.”\nMcHargue is responsible for implementing Health and Medical preparedness capabilities during emergencies and coordinating the ESF8 (Health and Medical) support activities within the established emergency response systems with local, state, and federal partners. “At the State ESF 8 level, we provide planning, training, and exercise support to train and develop current and future practitioners and leaders for local County Health Departments and the Department of Health,” he says. Mentees who are looking to gain employment in preparedness and response positions should have a range of capabilities – from public health knowledge and clinical skills to emergency management experience. Of course, formal training in Basic National Incident Management System (NIMS) for ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 are required pre-requisites. McHargue believes that a combination of these skills among their total staff is vital to effective preparedness and response planning and implementation. “We also seek out [professionals] who are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances, are available to work altered work schedules, are available to deploy to the field, and demonstrate their ability to collaborate with diverse groups for planning and response activities,” he says.

In reality, emergency management is not just about the core functions involved in response. It includes a broad array of program functions, and much of the work is of a nonemergency nature. Core functions are those that are critical to a successful emergency response. Emergency managers are responsible for the following core functions:\n- Direction, control, and coordination\n- External affairs\/Emergency public information\n- Population protection\n- Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services\n- Public health and medical services\n- Logistics management and resource support\nIn addition to the emergency core functions, the emergency manager directs the day-to-day emergency management program that enables the jurisdiction to build and sustain needed capabilities and maintain a state of preparedness. Examples of nonemergency program activities include:\n- Ongoing monitoring of threat\/hazard information. - Developing and updating plans. - Recruiting and training staff. - Planning and coordinating exercises. - Budgeting, accounting, and grant writing. - Building relationships across the community. - Educating the public. - Organizing for hazard mitigation. - Soliciting public input on recovery planning. - Documenting, reporting, and managing information. A key role that runs through core functions and emergency functions alike is that of coordinating information—keeping the community, stakeholders, and officials informed. Information empowers community members to make informed choices that affect their health and well-being. And when incidents occur, information enables stakeholders to manage the situation effectively. Keeping the Public Informed\nRegardless of who delivers information to the public—the emergency manager, a public information officer, or other spokesperson—you are responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to keep the public informed and warned. The system must be able to reach all segments of the population, and the information they receive must be:\n- Simple and clear. - Focused on the immediate needs. - Helpful for building confidence in the response. Underlying all the other qualities, functions, and activities of an emergency manager is an expectation of ethical conduct. As an emergency management professional, you represent your organization and your profession. Your actions must instill trust and confidence in those with whom you work and in those who depend on you for assistance. In an emergency, the community and your partners must be able to count on you to carry out your responsibilities in a professional and fair manner. The SELF Test\nAsk yourself . . . Do my decisions withstand . . . Do my decisions . . . Do my decisions show . . . Are my decisions . . . Typical Emergency Manager Responsibilities\nNow that you have a general picture of the broad roles of the emergency manager, let’s take a closer look at what these roles mean in terms of specific responsibilities. Typical emergency manager tasks can be arranged by incident phase:\n- Determine overall capabilities. - Plan for emergencies that may arise and keep the emergency operations plan (EOP) up to date. - Provide support and advice to elected officials in establishing and carrying out policy. - Educate the public. - Plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate training and exercises. - Identify resource needs and sources of resources. Incident Response Responsibilities:\n- Establish and maintain a common understanding of the situation. - Coordinate with other agencies, jurisdictions, and levels of government on resource allocation, communications and information management, and public information. - Advise elected and appointed officials on policy. - Provide off-site support to the Incident Command (typically a small part of the emergency manager’s role). Post-Incident and Recovery Responsibilities:\n- Initiate damage assessments. - Coordinate with agencies providing food and shelter. - Coordinate with agencies to restore essential services (power, roads, etc.). - Conduct the after-action evaluation and develop an improvement plan. - Determine how emergency management and response can be better integrated. - Fully document incident activities and related costs. - Ensure that all bills are paid. - Replenish supplies. - Initiate long-term recovery plans. - Implement mitigation plans. - Oversee long-term recovery efforts.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"- Postdisaster planning is a discrete process for the disaster at hand that results in integrated recovery and reconstruction programs, actions, and recovery. Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"Recovery is a sequence of interdependent and often concurrent activities that advance a community toward a successful recovery. Disaster recovery is based on the following core principles:\n|Individual and Family Empowerment||Individuals and households are encouraged to engage in their own recovery.|\n|Leadership and Local Primacy||It is important to remember that all disasters are local; therefore, local governments must be partners in all recovery actions taken on their behalf.|\n|Predisaster Recovery Planning||Individuals, households, and local governments can enhance their recovery from disaster by taking preparedness measures such as developing a predisaster recovery plan, using disaster-resistant building practices, and participating in or conducting training and exercise programs.|\n|Partnerships and Inclusiveness||Successful recovery involves the support and involvement of all stakeholders within the community and with outside entities that are assisting in recovery operations.|\n|Public Information||The public must be kept informed of the status of recovery operations if they are to support and participate in recovery activities.|\n|Unity of Effort||The combined efforts of all stakeholders will help achieve an effective recovery.|\n|Timeliness and Flexibility||There is no established timeframe for recovery to be accomplished. It depends on the makeup of the community, the nature and complexity of the incident, and the combined efforts of all stakeholders.|\n|Resilience and Sustainability||Successful recovery incorporates mitigation actions and best practices to help ensure the future viability of the community. It also involves the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.|\n|Psychological and Emotional Recovery||Disaster recovery isn’t just about restoring places and things. It also involves actions to help individuals and households cope with stress, illness, and uncertainty resulting from the disaster.|\nFactors in a Successful Recovery\nExperience shows that the following factors in a community can help ensure a successful recovery:\n- Effective decisionmaking and coordination\n- Integration of community recovery planning processes\n- Well-managed recovery\n- Proactive community engagement, public participation, and public awareness\n- Well-administered financial acquisition\n- Organizational flexibility\n- Resilient rebuilding\nRecovery—like other facets of emergency management—is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government.

Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Emergency Manager’s Recovery Role\nThe local government has the primary role of planning and managing all aspects of the community’s recovery. Individuals, families, and businesses look to local governments to articulate their recovery needs. Although community leaders are ultimately responsible for the recovery of their community, they rely on the emergency management team in general—and the emergency manager specifically—to manage and coordinate the disaster recovery effort. Recovery Task Force\nSome jurisdictions establish a local Recovery Task Force—often led by the emergency manager—to guide the community through recovery. If a Recovery Task Force has not been created by a community, the responsibility for managing and coordinating recovery resources and activities is still often accomplished by the emergency manager. In this capacity, you will not be directing or controlling the resources of other members of the emergency management team; rather, you will be coordinating those resources to help ensure their efficient use. Potential Members of a Recovery Task Force\n- Elected\/Appointed officials\n- Public information officer\n- Emergency management\n- Public safety department\n- Public works department\n- Building department\n- Finance department\n- Planning\/community development department\n- Community services\n- Health care (hospitals and public health)\n- Chamber of commerce\n- Business community\n- Voluntary agencies\n- School districts\n- Neighborhood\/Citizens groups\nBoth predisaster and postdisaster recovery planning are critical for communities to develop resilience and for successful and timely recovery. - Predisaster recovery planning identifies activities, priorities, and roles and responsibilities required for the community to recover from disaster.

In all, 4.4 million people require medical attention each year as a result of a road accident. it goes without saying that the more safety features a vehicle has, the better chance you and your passengers have against injury in the event of a crash. With modern advances in technology, driving has become much safer. Keep reading to find out three new car safety features that should be essential for your next vehicle. 1. AEB: Automatic Emergency Braking\nAEB or Automatic Emergency Braking has become more sought after in recent years, as modern advances happen in the automotive industry. A vehicle that has AEB fitted will automatically sense a potential collision, and if the driver does not react in time, the car will do the braking on your behalf. A driver will find that in the event of a collision, the car will be able to commence braking before the driver has even had time to react, drastically reducing the severity of the collision itself. 2. The Rear-View Camera\nThere are two main benefits to having a rear-view camera on your car:\n- The driver gets a clear view of anything that is behind the vehicle while reversing\n- The rear-view camera can detect objects, people, or animals that are too short to be seen over the backend of the car\nThese rear-view cameras usually have a 180-degree backward view, so a driver will be able to see on the screen any obstructions behind them. 3. Futuristic Facial Recognition\nVery recently, some car manufacturers have revealed vehicles that have facial recognition software installed. What does this mean? Well, the facial recognition software has the ability to constantly measure the driver’s alertness, as well as give warnings when it feels that the driver isn’t paying enough attention. The warning comes in the form of a buzzer with the objective of bringing the driver’s attention back to the wheel. Bonus New Car Safety Features\nCar safety features come in the form of many vehicle advancements, particularly in recent years. Some of these we feel are worthy of a special mention:\n- Smart headlights have the ability to lower the level of the light beam when it senses oncoming traffic, so other drivers aren’t ‘blinded’\n- Night vision features are also available that will serve as a warning system for pedestrians and cyclists that aren’t easily seen at night\nIf you do find yourself in the difficult position of having recently had a road collision, make sure you’re up to scratch with the requirements and things that need to be done. Sweet Law is an organization that can assist with this. Shopping For New Car Safety Features\nWhen you’re in the market for a new vehicle, new car safety features should be top of the list of what you need to look at. You can also look for things like forward-collision warning systems, shatter-resistant glass, and airbags, all of which are dated technology, but coupled with new advancements can make your new vehicle as safe as possible.

Product Reviews.\n\nCar safety has improved in leaps and bounds over the past few decades. Take a look at some of the ways that your car keeps you safe in the event of a collision. When you get behind the wheel of your car, you’re effectively putting your life in the metaphorical hands of a machine. That’s why it’s so important that you choose a car that’s both safe and reliable. Although boring, practical features like airbags aren’t always top of mind when we draw up our wish list of features for a new car, they should be! Our cars have come a long way in terms of safety\nEarly car models didn’t come equipped with safety features like airbags and passive safety technology. Take a look at these crash test dummies taking a beating in safety tests during the 1950’s. Feeling nervous? Don’t panic, car safety has come a long way since our grandparents’ days. In the past, cars were built to survive a collision. Reinforced metal panels were designed to be as stiff as possible in an effort to avoid your car wrapping around a light pole like tin foil around last night’s leftovers. Little did they know…\nTurns out, you actually need your car to crumple up like that. This rigidity might make the panel beater's job a little easier - but it led to drivers and passengers being flung around like confetti, due to the kinetic force generated by the impact. Nowadays, the opposite is true. Thanks to modern technology, like crumple zones, we’re able to sacrifice your vehicle - allowing you to survive the collision instead. What on earth are crumple zones? In a nutshell, a crumple zone is a deliberately designed weak point on your vehicle, which is intended to buckle in a specific area upon impact. How does this protect the driver and their passengers? Well, crumple zones are cleverly engineered to absorb a large portion of the kinetic energy that results from a collision. Depending on the shape, size and manufacturer of your vehicle, these crumple zones can vary from simple segmented crumple zones, to using a variety of metals and intricate honeycomb designs (which are stiffer under normal conditions, but collapse easily in a crash). What other safety features do modern cars have to protect their drivers? Modern cars have various passive and active safety systems to keep you and your loved ones safe. Some cars are even smart enough to predict accidents, and alert the driver before a collision occurs. Did you know the Suzuki Vitara was first in its class to be awarded a five star safety rating from European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP)? The NCAP five star rating is reserved for cars which provide the greatest collision protection for both passengers and pedestrians. The NCAP tests put vehicles through rigorous testing, so every star is extremely valuable! When you’re weighing up the safety features in a vehicle, some of the top features to look out for are:\n- Airbags - at least one for both the driver and a passenger. - Anti-lock braking system (ABS) - which prevents your wheels from locking, and gives you the ability to steer during hard braking. - Electronic brake force distribution (EBD) - which automatically varies pressure applied to each wheel, depending on the road conditions, to allow maximum stopping power and control. - Adaptive headlights shine their beams in the direction of a curve, giving you better vision at night and in poor visibility, around bends in the road. - Central locking. - SIPS or Side Impact Protection System is the name of a system to protect against injury in a side collision. - Seat belts with pretensioners, To make sure a seatbelt restrains an occupant as early as possible in a crash. - As well as load limiters, to help protect occupants from seatbelt-inflicted injury. Your infotainment system won’t save your life - but those airbags sure could. Your life is precious, don’t forfeit safety in favour of the nice-to-haves. Is your child learning to drive? Or maybe they’ve just passed their driver’s test. Chances are they’re begging you for their own set of wheels. Download the ebook, Guide to buying your child their first car, to help you navigate the inevitable debate over reliability and the ever coveted “cool” factors.\n\nWhen it comes to today’s SUVs, cars, trucks, and minivans, electronic tech features are hugely important. These items are now an integral part of how you interact with your vehicle, as well as how your vehicle interacts with the cars around it on the road. They range from safety and security measures to communication and connectivity features. We’ve put together a list of the best automotive technologies to look for when buying a new car. Some of them serve as safety shields that you will hopefully never need to use, but you can take comfort knowing they’re there. Others assist with parking and visibility. And some of this tech helps you stay connected to friends and family, or quickly contact emergency services. When you shop for a vehicle with these features, the ideal ones make things easier without causing driver distraction. Here is our list of the best automotive technologies of 2022. 1. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nThis is a category of systems that can ensure that you know when a vehicle is in your blind spot, can keep you a safe distance from the car in front of you, and can keep your vehicle from drifting into another lane. One of the first examples of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) was anti-lock brakes. These are now standard equipment on every new car. In modern vehicles, there are now dozens of these systems. These advanced driver assist systems often come in bundled safety suites. Some examples are Toyota\nSafety Sense, Subaru\nEyeSight, Ford CoPilot360, Honda\nSensing, and Nissan\nSafety Shield 360. Even if a model you are shopping for doesn’t have ADAS as a bundle or suite of features, many automakers sell them as standalone options or include them as part of a specific trim level. Key features to look for\nAdaptive cruise control\nIn some ways, adaptive control is similar to regular cruise control. However, while adaptive cruise control also keeps your vehicle at a set speed, additionally it slows down or accelerates to keep a safe distance from the car in front of you. This uses sensors on the vehicle to detect if there is a vehicle in your blind spot. It signals that there’s a vehicle there with an alert on your side mirrors. Some pickup trucks also have a blind-spot alert that takes into account vehicles that are next to either side of your trailer while you tow. If you are trying to back out of a parking space and you can’t see around the vehicles on either side, rear cross-traffic alert will let you know if a vehicle is approaching. This system often uses radar units on the vehicle to detect cross traffic. In some cases, you’ll hear an alert and see arrows on the center screen that show from which direction the other car is coming. Front cross-traffic alert is especially handy when you’re exiting a blind alley or driveway. Some newer systems also prevent you from turning left across traffic if it senses a vehicle is in your path. Forward collision warning\/avoidance\nForward collision warning (FCW) senses if you are at risk of a potential collision with the vehicle ahead of you. Some systems can sense if there is a pending collision a few vehicles ahead. FCW can make sounds, flash display lights, or provide a tactile change to the way the steering wheel or brake pedal feels. Forward collision avoidance uses the FCW sensors and, if the driver doesn’t react quickly enough, adds automatic emergency braking to stop the vehicle. This feature will alert you if your vehicle starts drifting into another lane. If your vehicle does start to drift into another lane, lane-keep assist uses steering to keep your car in the lane. If your vehicle drifts into oncoming traffic, some systems will also use steering to get back onto the correct side of the road. Reverse brake assist\nIf this system senses an object behind your vehicle while backing up, reverse brake assist can use automatic emergency braking to stop your car, avoiding a collision. 2. Automatic emergency braking\nAs you can see from the examples above, automatic emergency braking is an essential part of safety tech. When the car senses that a collision is imminent, AEB activates your car’s brakes, potentially avoiding or minimizing an accident. AEB can react faster than a person and can start working before you hit the brakes. If you are braking and it senses you need to stop sooner, AEB can also brake harder than the pressure you’re applying.","passages":[{"passage":"PPE keeps workers safe when performing the following assembly tasks:\n- Adjusting small parts and screws\n- Assembling bolts\n- Assembling chassis\n- Assembling components like dashboards, panels, and seats\n- Assembling electrical components and wire harnesses\n- Assembling finished products\n- Assembling parts\n- Attaching cables\n- Body trimming\n- Connecting devices\n- Connecting wire harnesses\n- Constructing finished products\n- Fastening components and parts\n- Feeling fine parts\n- Screwing, tightening, and clamping of parts\n- Installing electronics and wiring\n- Installing carpet, door pads, door mechanisms, and headliners\n- Loading components on the line\n- Moving heavy parts and items from bulk containers, racks, shelves, or in bins\n- Position components such as motors, gear boxes, drive trains in and on machine frame\n- Pushing carts and totes\n- Set up, fit, and bolt place large parts such as frames, brackets\n- Using a wide range of tools (This task is a major source of cut and puncture injuries, as identified in previous blogs.) Using Tools on an Assembly Line\nFor a full list of the work activities and tasks that assemblers perform, be sure to check out onetonline.org. It outlines the dangerous tasks that workers in this field face every day. This is why wearing the right PPE is so critical and why MCR Safety works hard to match the right PPE to the job. Potential Assembly Hazards\nMetal and cut hazards are abound in automotive assembly, which is why workers in this industry need to protect their hands and arms. Almost everywhere you look in automotive assembly, workers come into contact with metal. One nick against freshly welded metal can cause serious injury to a worker. Arm protection is a critical piece of PPE worn in automotive manufacturing. Beyond cut injuries, automotive manufacturing employees come in contact with many hazards. Every day these men and women work around lubricants, brake fluid, oil and grease; lifting heavy objects; touching and inspecting metal that may have sharp or jagged edges; welding sparks; flying objects; and a variety of other dangers. Our Automotive industry page provides deeper insight into the hazards workers in this industry face and what PPE products to consider. Finding the Right Glove for Assembly Work\nWorker accuracy and speed are two areas of high importance when assembling components. This means choosing the right glove is extremely important, as a worker can’t afford downtime or limited hand movement when screwing in bolts, nuts, or parts. Their takt time will suffer! When choosing the right assembly gloves for your needs, you definitely need to consider the cut protection offered and the dip:\n- Cut-Resistant Gloves\nYou want to pay attention to the cut-resistance properties of any PPE that you purchase, including gloves and sleeves. As previously mentioned, sharp metal is everywhere in automotive plants. Our Cut Protection page provides a tool to help you quickly find the right gloves based on specific cut scores. MCR Safety’s cut protection sorting tool. Click the image to start using! - Polyurethane-dipped Gloves\n80% of assemblers wear PU-dipped gloves.

There are numerous areas that cables have to be applied for things to work out as they should. At times, wires can get messy; they can leave things looking untidy and unkempt. When cables are not installed and managed the right way, the chances are that they may end up not functioning as they should. When you are in an industry that requires the use of numerous cables, you have to make sure that their installation and other services to them is done to the level best and with the right technology. Human is to error, and mostly, with such a manual duty of handling cables, there are chances that things might get faulty or lack a lasting installation touch. It is, therefore, best to work with a cable handling equipment, because then, you can be sure that things will work out in perfection and there is barely anything that will be left out unattended. Your work will also be more comfortable because the functionality of a machine can never be compared to human duty. There is wire handling equipment that is in the market today, and they are the best option for you when you want things to run better. You may come across various options that you can work with, but you have to make sure that you invest in the best. Get to know more about how you can go about the purchase of cable handling equipment with ease and get the best. The most important thing is making sure that you are getting the best equipment. There may be several types of equipment where all have different functionality when you are not sure of how each of the functions, it is best if you would get guidance towards understanding how they function. Identify your needs, and then go to the market with the essentials in mind. When you are trying to achieve your goal, you will most probably manage to get the right equipment. It is wise if you would also look into any future needs you may have with your cabling, and have the equipment you purchase to be capable of taking care of it all. You will have saved yourself another hassle in the future when you pick a machine that will accommodate expansions in the future. Secondly, verify the company that has produced the equipment you purchase. It is wise to get equipment from a known company.

In all, 4.4 million people require medical attention each year as a result of a road accident. it goes without saying that the more safety features a vehicle has, the better chance you and your passengers have against injury in the event of a crash. With modern advances in technology, driving has become much safer. Keep reading to find out three new car safety features that should be essential for your next vehicle. 1. AEB: Automatic Emergency Braking\nAEB or Automatic Emergency Braking has become more sought after in recent years, as modern advances happen in the automotive industry. A vehicle that has AEB fitted will automatically sense a potential collision, and if the driver does not react in time, the car will do the braking on your behalf. A driver will find that in the event of a collision, the car will be able to commence braking before the driver has even had time to react, drastically reducing the severity of the collision itself. 2. The Rear-View Camera\nThere are two main benefits to having a rear-view camera on your car:\n- The driver gets a clear view of anything that is behind the vehicle while reversing\n- The rear-view camera can detect objects, people, or animals that are too short to be seen over the backend of the car\nThese rear-view cameras usually have a 180-degree backward view, so a driver will be able to see on the screen any obstructions behind them. 3. Futuristic Facial Recognition\nVery recently, some car manufacturers have revealed vehicles that have facial recognition software installed. What does this mean? Well, the facial recognition software has the ability to constantly measure the driver’s alertness, as well as give warnings when it feels that the driver isn’t paying enough attention. The warning comes in the form of a buzzer with the objective of bringing the driver’s attention back to the wheel. Bonus New Car Safety Features\nCar safety features come in the form of many vehicle advancements, particularly in recent years. Some of these we feel are worthy of a special mention:\n- Smart headlights have the ability to lower the level of the light beam when it senses oncoming traffic, so other drivers aren’t ‘blinded’\n- Night vision features are also available that will serve as a warning system for pedestrians and cyclists that aren’t easily seen at night\nIf you do find yourself in the difficult position of having recently had a road collision, make sure you’re up to scratch with the requirements and things that need to be done. Sweet Law is an organization that can assist with this. Shopping For New Car Safety Features\nWhen you’re in the market for a new vehicle, new car safety features should be top of the list of what you need to look at. You can also look for things like forward-collision warning systems, shatter-resistant glass, and airbags, all of which are dated technology, but coupled with new advancements can make your new vehicle as safe as possible.

Take a look at some of the ways that your car keeps you safe in the event of a collision. When you get behind the wheel of your car, you’re effectively putting your life in the metaphorical hands of a machine. That’s why it’s so important that you choose a car that’s both safe and reliable. Although boring, practical features like airbags aren’t always top of mind when we draw up our wish list of features for a new car, they should be! Our cars have come a long way in terms of safety\nEarly car models didn’t come equipped with safety features like airbags and passive safety technology. Take a look at these crash test dummies taking a beating in safety tests during the 1950’s. Feeling nervous? Don’t panic, car safety has come a long way since our grandparents’ days. In the past, cars were built to survive a collision. Reinforced metal panels were designed to be as stiff as possible in an effort to avoid your car wrapping around a light pole like tin foil around last night’s leftovers. Little did they know…\nTurns out, you actually need your car to crumple up like that. This rigidity might make the panel beater's job a little easier - but it led to drivers and passengers being flung around like confetti, due to the kinetic force generated by the impact. Nowadays, the opposite is true. Thanks to modern technology, like crumple zones, we’re able to sacrifice your vehicle - allowing you to survive the collision instead. What on earth are crumple zones? In a nutshell, a crumple zone is a deliberately designed weak point on your vehicle, which is intended to buckle in a specific area upon impact. How does this protect the driver and their passengers? Well, crumple zones are cleverly engineered to absorb a large portion of the kinetic energy that results from a collision. Depending on the shape, size and manufacturer of your vehicle, these crumple zones can vary from simple segmented crumple zones, to using a variety of metals and intricate honeycomb designs (which are stiffer under normal conditions, but collapse easily in a crash). What other safety features do modern cars have to protect their drivers? Modern cars have various passive and active safety systems to keep you and your loved ones safe. Some cars are even smart enough to predict accidents, and alert the driver before a collision occurs. Did you know the Suzuki Vitara was first in its class to be awarded a five star safety rating from European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP)? The NCAP five star rating is reserved for cars which provide the greatest collision protection for both passengers and pedestrians. The NCAP tests put vehicles through rigorous testing, so every star is extremely valuable! When you’re weighing up the safety features in a vehicle, some of the top features to look out for are:\n- Airbags - at least one for both the driver and a passenger. - Anti-lock braking system (ABS) - which prevents your wheels from locking, and gives you the ability to steer during hard braking. - Electronic brake force distribution (EBD) - which automatically varies pressure applied to each wheel, depending on the road conditions, to allow maximum stopping power and control. - Adaptive headlights shine their beams in the direction of a curve, giving you better vision at night and in poor visibility, around bends in the road. - Central locking. - SIPS or Side Impact Protection System is the name of a system to protect against injury in a side collision. - Seat belts with pretensioners, To make sure a seatbelt restrains an occupant as early as possible in a crash. - As well as load limiters, to help protect occupants from seatbelt-inflicted injury. Your infotainment system won’t save your life - but those airbags sure could. Your life is precious, don’t forfeit safety in favour of the nice-to-haves. Is your child learning to drive? Or maybe they’ve just passed their driver’s test. Chances are they’re begging you for their own set of wheels. Download the ebook, Guide to buying your child their first car, to help you navigate the inevitable debate over reliability and the ever coveted “cool” factors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c668da79-660d-47e2-bb94-98841bcc049d>"]},{"passage":"When it comes to today’s SUVs, cars, trucks, and minivans, electronic tech features are hugely important. These items are now an integral part of how you interact with your vehicle, as well as how your vehicle interacts with the cars around it on the road. They range from safety and security measures to communication and connectivity features. We’ve put together a list of the best automotive technologies to look for when buying a new car. Some of them serve as safety shields that you will hopefully never need to use, but you can take comfort knowing they’re there. Others assist with parking and visibility. And some of this tech helps you stay connected to friends and family, or quickly contact emergency services. When you shop for a vehicle with these features, the ideal ones make things easier without causing driver distraction. Here is our list of the best automotive technologies of 2022. 1. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nThis is a category of systems that can ensure that you know when a vehicle is in your blind spot, can keep you a safe distance from the car in front of you, and can keep your vehicle from drifting into another lane. One of the first examples of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) was anti-lock brakes. These are now standard equipment on every new car. In modern vehicles, there are now dozens of these systems. These advanced driver assist systems often come in bundled safety suites. Some examples are Toyota\nSafety Sense, Subaru\nEyeSight, Ford CoPilot360, Honda\nSensing, and Nissan\nSafety Shield 360. Even if a model you are shopping for doesn’t have ADAS as a bundle or suite of features, many automakers sell them as standalone options or include them as part of a specific trim level. Key features to look for\nAdaptive cruise control\nIn some ways, adaptive control is similar to regular cruise control. However, while adaptive cruise control also keeps your vehicle at a set speed, additionally it slows down or accelerates to keep a safe distance from the car in front of you. This uses sensors on the vehicle to detect if there is a vehicle in your blind spot. It signals that there’s a vehicle there with an alert on your side mirrors. Some pickup trucks also have a blind-spot alert that takes into account vehicles that are next to either side of your trailer while you tow. If you are trying to back out of a parking space and you can’t see around the vehicles on either side, rear cross-traffic alert will let you know if a vehicle is approaching. This system often uses radar units on the vehicle to detect cross traffic. In some cases, you’ll hear an alert and see arrows on the center screen that show from which direction the other car is coming. Front cross-traffic alert is especially handy when you’re exiting a blind alley or driveway. Some newer systems also prevent you from turning left across traffic if it senses a vehicle is in your path. Forward collision warning\/avoidance\nForward collision warning (FCW) senses if you are at risk of a potential collision with the vehicle ahead of you. Some systems can sense if there is a pending collision a few vehicles ahead. FCW can make sounds, flash display lights, or provide a tactile change to the way the steering wheel or brake pedal feels. Forward collision avoidance uses the FCW sensors and, if the driver doesn’t react quickly enough, adds automatic emergency braking to stop the vehicle. This feature will alert you if your vehicle starts drifting into another lane. If your vehicle does start to drift into another lane, lane-keep assist uses steering to keep your car in the lane. If your vehicle drifts into oncoming traffic, some systems will also use steering to get back onto the correct side of the road. Reverse brake assist\nIf this system senses an object behind your vehicle while backing up, reverse brake assist can use automatic emergency braking to stop your car, avoiding a collision. 2. Automatic emergency braking\nAs you can see from the examples above, automatic emergency braking is an essential part of safety tech. When the car senses that a collision is imminent, AEB activates your car’s brakes, potentially avoiding or minimizing an accident. AEB can react faster than a person and can start working before you hit the brakes. If you are braking and it senses you need to stop sooner, AEB can also brake harder than the pressure you’re applying.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4daee723-85f3-446d-9bc0-a4a57a911aab>"]}]}

The Garden District Tour\nGet The Full Experience\nWe’ll help you plan the perfect New Orleans vacation.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a ton of unique things to do in New Orleans, Louisiana. This city has much more to offer than just parties and Bourbon Street, and its party reputation hardly does NOLA justice. New Orleans is one of the oldest cities in America, with a fascinating French and Creole history. It’s the setting for young adult novels and movies like “Interview with a Vampire.”\nIf you’re a fan of literature, architecture, history or just up for getting a good scare, read on for my top picks of what to do in the city. 1) Go to the WWII Museum\nThe World War II museum is five buildings and holds one of the most extensive collections of World War II Memorabilia in the world. It’s possible to spend multiple days here given how much there is to see. I recommend you set aside a minimum of 3-4 hours for your visit. If you decide to come back, make sure to save your ticket as you get reduced admission on subsequent days. When you enter you are given dog tags to follow one soldier’s story throughout the exhibits. The displays are very personal, revealing humanizing details about the person whose items you see in a glass case. The visit can be very emotional so prepare yourself. There’s a movie that has an introduction by Tom Hanks and special effects throughout, like shaking seats and real airplanes being lifted up into the air. It’s worth paying extra to see the movie. 2) Visit Oak Alley and Laura Plantation\nYou need a car to go to Oak Alley and Laura Plantations but it’s well worth the journey. Oak Alley Plantation (pictured above) is said to have the prettiest view in Louisiana — the stunning walkway of massive oak trees. You can tour the premises and drink mint juleps at the restaurant on site. Laura Plantation is just a few miles away and is a great complement to Oak Alley since it’s a Creole Plantation. It’s brightly colored, which is how the boats on the Mississippi River identified the plantation when making their deliveries. The guided tour explains the history of the property and its namesake owner and is included with the price of admission. 3) Take a haunted walking tour of the city\nGhost lovers, vampire seekers and general fans of the paranormal will get a kick out of taking a haunted walking tour of the city. I went with Witches Brew Tours and had a great time. Our guide was very knowledgeable and told us tales that brought the city to life. Make no mistake about it — New Orleans has a dark history. From serial killers to murder\/suicides, there are plenty of creepy and gory details to give even the biggest skeptic a case of the heebie-jeebies. I recommend that you check for deals on Groupon or Living Social to get a discount on your booking, and wear comfortable shoes. 4) Listen to music on Frenchmen Street\nIf you want to catch live jazz music, Frenchmen Street is the place to be. It’s a favorite of locals and retains an authentic vibe despite the secret long being out on this space. We saw a great band with a skilled trumpet player on the second floor of Blue Nile, but my favorite is Bamboulas. I was there on Friday night and the band was outstanding, with people stopping in the streets to dance outside and look in through the windows. The party can go all night long on Frenchmen Street and with $6 drink specials and generally no cover except for special events, this is a great place to come, unwind and have a musical evening. 5) Tour the Garden District\nHave you ever seen “American Horror Story: Coven?” The Buckner Mansion in The Garden District is also known as Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies. The Garden District is where you’ll find New Orleans nicest houses, making this an essential stop for architecture lovers. You can reach the district by streetcar, just take the St. Charles route. Note that you need cash to ride the streetcar and they don’t always stop for new riders. Note to AHS fans: Madame LaLaurie’s home and torture chamber is also a real place and a popular stop on haunted walking tours. 6) Eat authentic New Orleans food\nIf there’s one thing you should do in New Orleans, it’s eat. For the best jambalaya, I recommend Coops Place where you’ll get a dish that’s hearty, tasty and doesn’t break the bank.\n\nI’ve taken a look at some of the ‘frightseeing’ tours on Flight Centre’s website that are guaranteed to send a shiver up (or down) your spine. Here are my personal favourites:\n- New Orleans Ghost Tour\nThe Big Easy is often referred to as ‘the most haunted city in the USA’ and after a two-hour walk through the city you may be inclined to agree. New Orleans has enjoyed a colourful history that encompasses ghosts, vampires and voodoo. The tour includes a visit to a haunted bar. - Concrete Shoes on the Vegas Mob Tour\nTake a two-hour tour to discover the fascinating history of Las Vegas. Made famous by colourful characters of dubious reputation (think Bugsy Siegel and Anthony ‘the Ant’ Spilotro) Sin City is only 75 years old but has been built on skimming, suicide, murders and general underworld activities giving rise to an interesting reputation. - Creepy Beasties in Edinburgh\nTake a look at Edinburgh’s dark side, including tales of witchcraft, plague and torture. Visit the dark scenes of mayhem, horrific torture murders and supernatural happenings as you walk along eerie alleyways and creepy courtyards of the old Town. Beware of the “jumper-ooters”!!! - Scandalous Sydney\nEver wanted to ride in a haunted Cadillac hearse? Discover Sydney’s bizarre and bloody past, oozing with convicts, crime scenes, sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll, scandals, celebrities and much more. This “Weird Sydney” history and ghost tour is informative and will tell you everything you need to know about the famous and infamous who shaped the city. These tours are guaranteed to leave you with some spine chilling memories. Have you done any spooky tours around the world? I’d love to hear from you if you have.\n\nNew Orleans tours are exceedingly popular due in large part to the fact there is just too much to see in this city in one or two week’s time. Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.\n\nGet out!”—thus, he said while laughing at the results, spooking the group. Perhaps such antics will inspire a new generation of ghost hunters, modeled after guide Kalila Katherina Smith of Haunted History Tours and author of New Orleans Ghosts, Voodoo and Vampires (2010). Judging from her book and a nighttime tour I had with her, it appears such ghost-hunting raconteurs need very little evidence—perhaps only a thrice-told anecdote or a bit of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo—in order to spin their fantastic tales. I am grateful to CFI Libraries Director Tim Binga for research assistance, and I also appreciate the professional assistance of the New Orleans Public Library in providing copies of early newspaper articles. - Arthur, Stanley Clisby. 1936.

Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ef455bdc-415c-45c2-81f7-7b05e4f715e4>"]},{"passage":"Get out!”—thus, he said while laughing at the results, spooking the group. Perhaps such antics will inspire a new generation of ghost hunters, modeled after guide Kalila Katherina Smith of Haunted History Tours and author of New Orleans Ghosts, Voodoo and Vampires (2010). Judging from her book and a nighttime tour I had with her, it appears such ghost-hunting raconteurs need very little evidence—perhaps only a thrice-told anecdote or a bit of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo—in order to spin their fantastic tales.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nitalicizing it could be better since I believe you should italicize words or phrases or titles that are foreign to napoleon made mistake in underestimating his opponents La familia - describing your family in spanish | spanish.

My thoughts in compiling this list are more in line with taking an off-center approach to a much abused topic. By that, I mean to jot down my impressions, good, bad or indifferent, of films I happened to have enjoyed (or not) in the venues in which they were originally shown: the movie theater. As readers of my blog are aware, movies have been a major preoccupation of mine for a number of years. And since nowadays most films can be viewed online or in the comfort of one’s home on a variety of platforms, I decided to give equal time to works that merit the wide-screen approach. That’s the way these films were meant to be seen — and that’s how I saw them. Another reason I decided to make this list was simple: due to time constraints, I have been unable to write a longer analysis. However, I do hope to remedy that situation in the near future. Indeed, many of these works require, no, DEMAND, a full-length commentary on their own. For now, though, I believe this year-end wrap-up will serve the purpose. The films are in chronological order by year. Happy 2018 everybody! A Spanish gothic adaptation of Snow White, with hints of magical realism and the Grand Guignol, Blancanieves took me and everyone who watched it by total surprise and sheer delight. Much as I experienced with Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when it was first shown in 2005, I found myself smiling all the way through while viewing this fabulous feature at the North Carolina Museum of Art — a most appropriate site for this work. For indeed, this is a definitive example of film art, a pièce de résistance and labor of love for Spanish writer-director Pablo Berger and his cast and crew. The wind was nearly taken out his sails, however, when Señor Berger was informed that his silent-film project would be overshadowed by Michel Hazanavicius’ The Artist (2011), which beat him to the punch by almost a year. Seen on its own terms, Blancanieves is the more challenging of the two for audiences unfamiliar with Spanish culture. Filmed in glorious black and white by cinematographer Kiko de la Rica, with an unforgettably haunting music score by Alfonso de Vilallonga, the plot takes a few liberties with the accustomed “happy ending” of most fairy tales, much to the film’s betterment. Set in and around Seville, Spain in the early 1920s — in particular, the bullfighting arena (with emphasis on Spanish artist Francisco Goya’s 19th-century Tauromaquia prints) — this revisionist retelling of Snow White (or “Blancanieves” in Spanish) tells the tale of little Carmen (Sofía Oria) and, as the young adult Carmen, Macarena García, the orphaned daughter of a once famous matador (Daniel Giménez Cacho). Through various plot contrivances and twists of fate, Carmen finds herself in the care of a troupe of wandering circus dwarfs, garnering fame through her travels as a female bullfighter. Of course, there’s a wicked stepmother, Encarna (played with lip-smacking glee by Maribel Verdú), and a perfidious henchman who doubles as her chauffeur (Pedro Ponce). Told through purely visual and musical terms, the film pays homage to Tod Browning’s Freaks, with references to the silent-film oeuvre of Abel Gance (Napoleon, Le Roue) and Carl Theodor Dreyer, especially The Passion of Joan of Arc in Berger’s close-ups of the bizarre and the grotesque. The purposely ambiguous ending will have you scratching your head for days, but if you are attuned to the director’s vision it should satisfy the insatiable critic in all of us.\n\nSince the 1950s, Spain has been home to an important tradition of experimental film cut off from conventional exhibition spaces. This series was designed to give this unknown branch of film the visibility it deserves. From more than a thousand films, forty-three were chosen to be screened at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in six sessions. In order to spark a dialogue between the different eras, this vastly diverse group of seminal films was shown out of chronological order, blazing a trail through the almost unknown history of Spanish cinema. The programme Documents\/Itineraries opened the series with Fuego en Castilla (1958-1960) by José Val del Omar (Granada, 1904-Madrid, 1982), one of the most important figures in Spanish film. The session concluded with works by Gabriel Blanco (Cadiz, 1936-1991), Benet Rossell (Lerida, 1937) and Antoni Miralda (Tarrasa, 1942), José Luis Guerín (Barcelona, 1960) and Virginia García del Pino (Barcelona, 1966). The cult classic Arrebato (1979), directed by Iván Zulueta (San Sebastian, 1943-2009), was included in the series to introduce the world to a masterpiece that is one of the most hypnotic films of all time, loaded with mysticism and open to numerous readings. Animated Experiments: rhythm, light and colour looks at different periods from the history of experimental animated film in Spain, from pure abstraction to narrative. …Ere erera baleibu izik aruaren…, a nonsense phrase, is the title of the first and only full-length animated feature in the history of Spanish cinema, a film entirely hand painted using animation techniques without a camera. Jose Antonio Sistiaga (San Sebastian, 1932) used 35 mm celluloid film as his canvas, applying paint directly to the film. Investigations\/Metafilm invites viewers to reflect on the essence of film in its different manifestations from cinematic essays to blank screen, passing through a dialogue with dance, performance art, photography and poetry. The programme Appropriations\/Great Super 8 sets up a conversation between the generation of filmmakers who tried to break into experimental film from the avant-garde in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia during the 1970s and the new crop appearing at the dawn of the 21st century. In addition to this retrospective of Spanish experimental film, the programme offers a chance to meet the artist Toni Serra (Barcelona, 1960) - whose film Minnesota 1943 (1995) is included in the series - with a presentation of his recent works, which explore the idea of trance and the reality of dreams.

Co-Creator and Executive Producer, Field of Vision\n1) Top Ten List\n1. “Standby for Tape Back-up” by Ross Sutherland\nA wonderfully unique film that takes even the most familiar popular culture and gives it a new, and powerful, story. Ross Sutherland’s use of performance and writing takes this film to another level and it’s one that I hope many people get to see. 2. “The Look of Silence” by Joshua Oppenheimer\nThe embodiment of the power of documentary. And so beautifully made. Joshua Oppenheimer is a master of the craft. 3. “The Nightmare” by Rodney Ascher\nI love when people utilize genre filmmaking in non-fiction and Rodney Ascher really plays with the power of horror in reality with “The Nightmare.” It’s a film that really freaks me out, but is so well-made that I can re-watch it. I’ll always check out anything Rodney makes. 4. “Above and Below” by Nicolas Steiner\nThat “Above and Below” is a graduation film means I’ll pay close attention to Nicolas Steiner’s future work, considering how magical this film is. 5. “Tangerine” by Sean Baker\nI loved every frame. It was captivating, the performances excellent and I loved the soundtrack. 6. “Mad Max: Fury Road” by George Miller\nI loved everything about “Mad Max” from the visuals, the scope and ambition, the characters and their progression. It was everything I could want from big scale fiction like that. 7. “Exotica, Erotica, etc” by Evangelia Kranioti\n“Exotica, Erotica, etc” is a stunning film. I love Evangelia Kranioti’s filmmaking, especially the use of fiction and documentary, and the incredible visuals. 8. “99 Homes” by Ramin Bahrani\nI have been wanting to re-watch “99 Homes” since I first saw it. The performances are excellent, it’s smart and tough to watch. I’d love to see more films like this. 9 and 10. The Shonda Rhimes and Duplass Brothers’ collective empires. Let these people do whatever they want. It’s for our own good. Notable Mentions: “Spotlight” is definitely one of the best films of the year for me, but was co-financed by our colleagues at First Look Media. So in the interests of impartiality only, it was not in my top 10. Other favorites include: “Hot Sugar’s Cold World,” “Magic Mike XXL,” “Deep Web,” “Listen to Me Marlon,” “Mend and Make Do,” “Western” and “Those Who Feel The Fire Burning.”\nAlways continue to try and find more ways to help filmmakers to get their work made, or out into the world. On a personal level: Write more, and produce more. 3) Looking Forward:\nI’m really excited to see what we can build Field of Vision into, and the films we’ll be able to put out into the world. And really I always most look forward to the unexpected films that blow me away. Senior Programmer, Tribeca Film Festival\n“The Big Short”\n“Dior and I”\nResolutions: Watch more TV.

Deputy Director & Head of Programming, IFP\n1.\n\nThis piece was originally published on the old blog in April 2015; it was a culmination of my investigations into ‘el otro cine español’ thus far, and also a form of preparation for attending the D’A Festival later that month. An earlier post – this one – explains why I was looking at this particular set of films. When I first started this new blog, I wrote a post outlining where I was up to with my ‘otro cine español’ project but not much has happened since (although if you click on the ‘otro cine español’ tag at the foot of this post, you will be able to see other connected pieces). My trip to the D’A Festival in April 2015 mainly stemmed from a realisation that if I wanted to see these films (and their newer incarnations), then I would need to travel to festivals because it is difficult to cross paths with them otherwise. But I’ve had to accept that I don’t currently have the resources for festival trips, and have put the project to one side for the time being – although I keep an eye on the various Spanish online platforms that might host such films. For now, this piece and the one written specifically for this blog are a summation of the project. I haven’t attempted to update the main part of the text (I haven’t stayed up to date with the saga of Spanish film finance, although I don’t expect that the situation has improved at all – if anything, it’s likely to have got worse) but I am rejigging the postscript because the availability status of several of the films has changed (so that info is current as of August 2017). Un impulso colectivo\nMarginal cinemas – or cinema being made on the margins, outside the norms of a given industrial context – are nearly always present, if not always widely visible. In the past few years in Spain, specific actions by the Rajoy government (for example, dismantling the existing film finance infrastructure without putting anything in its place, and in September 2012 raising the IVA [VAT] on entertainment (including cinema tickets) from 8% to 21%), in combination with the dire economic situation, have thrown film production in Spain into disarray and further undermined confidence in the Spanish film industry – an industry that was already habitually said to be in near-perpetual crisis. These circumstances have exacerbated the financial precariousness of those filmmakers already operating on the margins; the current reliance on self-funding and \/ or crowdfunding is not sustainable in the long term, and nor does it afford people a secure way of making a living. At the same time, the visibility of these films on the margins has increased because their success at film festivals abroad has raised their profiles at home. This international recognition is often presented by the press as a fillip for a beleaguered industry that these filmmakers nonetheless remain outside of. From an outsider’s perspective (i.e. mine), there seem to be two events that crystallised the growing attention directed at goings-on on the margins: the September 2013 issue of Caimán Cuadernos de Cine, which was dedicated to ‘el otro cine español’ (the first time I had seen these films presented as being related to each other, despite their disparities), and the ‘Un impulso colectivo’ [A Collective Impulse] section (which takes its name from programmer Carlos Losilla’s Caimán article) at the D’A – Festival Internacional de Cinema D’Autor de Barcelona in April 2014. That’s not to say that these types of films weren’t being supported and championed elsewhere – many screened abroad and \/ or at festivals such as San Sebastián and Seville prior to these two events – but Caimán and the D’A Festival drew attention to the films and filmmakers as a group in a way that seems important to me because cinema is not created in a vacuum, and the idea of a group (however nebulous) foregrounds that these films are not isolated or unrelated occurrences. A brief outline of each of the 14 films in ‘Un impulso colectivo’ can be found here. In this post I am going to consider the films as a group in order to highlight some areas of commonality across the programme. Form follows content –\nThe ‘Un impulso colectivo’ programme offered a panorama of marginal cinema(s) in Spain, encompassing a range of financial models (including self-financing, crowdfunding, local grants and subsidies) and diverse genres and styles (a deadpan sci-fi, a musical-comedy, essay films, documentaries, and social dramas among them).\n\nThis is the story of a young Irish woman who comes to Spain to escape from the pressures she feels about her impending marriage to a political activist in Ireland.

Written by\nLisa Dowling <email@example.com>\nI sat down to watch this last night, expecting to see the movie with Jennifer Love Hewitt (this one is called \"If Only\" on this side of the pond), and almost turned it off in the first 10 minutes. I'm glad I didn't. Douglas Henshaw looks so shambolic that its difficult to believe he pulled a poppet like Lena Headley, but he is a very good actor and gradually the movie draws you in, taking you on a whimsical ride in the style of Richard Curtis, albeit rather more subdued. My guess is that Penelope Cruz was there to provide American audiences with a familiar name, and she does an reasonable job without ever setting the screen alight. What I'd really like to know though is whether the characters of the Spanish garbagemen came about as a result of casting her, or vice-versa. Either way, it works well, and the resulting story of love, choices, fate and moving on is nicely told, without preaching. Unfortunately, I worked out what was going to happen about half an hour before the end, and for that reason can only give it 8\/10; but it was a good enough film to watch it out, and I'm sure it'll provide canoodling couples with a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for many years to come. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\n\nI am the writer and director of this feature film. I have always had an interest in romantic crime thrillers. I am thrilled that we can present our film project on this site ... and the possibility that\nbackers around the world will be able to participate in making this dream ... a reality. \"Blood on the Streets\" is the story about a mysterious detective, a beautiful woman, and a criminal family in Madrid, Spain who launches a\nbloody war when someone crosses over to the other side and commits the ultimate sin of betrayal. It is an English\/Spanish language full-length\nfeature film that combines action, romance, and suspense. We have traveled to Spain to scout locations. We met with actors, talent agencies and production companies. Spain is known for having a very\nwell-established film infrastructure as well as their talented cast and crews. And, it is cheaper to shoot in Spain. Once we are funded, we will\ntravel to Spain and begin our preproduction and production schedule. We have a completed script ... Completed storyboards (shot for shot) ...\nLetter of interest from an award winning director of photography ... Letters of interest from bilingual Latin American and Spaniard Actors ... Please feel free to view the actors demos and resumes at ... Soaring cinematic score ...\nWe have spoken to several distributors. They have all expressed interest in the film project. They have asked us to contact them once we are\nfunded and we can show them a rough cut of the film. We plan on having a screening for them. We have contacted a few US talent agencies. They are also interested in being involved in the film project. If we our able to raise our projected\nbudget, then we can cast a couple of American stars. What is the synopsis of the film? Blood on the Streets is the story about a mysterious detective name Curtis Raven who falls in love with Sylvia Buñuel, a beautiful woman with\na secret past. Sylvia is searching for her missing brother David. She hires Curtis to find him, but they come up against a ruthless crime family. Franco Scala is the head of the family and will destroy anyone who comes across his path. Franco has escaped from prison and once again\nbegins his reign of threats and extortion. Franco makes the fatal mistake of getting involved in a love triangle that quickly becomes entangled\ninto a web of deceit and murder. He’s forced to hide in an abandoned warehouse with a hostage in tow. Five years ago, Franco had left Curtis\nfor dead in a dark alley. And now, Curtis has returned to exact his revenge in a fight to the death. But not everything looks as it appears and we\nare left with a surprising twist at the end. Yes. All of the actors from Latin America and Spain are fully bilingual. Have you thought about having an English and Spanish version? Yes. We are interested in shooting a film simultaneously in both English and Spanish and release both versions in domestic and international\nmarkets. Four or five takes in English. Then, four or five takes in Spanish. All of the actors are looking forward to this challenge. Have you thought about shooting the film in the US? Yes, but after making trips to various locations in Spain, meeting with the talented casts and crews, and that it is less expensive ... it makes\nsense both financially and logistically ... to shoot the entire film on location in Spain. Why are you interested in using the thriller genre in the film? Blood on the Streets will use the thriller genre to explore the romance, passion, the sorrow, and the triumph of a deeply human story that is\ncommon to us all. Blood on the Streets is intended to offer all of its audiences a portrait of a man who seeks revenge and the other his\nBlood on the Streets provides an opportunity to fully explore the story of two different men. One of them wants his revenge over being left for\ndead in a dark alley. The other man is a hardened criminal who will destroy anyone who gets in his way. There are several women who\nbecome involved with these men and ultimately some of them meet their final fate at the end. Our film provides a fresh and new prospective\non this story … yet the themes of the thriller are still familiar to a universal audience. What format will you be shooting in? We will be shooting in Sony HD. What will be the total running time of the film? The film should run about 90 to 95 minutes long. Do you have any other feature film projects that you intend to shoot in Latin America or Spain? Letter of interest from an award winning sound designer ...\n\nHow did you get interested in filmmaking? By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.","passages":[{"passage":"A roll of 16mm. Eachone a story.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd69f2a9-26d8-4ad2-adde-ec2503b52170>"]},{"passage":"italicizing it could be better since I believe you should italicize words or phrases or titles that are foreign to napoleon made mistake in underestimating his opponents La familia - describing your family in spanish | spanish.

My thoughts in compiling this list are more in line with taking an off-center approach to a much abused topic. By that, I mean to jot down my impressions, good, bad or indifferent, of films I happened to have enjoyed (or not) in the venues in which they were originally shown: the movie theater. As readers of my blog are aware, movies have been a major preoccupation of mine for a number of years. And since nowadays most films can be viewed online or in the comfort of one’s home on a variety of platforms, I decided to give equal time to works that merit the wide-screen approach. That’s the way these films were meant to be seen — and that’s how I saw them. Another reason I decided to make this list was simple: due to time constraints, I have been unable to write a longer analysis. However, I do hope to remedy that situation in the near future. Indeed, many of these works require, no, DEMAND, a full-length commentary on their own. For now, though, I believe this year-end wrap-up will serve the purpose. The films are in chronological order by year. Happy 2018 everybody! A Spanish gothic adaptation of Snow White, with hints of magical realism and the Grand Guignol, Blancanieves took me and everyone who watched it by total surprise and sheer delight. Much as I experienced with Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when it was first shown in 2005, I found myself smiling all the way through while viewing this fabulous feature at the North Carolina Museum of Art — a most appropriate site for this work. For indeed, this is a definitive example of film art, a pièce de résistance and labor of love for Spanish writer-director Pablo Berger and his cast and crew. The wind was nearly taken out his sails, however, when Señor Berger was informed that his silent-film project would be overshadowed by Michel Hazanavicius’ The Artist (2011), which beat him to the punch by almost a year. Seen on its own terms, Blancanieves is the more challenging of the two for audiences unfamiliar with Spanish culture. Filmed in glorious black and white by cinematographer Kiko de la Rica, with an unforgettably haunting music score by Alfonso de Vilallonga, the plot takes a few liberties with the accustomed “happy ending” of most fairy tales, much to the film’s betterment. Set in and around Seville, Spain in the early 1920s — in particular, the bullfighting arena (with emphasis on Spanish artist Francisco Goya’s 19th-century Tauromaquia prints) — this revisionist retelling of Snow White (or “Blancanieves” in Spanish) tells the tale of little Carmen (Sofía Oria) and, as the young adult Carmen, Macarena García, the orphaned daughter of a once famous matador (Daniel Giménez Cacho). Through various plot contrivances and twists of fate, Carmen finds herself in the care of a troupe of wandering circus dwarfs, garnering fame through her travels as a female bullfighter. Of course, there’s a wicked stepmother, Encarna (played with lip-smacking glee by Maribel Verdú), and a perfidious henchman who doubles as her chauffeur (Pedro Ponce). Told through purely visual and musical terms, the film pays homage to Tod Browning’s Freaks, with references to the silent-film oeuvre of Abel Gance (Napoleon, Le Roue) and Carl Theodor Dreyer, especially The Passion of Joan of Arc in Berger’s close-ups of the bizarre and the grotesque. The purposely ambiguous ending will have you scratching your head for days, but if you are attuned to the director’s vision it should satisfy the insatiable critic in all of us.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a92bd9f2-5386-4ac7-bc96-c59807126e81>"]},{"passage":"Since the 1950s, Spain has been home to an important tradition of experimental film cut off from conventional exhibition spaces. This series was designed to give this unknown branch of film the visibility it deserves. From more than a thousand films, forty-three were chosen to be screened at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in six sessions. In order to spark a dialogue between the different eras, this vastly diverse group of seminal films was shown out of chronological order, blazing a trail through the almost unknown history of Spanish cinema. The programme Documents\/Itineraries opened the series with Fuego en Castilla (1958-1960) by José Val del Omar (Granada, 1904-Madrid, 1982), one of the most important figures in Spanish film. The session concluded with works by Gabriel Blanco (Cadiz, 1936-1991), Benet Rossell (Lerida, 1937) and Antoni Miralda (Tarrasa, 1942), José Luis Guerín (Barcelona, 1960) and Virginia García del Pino (Barcelona, 1966). The cult classic Arrebato (1979), directed by Iván Zulueta (San Sebastian, 1943-2009), was included in the series to introduce the world to a masterpiece that is one of the most hypnotic films of all time, loaded with mysticism and open to numerous readings. Animated Experiments: rhythm, light and colour looks at different periods from the history of experimental animated film in Spain, from pure abstraction to narrative. …Ere erera baleibu izik aruaren…, a nonsense phrase, is the title of the first and only full-length animated feature in the history of Spanish cinema, a film entirely hand painted using animation techniques without a camera. Jose Antonio Sistiaga (San Sebastian, 1932) used 35 mm celluloid film as his canvas, applying paint directly to the film. Investigations\/Metafilm invites viewers to reflect on the essence of film in its different manifestations from cinematic essays to blank screen, passing through a dialogue with dance, performance art, photography and poetry. The programme Appropriations\/Great Super 8 sets up a conversation between the generation of filmmakers who tried to break into experimental film from the avant-garde in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia during the 1970s and the new crop appearing at the dawn of the 21st century. In addition to this retrospective of Spanish experimental film, the programme offers a chance to meet the artist Toni Serra (Barcelona, 1960) - whose film Minnesota 1943 (1995) is included in the series - with a presentation of his recent works, which explore the idea of trance and the reality of dreams.

Ross Sutherland’s use of performance and writing takes this film to another level and it’s one that I hope many people get to see. 2. “The Look of Silence” by Joshua Oppenheimer\nThe embodiment of the power of documentary. And so beautifully made. Joshua Oppenheimer is a master of the craft. 3. “The Nightmare” by Rodney Ascher\nI love when people utilize genre filmmaking in non-fiction and Rodney Ascher really plays with the power of horror in reality with “The Nightmare.” It’s a film that really freaks me out, but is so well-made that I can re-watch it. I’ll always check out anything Rodney makes. 4. “Above and Below” by Nicolas Steiner\nThat “Above and Below” is a graduation film means I’ll pay close attention to Nicolas Steiner’s future work, considering how magical this film is. 5. “Tangerine” by Sean Baker\nI loved every frame. It was captivating, the performances excellent and I loved the soundtrack. 6. “Mad Max: Fury Road” by George Miller\nI loved everything about “Mad Max” from the visuals, the scope and ambition, the characters and their progression. It was everything I could want from big scale fiction like that. 7. “Exotica, Erotica, etc” by Evangelia Kranioti\n“Exotica, Erotica, etc” is a stunning film. I love Evangelia Kranioti’s filmmaking, especially the use of fiction and documentary, and the incredible visuals. 8. “99 Homes” by Ramin Bahrani\nI have been wanting to re-watch “99 Homes” since I first saw it. The performances are excellent, it’s smart and tough to watch. I’d love to see more films like this. 9 and 10. The Shonda Rhimes and Duplass Brothers’ collective empires.

Notable Mentions: “Spotlight” is definitely one of the best films of the year for me, but was co-financed by our colleagues at First Look Media. So in the interests of impartiality only, it was not in my top 10. Other favorites include: “Hot Sugar’s Cold World,” “Magic Mike XXL,” “Deep Web,” “Listen to Me Marlon,” “Mend and Make Do,” “Western” and “Those Who Feel The Fire Burning.”\nAlways continue to try and find more ways to help filmmakers to get their work made, or out into the world. On a personal level: Write more, and produce more. 3) Looking Forward:\nI’m really excited to see what we can build Field of Vision into, and the films we’ll be able to put out into the world.

An earlier post – this one – explains why I was looking at this particular set of films. When I first started this new blog, I wrote a post outlining where I was up to with my ‘otro cine español’ project but not much has happened since (although if you click on the ‘otro cine español’ tag at the foot of this post, you will be able to see other connected pieces). My trip to the D’A Festival in April 2015 mainly stemmed from a realisation that if I wanted to see these films (and their newer incarnations), then I would need to travel to festivals because it is difficult to cross paths with them otherwise. But I’ve had to accept that I don’t currently have the resources for festival trips, and have put the project to one side for the time being – although I keep an eye on the various Spanish online platforms that might host such films. For now, this piece and the one written specifically for this blog are a summation of the project. I haven’t attempted to update the main part of the text (I haven’t stayed up to date with the saga of Spanish film finance, although I don’t expect that the situation has improved at all – if anything, it’s likely to have got worse) but I am rejigging the postscript because the availability status of several of the films has changed (so that info is current as of August 2017). Un impulso colectivo\nMarginal cinemas – or cinema being made on the margins, outside the norms of a given industrial context – are nearly always present, if not always widely visible. In the past few years in Spain, specific actions by the Rajoy government (for example, dismantling the existing film finance infrastructure without putting anything in its place, and in September 2012 raising the IVA [VAT] on entertainment (including cinema tickets) from 8% to 21%), in combination with the dire economic situation, have thrown film production in Spain into disarray and further undermined confidence in the Spanish film industry – an industry that was already habitually said to be in near-perpetual crisis. These circumstances have exacerbated the financial precariousness of those filmmakers already operating on the margins; the current reliance on self-funding and \/ or crowdfunding is not sustainable in the long term, and nor does it afford people a secure way of making a living. At the same time, the visibility of these films on the margins has increased because their success at film festivals abroad has raised their profiles at home. This international recognition is often presented by the press as a fillip for a beleaguered industry that these filmmakers nonetheless remain outside of. From an outsider’s perspective (i.e. mine), there seem to be two events that crystallised the growing attention directed at goings-on on the margins: the September 2013 issue of Caimán Cuadernos de Cine, which was dedicated to ‘el otro cine español’ (the first time I had seen these films presented as being related to each other, despite their disparities), and the ‘Un impulso colectivo’ [A Collective Impulse] section (which takes its name from programmer Carlos Losilla’s Caimán article) at the D’A – Festival Internacional de Cinema D’Autor de Barcelona in April 2014. That’s not to say that these types of films weren’t being supported and championed elsewhere – many screened abroad and \/ or at festivals such as San Sebastián and Seville prior to these two events – but Caimán and the D’A Festival drew attention to the films and filmmakers as a group in a way that seems important to me because cinema is not created in a vacuum, and the idea of a group (however nebulous) foregrounds that these films are not isolated or unrelated occurrences. A brief outline of each of the 14 films in ‘Un impulso colectivo’ can be found here. In this post I am going to consider the films as a group in order to highlight some areas of commonality across the programme. Form follows content –\nThe ‘Un impulso colectivo’ programme offered a panorama of marginal cinema(s) in Spain, encompassing a range of financial models (including self-financing, crowdfunding, local grants and subsidies) and diverse genres and styles (a deadpan sci-fi, a musical-comedy, essay films, documentaries, and social dramas among them).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8d038da1-775f-4af5-8e45-945e99ded6e6>"]},{"passage":"This is the story of a young Irish woman who comes to Spain to escape from the pressures she feels about her impending marriage to a political activist in Ireland.

Written by\nLisa Dowling <email@example.com>\nI sat down to watch this last night, expecting to see the movie with Jennifer Love Hewitt (this one is called \"If Only\" on this side of the pond), and almost turned it off in the first 10 minutes. I'm glad I didn't. Douglas Henshaw looks so shambolic that its difficult to believe he pulled a poppet like Lena Headley, but he is a very good actor and gradually the movie draws you in, taking you on a whimsical ride in the style of Richard Curtis, albeit rather more subdued. My guess is that Penelope Cruz was there to provide American audiences with a familiar name, and she does an reasonable job without ever setting the screen alight. What I'd really like to know though is whether the characters of the Spanish garbagemen came about as a result of casting her, or vice-versa. Either way, it works well, and the resulting story of love, choices, fate and moving on is nicely told, without preaching. Unfortunately, I worked out what was going to happen about half an hour before the end, and for that reason can only give it 8\/10; but it was a good enough film to watch it out, and I'm sure it'll provide canoodling couples with a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for many years to come. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.

I have always had an interest in romantic crime thrillers. I am thrilled that we can present our film project on this site ... and the possibility that\nbackers around the world will be able to participate in making this dream ... a reality. \"Blood on the Streets\" is the story about a mysterious detective, a beautiful woman, and a criminal family in Madrid, Spain who launches a\nbloody war when someone crosses over to the other side and commits the ultimate sin of betrayal. It is an English\/Spanish language full-length\nfeature film that combines action, romance, and suspense. We have traveled to Spain to scout locations. We met with actors, talent agencies and production companies. Spain is known for having a very\nwell-established film infrastructure as well as their talented cast and crews.

They have asked us to contact them once we are\nfunded and we can show them a rough cut of the film. We plan on having a screening for them. We have contacted a few US talent agencies. They are also interested in being involved in the film project. If we our able to raise our projected\nbudget, then we can cast a couple of American stars. What is the synopsis of the film? Blood on the Streets is the story about a mysterious detective name Curtis Raven who falls in love with Sylvia Buñuel, a beautiful woman with\na secret past. Sylvia is searching for her missing brother David. She hires Curtis to find him, but they come up against a ruthless crime family. Franco Scala is the head of the family and will destroy anyone who comes across his path. Franco has escaped from prison and once again\nbegins his reign of threats and extortion. Franco makes the fatal mistake of getting involved in a love triangle that quickly becomes entangled\ninto a web of deceit and murder. He’s forced to hide in an abandoned warehouse with a hostage in tow. Five years ago, Franco had left Curtis\nfor dead in a dark alley. And now, Curtis has returned to exact his revenge in a fight to the death. But not everything looks as it appears and we\nare left with a surprising twist at the end. Yes. All of the actors from Latin America and Spain are fully bilingual. Have you thought about having an English and Spanish version? Yes. We are interested in shooting a film simultaneously in both English and Spanish and release both versions in domestic and international\nmarkets. Four or five takes in English. Then, four or five takes in Spanish. All of the actors are looking forward to this challenge. Have you thought about shooting the film in the US? Yes, but after making trips to various locations in Spain, meeting with the talented casts and crews, and that it is less expensive ... it makes\nsense both financially and logistically ... to shoot the entire film on location in Spain. Why are you interested in using the thriller genre in the film?

By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:387bb762-3aba-4518-a585-f4834a1b5a14>"]}]}

Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.\n\n- Published in issue 5\/2019 on page 36\nMicrocontroller Kits for intermediate Users\nFor more challenging projects\nIf you've been dealing with the Arduino Uno or other 8-bit controller boards, but now need more processing power for more demanding projects, 32-bitters and professional development environments are the way forward. Taking the plunge is not as daunting as you imagined, as Elektor authors Viacheslav Gromov and Tam Hanna show in this article.\n\n[Update - we're taking feedback for a new '1284P-powered board!] Have you run out of RAM in your project, and find the Uno just doesn't quite cut it? But the much more powerful ARM-based Arduinos such as the Due are too big, and don't work with your 5V Arduino shields? Goldilocks is the answer: an Arduino-compatible board designed to be not too big, and not too small. It's just right. The ATmega1284p MCU is significantly more powerful than the ATmega328p and ATmega32u4 found in common 8-bit Arduino boards. With more memory and a higher clock speed than standard Arduino boards this may be just what you need to get your project done. |Freetronics Goldilocks||Arduino Uno||Arduino Leonardo|\n- 5V operation compatible with the widest possible range of shields\n- ATmega1284P primary MCU\n- ATmega32u2 secondary MCU for USB-serial conversion\n- Isolation cuts so you can reconfigure every I\/O pin individually\n- Prototyping area to add your own parts\n- Breakouts in top right outside shield footprint to add vertical modules etc\n- Optional SPI cross-links between primary and secondary MCUs for advanced features such as running the secondary MCU as a dedicated onboard programmer for uploading directly without using the Arduino bootloader\n- TX\/RX isolation cuts so you can run the primary and secondary MCUs independently as if it was 2 Arduinos on one PCB\n- Breakouts for ATmega32u2 I\/O so you can have it interact with other devices independently of the primary MCU\n- Dual hardware serial ports on primary MCU. The second serial port has been placed on pins D2\/D3 to make it drop-in compatible with the Arduino WiFi shield. No more software serial required! - 7-28V input voltage range switchmode power supply with up to 2A output for high-current shields such as GSM shields\n- JTAG breakout for primary MCU for advanced debugging\n- I2C breakouts near prototyping area\n- Optional I2C cross-links between the R3 position and A4\/A5, allowing you to decide if you want I2C on the A4\/A5 headers for compatibility with R2 shields or want it separate so you can use A4\/A5 as independent pins while still using I2C on the R3 headers\n- Independent reset buttons for the primary and secondary MCUs\n- Onboard 32.768kHz crystal for ATmega1284P internal RTC feature\n- LEDs placed on extended tab for visibility when a shield is placed on top\n- MicroSD card slot for convenient data storage\n- 4-layer PCB with dedicated GND and power planes plus optimally placed decoupling capacitors near primary MCU for maximum noise immunity and ADC accuracy\n- Gold plated PCB for maximum durability\n- Supplied with USB cable\n\nChoosing an Arduino for Your Project\nThe next step in the Arduino evolutionary chain was merging the USB-to-Serial programming part of the board onto the main MCU. That meant we had to leave the ATmega328 behind -- because it doesn't natively support USB -- in favor of the ATmega32U4. Aside from the additional USB support, the 32U4 is largely similar to the 328. Both are 8-bit AVRs with 32kB of flash memory, 22-ish I\/O lines, ADCs, UARTs, timers, etc. These ATmega32U4 boards often have the benefit of being cheaper than the ATmega328-based boards -- there's one less costly IC to put on there. They can also do things regular Arduino boards can't, like emulate a USB keyboard\/mouse. On the downside, they can be less reliable, and more difficult to use. The Leonardo is the patriarch of all ATmega32U4 Arduino boards. It shares the same form factor and I\/O placement (analog, PWM, I2C pins in the same place) as the Arduino Uno, so it remains shield compatible. Arduino Leonardo with HeadersDEV-11286\nDifferences between the Leonardo and the Uno? Aside from the new microcontroller, and lack of a second USB-to-Serial-converting IC, there's not many. The USB connector is different, the Leonardo connects to a computer via a micro-B USB cable. The driver installation process is also a bit more involved -- sometimes it can take a little extra fidgeting to get the board installed on your computer. Just as the Pro Mini took the guts of the Arduino Uno and shrunk them down, the Pro Micro works as a miniature version of the Leonardo. Unlike the Pro Mini, the Pro Micro doesn't require an external board to upload a sketch -- the 32U4 takes care of everything! Pro Micros are among the more complicated Arduino boards to get up and running. There are extra steps required to enable them in your Arduino environment, and a misstep can (at least temporarily) \"brick\" the Pro Micro. These boards are a good choice if you're an advanced Arduino-er and have a small USB-oriented project in mind (a mini USB keyboard\/mouse?). There are plenty of other riffs on the Leonardo design as well. There's the Fio v3, for any Arduino Leonardo project you might want to add an XBee to. Or the Qduino Mini which adds a LiPo charger and battery fuel gauge, and two RGB LEDs (one for status and another that is user programmable!). The board was designed by Quin at the age of 14 and manufactured at SparkFun. Bare Conductive Touch Board\nThen there is the Bare Conductive touch board. Basically it is a Arduino Leonardo designed to turn almost any material or surface into a sensor. The board comes with a built-in capacitive touch sensor, a MP3 decoder IC, microSD card socket, and LiPo charge IC to create light switches, musical instruments, custom interactive surfaces.\n\nFor debugging your programs, you need to do workarounds to see the Serial.prints() in your setup() routine. Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.\n\nApprox.

In addition to all the features of the previous board, the Uno now uses an ATmega16U2 instead of the 8U2 found on the Uno (or the FTDI found on previous generations). This allows for faster transfer rates and more memory. No drivers needed for Linux or Mac (inf file for Windows is needed and included in the Arduino IDE), and the ability to have the Uno show up as a keyboard, mouse, joystick, etc. The Uno R3 also adds SDA and SCL pins next to the AREF. In addition, there are two new pins placed near the RESET pin. One is the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. The other is a not connected and is reserved for future purposes. The Uno R3 works with all existing shields but can adapt to new shields which use these additional pins. Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i\/o board and a development environment that implements theProcessing\/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP). The open-source IDE can be downloaded for free (currently for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux). Note: The Arduino Uno R3 requires the Arduino 1.0 drivers folder in order to install properly on some computers. We have tested and confirmed that the R3 can be programmed in older versions of the IDE. However, the first time using the R3 on a new computer, you will need to have Arduino 1.0 installed on that machine.

Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7c5d5e43-7417-4570-8ecf-9acade1da1ed>"]},{"passage":"- Published in issue 5\/2019 on page 36\nMicrocontroller Kits for intermediate Users\nFor more challenging projects\nIf you've been dealing with the Arduino Uno or other 8-bit controller boards, but now need more processing power for more demanding projects, 32-bitters and professional development environments are the way forward.

Goldilocks is the answer: an Arduino-compatible board designed to be not too big, and not too small. It's just right. The ATmega1284p MCU is significantly more powerful than the ATmega328p and ATmega32u4 found in common 8-bit Arduino boards.

That meant we had to leave the ATmega328 behind -- because it doesn't natively support USB -- in favor of the ATmega32U4. Aside from the additional USB support, the 32U4 is largely similar to the 328. Both are 8-bit AVRs with 32kB of flash memory, 22-ish I\/O lines, ADCs, UARTs, timers, etc. These ATmega32U4 boards often have the benefit of being cheaper than the ATmega328-based boards -- there's one less costly IC to put on there. They can also do things regular Arduino boards can't, like emulate a USB keyboard\/mouse. On the downside, they can be less reliable, and more difficult to use. The Leonardo is the patriarch of all ATmega32U4 Arduino boards. It shares the same form factor and I\/O placement (analog, PWM, I2C pins in the same place) as the Arduino Uno, so it remains shield compatible. Arduino Leonardo with HeadersDEV-11286\nDifferences between the Leonardo and the Uno? Aside from the new microcontroller, and lack of a second USB-to-Serial-converting IC, there's not many. The USB connector is different, the Leonardo connects to a computer via a micro-B USB cable. The driver installation process is also a bit more involved -- sometimes it can take a little extra fidgeting to get the board installed on your computer. Just as the Pro Mini took the guts of the Arduino Uno and shrunk them down, the Pro Micro works as a miniature version of the Leonardo. Unlike the Pro Mini, the Pro Micro doesn't require an external board to upload a sketch -- the 32U4 takes care of everything! Pro Micros are among the more complicated Arduino boards to get up and running. There are extra steps required to enable them in your Arduino environment, and a misstep can (at least temporarily) \"brick\" the Pro Micro. These boards are a good choice if you're an advanced Arduino-er and have a small USB-oriented project in mind (a mini USB keyboard\/mouse?). There are plenty of other riffs on the Leonardo design as well. There's the Fio v3, for any Arduino Leonardo project you might want to add an XBee to. Or the Qduino Mini which adds a LiPo charger and battery fuel gauge, and two RGB LEDs (one for status and another that is user programmable!). The board was designed by Quin at the age of 14 and manufactured at SparkFun. Bare Conductive Touch Board\nThen there is the Bare Conductive touch board. Basically it is a Arduino Leonardo designed to turn almost any material or surface into a sensor. The board comes with a built-in capacitive touch sensor, a MP3 decoder IC, microSD card socket, and LiPo charge IC to create light switches, musical instruments, custom interactive surfaces.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:01e44853-8b64-4adc-9336-8a881d5245bc>"]},{"passage":"For debugging your programs, you need to do workarounds to see the Serial.prints() in your setup() routine. Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project.

Tuesday, July 01, 2008\nThe Order of Canada recognizes a lifetime of outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the country. The motto inscribed on the medal is : He desired a better country. Certainly Morgentaler risked his life and his reputation on a cause no one else gave a damn about, and he is a hero to millions of Canadian women. \"The divisive debate about abortion rights in Canada is poised to erupt once again as Henry Morgentaler, the country's best-known abortion-rights crusader, is expected to be named to the Order of Canada.

In R.v.Morgentaler, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the jurisdiction of the state over women's bodies was unconstitutional. Justice Bertha Wilson wrote :\n\"The decision whether to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision, a matter of conscience. I do not think there is or can be any dispute about that. The question is: whose conscience? Is the conscience of the woman to be paramount or the conscience of the state?

To be appointed to the Senate, or some other cushy job with the federal government. Especially the ones that are unionized. -When you go to vote on election day, what do you do? I'm not a citizen yet, so why would I be voting? Look, I was just helping out that Liberal MP with some free pizzas during the campaign. Everything was legit and all. -Who is entitled to vote in Canadian federal elections? Anyone who isn't in jail, school or can convince the elections agent he's actually Canadian. -In Canada, are you obliged to tell other people how you voted? No, because nobody cares. -After an election, which party forms the government? Usually the Liberals, but not recently. -Who is your Member of Parliament? -What are the three levels of government? The federal, the provincial and the police who hand out the speeding tickets in my neighbourhood. I don't know who they work for but they must make a killing. -What is the role of the courts in Canada? To uphold the laws of Canada, unless it conflicts with their personal political beliefs. At that point they just make stuff up, and then use some latin terms to cover their tracks. -In Canada, are you allowed to question the police about their service or conduct? Yes, but not during the APEC conference, the G20, or if you're living in Caledonia. -Name two Canadian symbols. Don Cherry's ties. Peter Mansbridge's hairline. -What provinces are sometimes referred to as the Atlantic Provinces? The fish one. The Anne of Green Gables one. The ship on the dime one.

Tuesday, December 07, 2010\nCTF to Morton: Time to cut spending\nThe Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) presented Alberta’s Finance Minister Dr. Ted Morton with its 2011-12 pre-budget submission late yesterday, along with the message to the finance minister that it was time to start cutting spending. “This is 1988 all over again,” said CTF Alberta director Scott Hennig.“Despite the provincial government running record deficits, to date they have been unwilling to make any tough decisions. Plans to balance the budget don’t mean a thing unless action is taken.”\nIn its submission entitled “Roadmap to a Balanced Budget,” the CTF makes 25 recommendations to the provincial government for short, medium and long term solutions to balance the budget and put the province back on the right fiscal track. “Wage freezes for senior staff and hiring freezes aren’t going to fill a $5 billion hole in the budget,” said Hennig. “And they’re not going to fill next year’s $3.8 billion hole either.”\nThe CTF estimates the Alberta government could have a $3.8 billion deficit in 2011-12, based on current prices for oil, natural gas and the exchange rate. This is over three times more than the $1.1 billion deficit currently projected for 2011-12 by the Stelmach government. Some of the recommendations in the CTF’s 2011-12 pre-budget submission include:\n• a 5 per cent operational spending cut across all ministries;\n• extending the three-year capital plan over five years; • negotiating a 5 per cent roll back of government worker’s wages;\n• consider unpaid days off for non-essential government employees;\n• elimination of the carbon capture and storage program as well as the green transit (TRIP) funding;\n• reversing the 2008 MLA pay hike; • reducing the size of cabinet;\n• close entry to existing defined-benefit employee pension plans and create new defined-contribution pension plan; • no more borrowing or bond issues for capital. “This government has spent itself into a position where making cuts is the only option left. They cannot delay any longer, cuts need to be made,” concluded Hennig. The CTF’s 2011-12 pre-budget submission can be downloaded here. Steven Paikin on Police Brutality at G20\nFrom testimony before a parliamentary committee:\n“They took his accreditation because they wanted to check out whether he was who he said he was. Two police officers held him, He was chippy, he didn’t swear but he was talking a lot. He was saying ‘Why are you holding me. There is no need to hold me.\n\nAnd while the hurting hasn’t stopped, she feels pride in knowing her son did the right thing, she said. “I’ve lost my son, but he became part of history.”\nThe highest honor\nThe Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces. It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq. There were no Medals of Honor awarded during Operation Desert Storm or operations in Grenada, Panama and Lebanon. Source: U.S. Army\nAwards by service\nAlthough soldiers have received the lion’s share of the nation’s highest military award, Marines, sailors, airmen and one Coast Guardsman have earned the Medal of Honor as well. Here’s how the medals have been split among the services:\nAir Force: 17\nMarine Corps: 296\nCoast Guard: 1\nSource: Congressional Medal of Honor Society\n\nSome of the service medals and awards of the U.S. Military include, in descending order, the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Soldiers Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart and Meritorious Service Medal. Awards are worn as medals or ribbons on the left side of American military uniforms.Continue Reading\nThe Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the U.S. government. The president of the United States awards the medal, on behalf of Congress, for members of the U.S. military who perform above the call of duty. There are three separate types of Medals of Honor; which one is given depends upon the recipient's branch of service. The Army and the Air Force each have their own medals, and the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard all award the same medal. As of July 2014, more than 3,400 military members have been awarded the Medal of Honor. The Distinguished Service Cross is awarded for extraordinary heroism that is above and beyond other service awards, yet not at the level of the Medal of Honor. This army award is equal to the Navy Cross and Air Force Cross. The Navy Cross is for members of the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard.Learn more about Military\n\nAfter a string of recent controversies the honours system will be reformed, the government has announced. But is a gong the best way to show our appreciation anyway? By Brian Wheeler\nBBC News Online Magazine\nThe late Dusty Springfield probably summed it up best. When told she was going to receive an OBE, the singer reportedly said: \"Isn't that what they give to cleaners?\" It may have been a throwaway remark, and more than a little insulting to cleaners, but Dusty's words perfectly captured the absurdity of the British honours system in all its centuries-old glory. Sports stars and captains of industry are showered with gongs seemingly for doing their job, while so-called ordinary folk are given lesser baubles for selfless devotion to duty and tireless charity work. The whole system is class-bound, shrouded in secrecy and, critics argue, in dire need of reform. Now the government has pledged to do just that. There will be greater transparency and independent input, the cabinet office says. A review of the structure and membership of the committees which recommend honours is also promised. Two years ago, a secret review by Number 10 found the nine clandestine sub-committees that sift through the recommendations are predominantly made up of white, male civil servants over 50. The twice-yearly lists are still dominated by military figures and members of the civil service, the report found. The findings proved a bit too radical for the government, which kicked it into the long grass. It only came to light last month. \"A society should try to decide what kind of activities it wants to honour,\" says Labour MP Tony Wright, \"not just inherit a system that is full of inconsistencies and is based around class.\" Honours should be \"taken out of the hands of politicians\" and given to an independent committee, like in Australia, he says. But why have an honours system at all? Jamie Oliver got a gong\nCharles Mosley, editor-in-chief of Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, says the desire to recognise achievement - to set individuals above their peers - is part of human nature. \"It is one of the most basic human desires, along with sex and feeding your family and survival. If monkeys were better organised, they would have an honours system.\" Every country in the developed world has some kind of honours system: France its Legion of Honour and National Order of Merit; the US its Congressional Medal and Purple Heart. Even the former USSR had the Order of Lenin and Heroes of the Soviet Union. Honours perform an important function in society, helping to forge a sense of national identity and pride. Only the most churlish would begrudge the knighthood that will, inevitably, be bestowed on England rugby coach Clive Woodward, following his team's rugby World Cup triumph. Complex and opaque? The problem, critics argue, is that, in the UK, there are so many different grades of gratitude. No other country in the world has such a complex and opaque system. Some people receive the highest honours in the land for the flimsiest of reasons, while other more-deserving individuals are overlooked. Queen is \"fountain of honour\"\nBut she hands out awards on advice of ministers\nAbout 1,000 honours are on the PM's list each year\nOne in 123 diplomats gets an award, and one in 2,125 civil servants\nBut one in 15,500 teachers is honoured, and one in 20,000 nurses\nMany of the heroes of England's 1966 World Cup winning squad had to wait 34 years to receive any official recognition at all. Nobby Stiles, one of the members of the 1966 squad, says he was proud and honoured to receive an MBE from the Queen in 2000. \"It seemed a bit late but that was not the point. Times have changed,\" he told BBC News Online. Yet England captain Bobby Moore was given an OBE in 1967. \"It was said at the time that he was representing all of us. That is the way they said it.\" But did the rest of the team feel that way? \"I don't think so.\" Some have questioned whether sports stars and media figures should receive honours at all. \"Mr Blair seems to hand out honours to whoever is on television at the moment. More honours should be given to people who really deserve them.\n\nBy the end of 2015, hundreds of British D-Day veterans look set to receive the Legion d'Honneur, the highest honour that the French government can bestow. People looking for ex army jobs will be pleased to read this Western Morning News report on the news, featuring defence minister Mark Lancaster who told MPs that authorities in France are now prioritising cases involving veterans who are either approaching their 100th birthday or are seriously ill.\n\"To further assist the Legion authorities, we are resubmitting all cases where awards have not already been made at an agreed rate of 100 per week to avoid overtaxing the system,\" Mr Lancaster said, adding \"hurt and upset\" had in fact been caused by the months of delays that were seen because the Ministry of Defence had not anticipated the level of demand for the honour. It was thought that only a few hundred people would apply, but some 3,000 applications were received - and this number is on the increase all the time. The Legion of Honour was first established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte and is separated into five classifications - Chevalier, Officier, Commandeur, Grand Officier and Grand Croix. In order to be considered for the order, those in question need to demonstrate flawless performance in their line of work and go above and beyond what would typically be expected. The military distinctions are awarded for service or for extreme bravery. Last year, the French government told the Ministry of Defence it was keen to reward the acts of heroism displayed by veterans at the Normandy landings, while those involved in other campaigns to liberate France would also be considered eligible for the honour.comments powered by Disqus\n\nPROMINENT public figures and everyday heroes are often honoured by Britain with an MBE, OBE or CBE. But no doubt many of us will not know the real meaning of the prestigious awards, handed out twice a year. Here’s all you need to know…\nWhat’s the difference between an MBE, OBE and CBE? The lucky recipients of the MBE, OBE and CBE are announced a few days before the end of the year and around the Queen’s state birthday, June 17, 2017. They recognise the contributions and achievements of people from all walks of life, from Hollywood stars to humble volunteers. The three most well-known awards represent different ranks in the Order of the British Empire. The highest ranking of the three is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), followed by OBE (Officer) and then the MBE (Member). Can women be knighted? There is no female equivalent to a knighthood as women are appointed to an order of chivalry. Women who are appointed to the Most Noble Order of the Garter or the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle are given the title of Lady rather than Dame – which is used instead of the male title Sir. What are MBEs, OBEs and CBEs awarded for? The honours were created in 1917 by King George V during the First World War as a way of rewarding civilians and servicemen in support positions for their contribution to the war effort. Now they are used to recognise an achievement or service to the community in any area, such as the arts, charity or education. According to the Cabinet Office, an MBE is given for an “outstanding achievement or service to the community. This will have had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others”. An OBE is awarded for having a “major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area”. A CBE is awarded for having a “prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area”. The New Year’s Honours themselves date back to 1890 – read our history of the awards to find out more. WHAT CAN PEOPLE GET HONOURS FOR? - Making a difference to their community or field of work\n- Enhancing Britain’s reputation\n- Long-term voluntary service\n- Innovation and entrepreneurship\n- Changing things, with an emphasis on achievement\n- Improving life for people less able to help themselves\n- Displaying moral courage\nWhat is the Order of the British Empire? The British honours system actually has several orders, mostly relating to the monarchy, military and colonial officials. But King George V wanted to fill the gap by creating an order which would honour normal people. However, the order has come under some criticism due to its connection with the now extinct British Empire. The Government has considered changing the name to the Order of British Excellence, but decided not to make any changes until after the order’s centenary in 2017. Is a CBE the same as a “Sir”? The CBE is the third highest of the order’s five ranks but only the top two can use title Sir, for a man, or Dame, for a woman. The second highest rank is a KBE or DBE – a Knight or Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The top rank in the Order is a GBE – a Knight or Dame Grand Cross – but these are only given out very rarely. Since 2000, just 16 have been awarded, all to men. But, confusingly, people can still become a Sir or a Dame without receiving a KBE or a GBE as they can be knighted separately. Sir Elton John, for example, has a CBE but has also been made a Knight Bachelor, along with other celebs such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Ian McKellen. Only Brits can be made a Knight Bachelor, but foreigners can be awarded an honorary KBE. What does an MBE, OBE or CBE entitle you to? Anyone selected for an honour will be invited to attend an “investiture” ceremony at a royal residence where the Queen, or sometimes Prince Charles, Prince William or Princess Anne, will award them with their insignia – a medal – of the order.\n\nStructures of government\nFederal and provincial governments are elected through a representative democracy system. Areas of the country\/province are divided up equally and each area votes on a political representative. Elected officials need to have the most total votes of all candidates. Governments are formed based on which parties have the majority of representatives voted in. Municipal governments are not elected based on political parties, but rather through a group of independent candidates (councillors) who are led by a mayor. Voters in municipal elections in Alberta vote for their mayor and one or more councillors on regular 3-year intervals. The federal government is made up of the Parliament of Canada, which consists the House of Commons (the \"lower House\") and the Senate (the \"upper House\"). The House of Commons is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) from various political parties, while the Senate is made up of Senators appointed by the Prime Minister. The Governor General, Canada's representative of the Queen, oversees both houses. The House of Commons is the dominant branch of Parliament while both the Senate and the Governor General must approve proposed legislation. The Prime Minister is Canada's political leader. This position is not elected directly by the people. The leader the political party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Canada's Prime Minister. Decision making is mainly handled by the Cabinet of Canada, a committee chaired by the Prime Minister and made up of MPs from the political party that holds the majority of seats in the House of Commons. Parliament is located in Ottawa, Canada's capital city. The provincial government is similar in structure to the federal government. One major difference is the lack of a senate all provincial legislation is approved by the Lieutenant Governor, Alberta's representative of the Queen. Alberta's government is made up of the Legislative Assembly, with elected officials known as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The province's leader is known as the Premier. Like the federal Prime Minster, this position is awarded to the leader of the political party with the most seats in the Legislature. Key decisions are made by Alberta's cabinet, chaired by the Premier and comprised of MLAs from the political party with the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Alberta legislature is located in Edmonton, Alberta's capital city. Municipal governments lead local areas. They are led by a mayor and several independent councillors. Committees made up of small groups of councillors are often formed to focus on various municipal issues. These committees present their recommendations to the entire council, which then votes on proposed by-laws. Subscribe for information and resources relevant to you, delivered to your inbox. Date Updated: Thu, 19 Jun 2014 02:28:51\n\nWith the second round of voting in the Top Alberta Political Moment of the Decade contest now underway, here are some brief descriptions of the top 10 moments to vote for:\nVote – 2000: Thousands of Albertans protest the passage of private health care Bill 11. Albertans raised a massive protest against government plans for private health care and private hospitals. Opposition to Bill 11 is remembered for the the spontaneous nightly vigils at the Legislature. The government passed an amended version of Bill 11 that actually inhibited private health care more than it facilitated it. Vote – 2001: Ralph Klein berated the homeless in a late night visit to a mens shelter in Edmonton. Long-known for his enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, Premier Ralph Klein’s late night visit to the Herb Jamieson Centre changed how many Albertans viewed the Premier’s vice. Klein publicly apologized and pledged to stop drinking. Vote – 2004: Ralph Klein declared fiscal debate erased, making Alberta the first debt free province in a decade. At his July 12 Stampede Breakfast, Premier Klein declared Alberta to be ‘debt-free.’ The pursuit of erasing the provincial debt became the defining goal of the government in the 1990s and early 2000s. As the Chief of Staff to the President of Daveberta said, “the language of our elections and our politics is shaped around deficits and spending in a way that isn’t present in other politics.”\nVote – 2005: Gay marriage becomes legal in Alberta. Alberta began granting marriage licences to same-sex couples on July 20, upon the granting of Royal Assent to the federal Civil Marriage Act. After promising to continue opposing same-sex marriage, Premier Klein announced Alberta would would reluctantly recognize same-sex marriage, but promised new legislative protection for anyone who opposed it on moral or religious grounds. Vote – 2006: Calgary MP Stephen Harper became Prime Minister of Canada. On January 23, Calgary-Southwest MP Stephen Harper led the Conservative Party to defeat the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Paul Martin to form the first Conservative government since 1988. As the first Prime Minister from Alberta since Joe Clark, Harper’s election shifted the power dynamic in Alberta politics, making it more difficult for the provincial government to criticize the boogeymen in Ottawa. Vote – 2006: $400 Ralphbucks cheques mailed to every Albertan. An embodiment of short-term vision of a government with unprecedented financial wealth, the $400 Prosperity Bonuses were mailed to every Albertan. This represented $1.4 billion (or 20%) of the $6.8 billion surplus and was criticized by many Albertans as a pointless giveaway (but few actually refused the cheques). Vote – 2006: Ralph Klein received 55.4% approval in the PC leadership review. After 14 years in the Premier’s office and leading the PC party to four majority governments, low approval from convention delegates forced an early retirement for the man who dominated and defined Alberta politics since 1992. Vote – 2006: Ed Stelmach defeated Jim Dinning in the PC leadership contest. On December 2, former Finance Minister and Calgary’s favourite son Jim Dinning was unexpectedly defeated by 13-year MLA and former Lamont County Reeve Ed Stelmach. Stelmach became Alberta’s first Premier from rural Alberta since Harry Strom in 1971. Vote – 2008: Linda Duncan defeated Rahim Jaffer to become the second-ever NDP MP from Alberta. On October 17, Linda Duncan was elected as MP for Edmonton-Strathcona, defeating four-term Conservative MP Rahim Jaffer by 436 votes. The first NDP MP elected in Alberta was Edmonton-East MP Ross Harvey in 1988. Vote – 2009: Danielle Smith was elected leader of the Wildrose Alliance. Recent polls have shown major short-term growth in Wildrose Alliance support since Danielle Smith was elected leader on October 17, but it may be too soon to tell what long-term effect she will have on Alberta’s political scene. Smith is a former Calgary Board of Education Trustee and Director of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.\n\nThe British press, and thus the British political class, are all in a lather about the Honours system; as a result of a pair of leaks, there is decent chance that the system will be reformed. Below, I give a quick summary of how the system works, then summarize both the valid and the slightly peculiar aspects of the current criticisms of it, and then discuss what I consider to be the strong case in favor of a non-monetary system of reward and praise for those who contribute to the community. The biggest difficulties surround the implementation of an honors program in a manner that would be constitutional, fair and not stultifying. I don't have the perfect answer to that, but I do have some suggestions. The British Honours System\nTwice a year, that is at New Years and on the Queen’s Birthday (which is not the Queen’s actual birthday, but never mind), Her Majesty’s Government publishes a list of more than a thousand persons who will be granted various honors, or rather honours. The honours vary enormously. There are a variety of purely military awards, but the majority of them are for civilians who are rewarded for meritorious service to the community in any of a very wide variety of fields including politics, science, arts (both classical and popular), starting with MBEs which are medals called the “Member of the British Empire”, then ranging up through OBEs “Order of the British Empire”, to CBEs (Commander of the British Empire). MBEs are commonly given to long-serving postmen and church wardens and worthy folk who are not part of the ‘great and the good’; a CBE might be given to someone active in local politics, or to a popular actor or singer. The big awards, knighthoods, also come in various flavors and orders and ranks. For the Order of the Bath, these ranks are known to the cognoscenti as KG’s, KCMGs GCMG’s. While these really stand for Knight (Bachelor) of the Garter, Knight Commander and Knight Grand Cross of the Garter, the joke among the civil service – which gets the lion share of the elevated knighthoods – is that these stand for “Call me God,” “Kindly Call me God,” and “God Calls Me God”. Knighthoods (or, if the recipient is female, being named a Dame) differ from the lower honours in that after the recipient kneels before the Queen, they arise renamed. For example if Ms. Edna Average were to be made a Dame, she’d legally be Dame Edna, on her passport, credit cards, and so on, from then on. (In fact, there sort of is a Dame Edna[LINK], but that’s another story. There are also two special, separate honours called the Order of Merit (OM) which is limited to 24 living recipients at any time, and the Companion of Honour (CH), which are even higher than knighthoods, but don’t work a change on the name of the recipient. The OM is unusual among the major honours in that the Monarch actually selects them herself; almost all other honours other than those for members of the Royal Family, foreign Royals, and the Queen’s household are selected by the government although granted in the Queen’s name. It used to be that governments also handed out higher honours twice a year: peerages. Until a generation ago, peerages were inherited. Exactly what all the ranks are or were, I’ve never quite been sure I sorted out, but they included — in increasing order of precedence — Baronetcy, Baron, Viscount, Earl, Marquis, Duke. A Baronetcy is not a true peerage as it gives the inheritable right to be called ‘Sir Something’ but doesn’t carry with it the right to sit in the House of Lords. Like ordinary knights the holder has the right to vote, and can sit in the House of Commons if elected to it. True Peers of the Real, the Barons and up, lose their vote, and indeed lose their surnames, became Lord Something of Somewhere. Until recently all peers became life members of the House of Lords.","passages":[{"passage":"The whole story is ... extraordinary.

Tuesday, December 07, 2010\nCTF to Morton: Time to cut spending\nThe Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF) presented Alberta’s Finance Minister Dr. Ted Morton with its 2011-12 pre-budget submission late yesterday, along with the message to the finance minister that it was time to start cutting spending. “This is 1988 all over again,” said CTF Alberta director Scott Hennig.“Despite the provincial government running record deficits, to date they have been unwilling to make any tough decisions. Plans to balance the budget don’t mean a thing unless action is taken.”\nIn its submission entitled “Roadmap to a Balanced Budget,” the CTF makes 25 recommendations to the provincial government for short, medium and long term solutions to balance the budget and put the province back on the right fiscal track. “Wage freezes for senior staff and hiring freezes aren’t going to fill a $5 billion hole in the budget,” said Hennig. “And they’re not going to fill next year’s $3.8 billion hole either.”\nThe CTF estimates the Alberta government could have a $3.8 billion deficit in 2011-12, based on current prices for oil, natural gas and the exchange rate. This is over three times more than the $1.1 billion deficit currently projected for 2011-12 by the Stelmach government. Some of the recommendations in the CTF’s 2011-12 pre-budget submission include:\n• a 5 per cent operational spending cut across all ministries;\n• extending the three-year capital plan over five years; • negotiating a 5 per cent roll back of government worker’s wages;\n• consider unpaid days off for non-essential government employees;\n• elimination of the carbon capture and storage program as well as the green transit (TRIP) funding;\n• reversing the 2008 MLA pay hike; • reducing the size of cabinet;\n• close entry to existing defined-benefit employee pension plans and create new defined-contribution pension plan; • no more borrowing or bond issues for capital. “This government has spent itself into a position where making cuts is the only option left. They cannot delay any longer, cuts need to be made,” concluded Hennig. The CTF’s 2011-12 pre-budget submission can be downloaded here.

It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq. There were no Medals of Honor awarded during Operation Desert Storm or operations in Grenada, Panama and Lebanon.

As of July 2014, more than 3,400 military members have been awarded the Medal of Honor.

But is a gong the best way to show our appreciation anyway? By Brian Wheeler\nBBC News Online Magazine\nThe late Dusty Springfield probably summed it up best. When told she was going to receive an OBE, the singer reportedly said: \"Isn't that what they give to cleaners?\" It may have been a throwaway remark, and more than a little insulting to cleaners, but Dusty's words perfectly captured the absurdity of the British honours system in all its centuries-old glory. Sports stars and captains of industry are showered with gongs seemingly for doing their job, while so-called ordinary folk are given lesser baubles for selfless devotion to duty and tireless charity work. The whole system is class-bound, shrouded in secrecy and, critics argue, in dire need of reform. Now the government has pledged to do just that. There will be greater transparency and independent input, the cabinet office says. A review of the structure and membership of the committees which recommend honours is also promised. Two years ago, a secret review by Number 10 found the nine clandestine sub-committees that sift through the recommendations are predominantly made up of white, male civil servants over 50. The twice-yearly lists are still dominated by military figures and members of the civil service, the report found. The findings proved a bit too radical for the government, which kicked it into the long grass. It only came to light last month. \"A society should try to decide what kind of activities it wants to honour,\" says Labour MP Tony Wright, \"not just inherit a system that is full of inconsistencies and is based around class.\" Honours should be \"taken out of the hands of politicians\" and given to an independent committee, like in Australia, he says. But why have an honours system at all? Jamie Oliver got a gong\nCharles Mosley, editor-in-chief of Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, says the desire to recognise achievement - to set individuals above their peers - is part of human nature. \"It is one of the most basic human desires, along with sex and feeding your family and survival. If monkeys were better organised, they would have an honours system.\" Every country in the developed world has some kind of honours system: France its Legion of Honour and National Order of Merit; the US its Congressional Medal and Purple Heart. Even the former USSR had the Order of Lenin and Heroes of the Soviet Union. Honours perform an important function in society, helping to forge a sense of national identity and pride. Only the most churlish would begrudge the knighthood that will, inevitably, be bestowed on England rugby coach Clive Woodward, following his team's rugby World Cup triumph. Complex and opaque? The problem, critics argue, is that, in the UK, there are so many different grades of gratitude. No other country in the world has such a complex and opaque system. Some people receive the highest honours in the land for the flimsiest of reasons, while other more-deserving individuals are overlooked. Queen is \"fountain of honour\"\nBut she hands out awards on advice of ministers\nAbout 1,000 honours are on the PM's list each year\nOne in 123 diplomats gets an award, and one in 2,125 civil servants\nBut one in 15,500 teachers is honoured, and one in 20,000 nurses\nMany of the heroes of England's 1966 World Cup winning squad had to wait 34 years to receive any official recognition at all. Nobby Stiles, one of the members of the 1966 squad, says he was proud and honoured to receive an MBE from the Queen in 2000. \"It seemed a bit late but that was not the point. Times have changed,\" he told BBC News Online. Yet England captain Bobby Moore was given an OBE in 1967. \"It was said at the time that he was representing all of us. That is the way they said it.\" But did the rest of the team feel that way? \"I don't think so.\" Some have questioned whether sports stars and media figures should receive honours at all. \"Mr Blair seems to hand out honours to whoever is on television at the moment. More honours should be given to people who really deserve them.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:db625fa6-1d42-4207-ad0d-eb20ab3451ec>"]},{"passage":"By the end of 2015, hundreds of British D-Day veterans look set to receive the Legion d'Honneur, the highest honour that the French government can bestow. People looking for ex army jobs will be pleased to read this Western Morning News report on the news, featuring defence minister Mark Lancaster who told MPs that authorities in France are now prioritising cases involving veterans who are either approaching their 100th birthday or are seriously ill.\n\"To further assist the Legion authorities, we are resubmitting all cases where awards have not already been made at an agreed rate of 100 per week to avoid overtaxing the system,\" Mr Lancaster said, adding \"hurt and upset\" had in fact been caused by the months of delays that were seen because the Ministry of Defence had not anticipated the level of demand for the honour. It was thought that only a few hundred people would apply, but some 3,000 applications were received - and this number is on the increase all the time. The Legion of Honour was first established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte and is separated into five classifications - Chevalier, Officier, Commandeur, Grand Officier and Grand Croix. In order to be considered for the order, those in question need to demonstrate flawless performance in their line of work and go above and beyond what would typically be expected. The military distinctions are awarded for service or for extreme bravery. Last year, the French government told the Ministry of Defence it was keen to reward the acts of heroism displayed by veterans at the Normandy landings, while those involved in other campaigns to liberate France would also be considered eligible for the honour.comments powered by Disqus","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:127e9b53-42df-458c-b129-8fab2a005337>"]},{"passage":"PROMINENT public figures and everyday heroes are often honoured by Britain with an MBE, OBE or CBE. But no doubt many of us will not know the real meaning of the prestigious awards, handed out twice a year. Here’s all you need to know…\nWhat’s the difference between an MBE, OBE and CBE? The lucky recipients of the MBE, OBE and CBE are announced a few days before the end of the year and around the Queen’s state birthday, June 17, 2017. They recognise the contributions and achievements of people from all walks of life, from Hollywood stars to humble volunteers. The three most well-known awards represent different ranks in the Order of the British Empire. The highest ranking of the three is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), followed by OBE (Officer) and then the MBE (Member). Can women be knighted? There is no female equivalent to a knighthood as women are appointed to an order of chivalry. Women who are appointed to the Most Noble Order of the Garter or the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle are given the title of Lady rather than Dame – which is used instead of the male title Sir. What are MBEs, OBEs and CBEs awarded for? The honours were created in 1917 by King George V during the First World War as a way of rewarding civilians and servicemen in support positions for their contribution to the war effort. Now they are used to recognise an achievement or service to the community in any area, such as the arts, charity or education. According to the Cabinet Office, an MBE is given for an “outstanding achievement or service to the community. This will have had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others”. An OBE is awarded for having a “major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area”. A CBE is awarded for having a “prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area”. The New Year’s Honours themselves date back to 1890 – read our history of the awards to find out more. WHAT CAN PEOPLE GET HONOURS FOR? - Making a difference to their community or field of work\n- Enhancing Britain’s reputation\n- Long-term voluntary service\n- Innovation and entrepreneurship\n- Changing things, with an emphasis on achievement\n- Improving life for people less able to help themselves\n- Displaying moral courage\nWhat is the Order of the British Empire? The British honours system actually has several orders, mostly relating to the monarchy, military and colonial officials. But King George V wanted to fill the gap by creating an order which would honour normal people. However, the order has come under some criticism due to its connection with the now extinct British Empire. The Government has considered changing the name to the Order of British Excellence, but decided not to make any changes until after the order’s centenary in 2017. Is a CBE the same as a “Sir”? The CBE is the third highest of the order’s five ranks but only the top two can use title Sir, for a man, or Dame, for a woman. The second highest rank is a KBE or DBE – a Knight or Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The top rank in the Order is a GBE – a Knight or Dame Grand Cross – but these are only given out very rarely. Since 2000, just 16 have been awarded, all to men. But, confusingly, people can still become a Sir or a Dame without receiving a KBE or a GBE as they can be knighted separately. Sir Elton John, for example, has a CBE but has also been made a Knight Bachelor, along with other celebs such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Ian McKellen. Only Brits can be made a Knight Bachelor, but foreigners can be awarded an honorary KBE. What does an MBE, OBE or CBE entitle you to? Anyone selected for an honour will be invited to attend an “investiture” ceremony at a royal residence where the Queen, or sometimes Prince Charles, Prince William or Princess Anne, will award them with their insignia – a medal – of the order.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:345c190f-6017-4090-832a-af331a3206e3>"]},{"passage":"Structures of government\nFederal and provincial governments are elected through a representative democracy system. Areas of the country\/province are divided up equally and each area votes on a political representative. Elected officials need to have the most total votes of all candidates. Governments are formed based on which parties have the majority of representatives voted in. Municipal governments are not elected based on political parties, but rather through a group of independent candidates (councillors) who are led by a mayor. Voters in municipal elections in Alberta vote for their mayor and one or more councillors on regular 3-year intervals. The federal government is made up of the Parliament of Canada, which consists the House of Commons (the \"lower House\") and the Senate (the \"upper House\"). The House of Commons is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) from various political parties, while the Senate is made up of Senators appointed by the Prime Minister. The Governor General, Canada's representative of the Queen, oversees both houses. The House of Commons is the dominant branch of Parliament while both the Senate and the Governor General must approve proposed legislation. The Prime Minister is Canada's political leader. This position is not elected directly by the people. The leader the political party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Canada's Prime Minister. Decision making is mainly handled by the Cabinet of Canada, a committee chaired by the Prime Minister and made up of MPs from the political party that holds the majority of seats in the House of Commons. Parliament is located in Ottawa, Canada's capital city. The provincial government is similar in structure to the federal government. One major difference is the lack of a senate all provincial legislation is approved by the Lieutenant Governor, Alberta's representative of the Queen. Alberta's government is made up of the Legislative Assembly, with elected officials known as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The province's leader is known as the Premier. Like the federal Prime Minster, this position is awarded to the leader of the political party with the most seats in the Legislature. Key decisions are made by Alberta's cabinet, chaired by the Premier and comprised of MLAs from the political party with the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Alberta legislature is located in Edmonton, Alberta's capital city. Municipal governments lead local areas. They are led by a mayor and several independent councillors. Committees made up of small groups of councillors are often formed to focus on various municipal issues. These committees present their recommendations to the entire council, which then votes on proposed by-laws. Subscribe for information and resources relevant to you, delivered to your inbox.

Albertans raised a massive protest against government plans for private health care and private hospitals. Opposition to Bill 11 is remembered for the the spontaneous nightly vigils at the Legislature. The government passed an amended version of Bill 11 that actually inhibited private health care more than it facilitated it. Vote – 2001: Ralph Klein berated the homeless in a late night visit to a mens shelter in Edmonton. Long-known for his enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, Premier Ralph Klein’s late night visit to the Herb Jamieson Centre changed how many Albertans viewed the Premier’s vice. Klein publicly apologized and pledged to stop drinking. Vote – 2004: Ralph Klein declared fiscal debate erased, making Alberta the first debt free province in a decade. At his July 12 Stampede Breakfast, Premier Klein declared Alberta to be ‘debt-free.’ The pursuit of erasing the provincial debt became the defining goal of the government in the 1990s and early 2000s. As the Chief of Staff to the President of Daveberta said, “the language of our elections and our politics is shaped around deficits and spending in a way that isn’t present in other politics.”\nVote – 2005: Gay marriage becomes legal in Alberta. Alberta began granting marriage licences to same-sex couples on July 20, upon the granting of Royal Assent to the federal Civil Marriage Act. After promising to continue opposing same-sex marriage, Premier Klein announced Alberta would would reluctantly recognize same-sex marriage, but promised new legislative protection for anyone who opposed it on moral or religious grounds. Vote – 2006: Calgary MP Stephen Harper became Prime Minister of Canada. On January 23, Calgary-Southwest MP Stephen Harper led the Conservative Party to defeat the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Paul Martin to form the first Conservative government since 1988. As the first Prime Minister from Alberta since Joe Clark, Harper’s election shifted the power dynamic in Alberta politics, making it more difficult for the provincial government to criticize the boogeymen in Ottawa. Vote – 2006: $400 Ralphbucks cheques mailed to every Albertan. An embodiment of short-term vision of a government with unprecedented financial wealth, the $400 Prosperity Bonuses were mailed to every Albertan. This represented $1.4 billion (or 20%) of the $6.8 billion surplus and was criticized by many Albertans as a pointless giveaway (but few actually refused the cheques). Vote – 2006: Ralph Klein received 55.4% approval in the PC leadership review. After 14 years in the Premier’s office and leading the PC party to four majority governments, low approval from convention delegates forced an early retirement for the man who dominated and defined Alberta politics since 1992. Vote – 2006: Ed Stelmach defeated Jim Dinning in the PC leadership contest. On December 2, former Finance Minister and Calgary’s favourite son Jim Dinning was unexpectedly defeated by 13-year MLA and former Lamont County Reeve Ed Stelmach. Stelmach became Alberta’s first Premier from rural Alberta since Harry Strom in 1971. Vote – 2008: Linda Duncan defeated Rahim Jaffer to become the second-ever NDP MP from Alberta. On October 17, Linda Duncan was elected as MP for Edmonton-Strathcona, defeating four-term Conservative MP Rahim Jaffer by 436 votes. The first NDP MP elected in Alberta was Edmonton-East MP Ross Harvey in 1988. Vote – 2009: Danielle Smith was elected leader of the Wildrose Alliance. Recent polls have shown major short-term growth in Wildrose Alliance support since Danielle Smith was elected leader on October 17, but it may be too soon to tell what long-term effect she will have on Alberta’s political scene. Smith is a former Calgary Board of Education Trustee and Director of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e8ba49d7-f046-4227-bf15-568f7fe2f1de>"]},{"passage":"The British press, and thus the British political class, are all in a lather about the Honours system; as a result of a pair of leaks, there is decent chance that the system will be reformed.

MBEs are commonly given to long-serving postmen and church wardens and worthy folk who are not part of the ‘great and the good’; a CBE might be given to someone active in local politics, or to a popular actor or singer. The big awards, knighthoods, also come in various flavors and orders and ranks. For the Order of the Bath, these ranks are known to the cognoscenti as KG’s, KCMGs GCMG’s. While these really stand for Knight (Bachelor) of the Garter, Knight Commander and Knight Grand Cross of the Garter, the joke among the civil service – which gets the lion share of the elevated knighthoods – is that these stand for “Call me God,” “Kindly Call me God,” and “God Calls Me God”. Knighthoods (or, if the recipient is female, being named a Dame) differ from the lower honours in that after the recipient kneels before the Queen, they arise renamed. For example if Ms. Edna Average were to be made a Dame, she’d legally be Dame Edna, on her passport, credit cards, and so on, from then on. (In fact, there sort of is a Dame Edna[LINK], but that’s another story. There are also two special, separate honours called the Order of Merit (OM) which is limited to 24 living recipients at any time, and the Companion of Honour (CH), which are even higher than knighthoods, but don’t work a change on the name of the recipient. The OM is unusual among the major honours in that the Monarch actually selects them herself; almost all other honours other than those for members of the Royal Family, foreign Royals, and the Queen’s household are selected by the government although granted in the Queen’s name. It used to be that governments also handed out higher honours twice a year: peerages. Until a generation ago, peerages were inherited. Exactly what all the ranks are or were, I’ve never quite been sure I sorted out, but they included — in increasing order of precedence — Baronetcy, Baron, Viscount, Earl, Marquis, Duke. A Baronetcy is not a true peerage as it gives the inheritable right to be called ‘Sir Something’ but doesn’t carry with it the right to sit in the House of Lords. Like ordinary knights the holder has the right to vote, and can sit in the House of Commons if elected to it. True Peers of the Real, the Barons and up, lose their vote, and indeed lose their surnames, became Lord Something of Somewhere. Until recently all peers became life members of the House of Lords.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bc0b2a13-93ad-4ae7-9f6a-c64717a7143c>"]}]}

These include: excuse, mea culpa, or regret (used in plural form).","answer":"Certainly, expressing regret can be done with a variety of words that convey sincerity and remorse. Here are some alternatives to 'sorry' that you can use to express an apology:\n\n1. **Regret** - \"I regret my actions.\"\n2. **Apologies** - \"I apologize for my behavior.\"\n3. **Regretful** - \"I am regretful for what I've done.\"\n4. **Sorrowful** - \"I am sorrowful for my mistake.\"\n5. **Remorseful** - \"I am remorseful for my actions.\"\n6. **Contrite** - \"I am contrite for my part in this.\"\n7. **Sorry** - (while you mentioned wanting to avoid 'sorry,' it's a classic word for expressing regret, so it's worth including.)\n\nEach of these words can be used to express a sense of remorse and an acknowledgment of wrongdoing. The choice of word can depend on the severity of the mistake and the relationship you have with the person you're apologizing to. For instance, 'regret' might be more suitable for minor oversights, while 'remorseful' could be more appropriate for more significant errors. Remember, the tone and context in which you deliver the apology are just as important as the words themselves.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.\n\nI recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares! We all have high maintenance people in our lives.\n\n‘I’m sorry.’ The two simple yet powerful words couples might have difficulty saying at the right time. As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.\n\nHow To Apologize\nA look into apologies from a neurological intelligence perspective\nWhen I was a kid I did not understand apologies very well. One time at an art day camp I told someone that their artwork looked ugly. He was so upset that he snitched to the camp leader, who made me apologize. I said sorry, and the kid was still upset. They told me to \"Say it like I mean it\" whatever that meant, so I changed my voice to make it sound pitiful and regretful and said sorry again. They preferred the second apology to the first, even though I wasn't any more sorry the second time. I did not learn to apologize better from that exchange, but I did learn that people care a lot and can be very particular about how you apologize. They care because an apology has a purpose. I now know that apologies are supposed to initiate, or facilitate the healing of a broken relationship. If your apology doesn't do that, then others won't accept it. While other people have a very specific expectation of what your apology should look like, you might have different reasons for wanting to apologize. Usually people apologize after they realize that their actions affect themselves or after they realize how their actions affected others. For example, when I hurt the kid's feelings I could have apologized out of fear of the punishment the camp instructor might give me, or I could have apologized because I realized how much I had hurt the kid. The first motivation does not make for a good apology because people want to believe that you care about them. In addition to looking at good and bad apologies we will also be looking at the 5 different methods of apologizing. These methods were found by marriage councilor Gary Chapman. He calls them the languages of apology; they are: expressing regret, restitution, requesting forgiveness, not doing it again, and accepting responsibility. He found these different types of apologies by interviewing people, and asking them \"if you were to apologize to someone how would you do it? \", and \"if someone were to apologize to you how would you want them to do it?\" It turns out that these different types of apologies are rooted in the ethics of neurological intelligence. You can read more about these in my post titled Meta Ethics. As a quick recap the theory states that there are two systems of ethics. The first states that ethical behavior is motivated by preserving or enhancing your identity. This theory is where bad apologies come from. The second states that ethical behavior comes from building or preserving your relationships, this is where good apologies come from. Both systems of ethics have six different ethical principles which define them. The sixth relationship ethic states that you need to show people mercy; one way to do this is through apologizing for the ways that you failed the other ethics. Therefore the sixth ethic is not an apology method, but apologizing itself. Similarly the sixth identity ethic is not a method of making a poor apology, but instead the motivation for making a poor apology. Language 1: Don't Do it Again\nWhen you stop doing something that is wrong you are following the social contracts ethic. This ethic states that the only way to keep people from taking advantage of each other is to make mutually beneficial social contracts. When you stop doing harmful things you show that you are capable of creating and keeping social contracts again. The identity ethic that corresponds to this is the values ethic. It states that the things you believe are right are what is right. If you stop doing the things that you believe are wrong this might be good or bad, that depends on whether you were right or not. But it is not necessarily an apology. For it to be an apology it would have to actually be benefiting others with your change of behavior. Language 2: Restitution\nRestitution means that you try to correct the bad thing you have done. It comes from the common good ethic, which states that in order to reap the greatest benefit from group living you must contribute to the common good of society. When you make restitution you show that what you have done has placed an additional burden on someone, and the only way to make that up is to contribute to them. Sometimes restitution means that our undue the thing that you did wrong. If you steal, then you return it; if you break something, then you replace it. However there are some things that you cannot undo.\n\nKnowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.\n\nIn these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.\n\nRecently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the \"perfect apology\". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful \"sorry\". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations.

A sincere apology can produce positive health effects for the victim, including a reduction in anger-induced high blood pressure Influence of apologies and trait hostility on recovery from anger. Anderson, J.C., Linden, W., Habra, M.E. The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 2006; 29(4):347-58. . In the workplace, employees who receive effective apologies reported higher job satisfaction, less anger, and greater self-esteem When forgiving enhances psychological well-being: the role of interpersonal commitment. Karremans, J.C., Van Lange, P.A., Ouwerkerk, J.W., et al.\n\nRemorse, Regret and Perfect Apologies\nThe differences between remorse and regret are important, because the language, tone, content and approach we use for an apology should be appropriately tailored to the relevant action or consequence. Perhaps the most important distinction is between intentional (avoidable) and accidental (unavoidable; unintended) errors. Regrets for the consequences of a rational decision require perfect apologies that express compassion for the person who suffered the effects of the decision (e.g. cancelling the flight due to bad weather). Regrets typically focus on relatively minor adjustments to standard operating procedures and rarely produce major changes. On the other hand, expressing remorse and genuine sorrow for the pain caused by the wrong decisions we've made usually involves some form of internal change, personal improvement\/development or self-learning. It can be as innocuous as a case of buyer's remorse, which is a common phrase used to express guilt and shame at having bought something for the wrong reasons or that we couldn't afford, or something much more grave in nature. Remorse is driven by feelings of shame or humiliation and is far more personal in nature, often requiring apologies that include some promise or clear commitment to change something within us. These feelings, in other words, force us to question who we are and what our values are. They often lead to deep reflections about what we did and push us to re-evaluate our assumptions, preferences, and priorities because of the pain we've caused. It's very important to avoid mixing strategies and to take the time to craft an appropriate apology that addresses the right problem. The biggest mistake made by many compulsive apologizers is the tendency to apply remorse strategies for situations that call for expressions of sincere regret. As Miller explains:\nCompulsive apologizers sincerely mean their apologies, but they seldom have anything to apologize for except their accidental wrongs. They are truly remorseful. But such people devalue the worth of their apologies by apologizing so readily that their apologies become nervous tics. They find themselves apologizing for harms they did not commit or, in an especially extreme variant, apologizing to the person who harmed them. 1\nConsider, for example, the negative ripple effects of a correct decision to cancel a flight because of bad weather. The effects are often compounded by a series of follow-on actions and consequences that were more intentional and avoidable—for example, an angry and dismissive ticket agent responding to yet another angry customer demanding a seat on the next available flight out. The unintentional nature of the main problem, the cancelled flight, will always be secondary to the much larger sense of loss and pain suffered by the customer as a result of a smaller but intentional error related to the angry, dismissive ticket agent. The point is that in many business setting apologies to customers should be designed to pre-empt complaints by focusing on remorse rather than regret. Apologies for an inconvenience, while appropriate, may not be as effective as an apology that not only accepts responsibility but expresses both of these sentiments for the terrible experience the customers have been through. Acknowledging rather than dismissing these feelings and the anguish and time commitment of having to reschedule plans is essential for a perfect apology in these cases. Even if the consequences are completely out of the control of the company, and even if the decision was the right one, an apology that acknowledges the pain and accepts the need to deal with these issues will go a long way toward sustaining customer loyalty and satisfaction. Well crafted business apologies can create the impression that the company is truly remorseful and really cares about its customers and their continued patronage. This is often and most clearly expressed through compensation and restitution and is exactly what made, for example, the Disney's Customer Service policy on apologies and JetBlue's apology both so successful. The point is—when in doubt be remorseful, regardless of whether the mistake was serious or unavoidable. Erring on this side can never hurt, and the more serious errors occur when a mistake calls for an apology of remorse but expresses only regrets. This is a common trap that many of us fall into in both our business and personal lives. Learn about remorse and its role in forgiveness. Or, view our collection of quotes on remorse.\n\nIt would be impossible for the seven billion of us living on planet Earth not to tread on each other’s toes and rub each other up the wrong way from time to time. So, when it happens, how can we best deal with it in order to repair the situation? When to apologise (and when not to)\nFor some, “sorry” is the hardest word to say, while for others, the word spills from their lips with such frequency it appears to be their default response to anything that happens. If you’re in the latter category, I recommend you give some thought to why this is. What are you apologising for? Are you actually responsible for whatever has gone wrong? I’m thinking here of the times I’ve apologised for stuff that nobody could logically consider my fault, such as when my cousin came to visit me and it rained. Because as I was growing up I felt myself blamed for all sorts of things that were far outside my control, I continue to feel the impulse to seek forgiveness for practically any negative event that takes place around me. It’s an impulse I need to resist, for several reasons. An endless stream of apologies can be irritating, prompting the people on the receiving end to react in one of two ways: either they will feel obliged to keep reassuring the apologiser, when they might more usefully be concentrating on sorting out the problem, or they may buy into the grovelling and start berating the apologiser for whatever has transpired, whether or not it was her fault. Constant apologising can backfire and, in any case, the guilt and shame that accompany it are corrosive. However, this is not to say you should never apologise unless you have personally and deliberately done someone down. Not taking responsibility when the buck stops with you is even worse than assuming responsibility for events outside your control. It is the antithesis of leadership, integrity and courage – and it rarely fools anybody anyway. If I go into a busy restaurant, for example, where I have booked a table and the waiter says he has no record of my booking and there is no table available, I will feel far more mollified if he apologises and offers to make amends, rather than blaming the mistake on junior staff and shrugging it off. In some circumstances, it can take a lot of strength and confidence to apologise for an unintended consequence of something you’ve done, but in my experience it can be a healing and immensely helpful thing to do. What I have in mind here is the times my partner inadvertently upsets me. In some areas, I’m extremely sensitive and easily distressed and, when everything is fine, I accept I have to take responsibility for this and not force those around me to walk on eggshells. Once the wrong button has been pushed, though, I find it very hard not to react in childish ways, either crying and screaming in rage or withdrawing and hiding in fear. With most people, this behaviour tends simply to escalate the situation, as they feel threatened and defend themselves either by whinging (this is how it feels to me at the time) about how this isn’t their fault and I’m being unfair, or by attacking me back. I thank God that my man has the wisdom and strength to respond to me as the child I become in that state. He tells me calmly, gently and sincerely that he’s sorry for whatever it was he said or did that upset me. He puts his arms around me and we talk about it till it’s all over. He learns from each incident and never makes the same mistake twice, and gradually I’m learning too that I can trust him and need to deal with these things in a more grown-up way. How to apologise\nThe thing to remember when you’re apologising is that it’s for the other person’s benefit, not yours. If the purpose of your saying sorry is purely to elicit absolution from the wronged party, spare a thought in advance for how you may feel if absolution is not forthcoming. If your transgression has been serious, you may need to give the other person some time and space to process what has happened before you can expect a move towards forgiveness – but just because you don’t receive it immediately it doesn’t mean you will never get it. A meaningful apology, one that can repair the damage, obviously has to come from the heart.","passages":[{"passage":"One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2680b94a-483d-43fa-98fb-4a3dbf1ac6a3>"]},{"passage":"I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness.

It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares!

As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:da4d6207-49c9-46e9-b2a7-c82967c3af5b>"]},{"passage":"How To Apologize\nA look into apologies from a neurological intelligence perspective\nWhen I was a kid I did not understand apologies very well. One time at an art day camp I told someone that their artwork looked ugly. He was so upset that he snitched to the camp leader, who made me apologize. I said sorry, and the kid was still upset. They told me to \"Say it like I mean it\" whatever that meant, so I changed my voice to make it sound pitiful and regretful and said sorry again. They preferred the second apology to the first, even though I wasn't any more sorry the second time. I did not learn to apologize better from that exchange, but I did learn that people care a lot and can be very particular about how you apologize. They care because an apology has a purpose. I now know that apologies are supposed to initiate, or facilitate the healing of a broken relationship. If your apology doesn't do that, then others won't accept it. While other people have a very specific expectation of what your apology should look like, you might have different reasons for wanting to apologize. Usually people apologize after they realize that their actions affect themselves or after they realize how their actions affected others. For example, when I hurt the kid's feelings I could have apologized out of fear of the punishment the camp instructor might give me, or I could have apologized because I realized how much I had hurt the kid. The first motivation does not make for a good apology because people want to believe that you care about them. In addition to looking at good and bad apologies we will also be looking at the 5 different methods of apologizing. These methods were found by marriage councilor Gary Chapman. He calls them the languages of apology; they are: expressing regret, restitution, requesting forgiveness, not doing it again, and accepting responsibility. He found these different types of apologies by interviewing people, and asking them \"if you were to apologize to someone how would you do it? \", and \"if someone were to apologize to you how would you want them to do it?\" It turns out that these different types of apologies are rooted in the ethics of neurological intelligence. You can read more about these in my post titled Meta Ethics. As a quick recap the theory states that there are two systems of ethics. The first states that ethical behavior is motivated by preserving or enhancing your identity. This theory is where bad apologies come from. The second states that ethical behavior comes from building or preserving your relationships, this is where good apologies come from. Both systems of ethics have six different ethical principles which define them. The sixth relationship ethic states that you need to show people mercy; one way to do this is through apologizing for the ways that you failed the other ethics. Therefore the sixth ethic is not an apology method, but apologizing itself. Similarly the sixth identity ethic is not a method of making a poor apology, but instead the motivation for making a poor apology. Language 1: Don't Do it Again\nWhen you stop doing something that is wrong you are following the social contracts ethic. This ethic states that the only way to keep people from taking advantage of each other is to make mutually beneficial social contracts. When you stop doing harmful things you show that you are capable of creating and keeping social contracts again. The identity ethic that corresponds to this is the values ethic. It states that the things you believe are right are what is right. If you stop doing the things that you believe are wrong this might be good or bad, that depends on whether you were right or not. But it is not necessarily an apology. For it to be an apology it would have to actually be benefiting others with your change of behavior. Language 2: Restitution\nRestitution means that you try to correct the bad thing you have done. It comes from the common good ethic, which states that in order to reap the greatest benefit from group living you must contribute to the common good of society. When you make restitution you show that what you have done has placed an additional burden on someone, and the only way to make that up is to contribute to them. Sometimes restitution means that our undue the thing that you did wrong. If you steal, then you return it; if you break something, then you replace it. However there are some things that you cannot undo.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>"]},{"passage":"Knowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry.

You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>"]},{"passage":"Recently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the \"perfect apology\". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful \"sorry\". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations.

Perhaps the most important distinction is between intentional (avoidable) and accidental (unavoidable; unintended) errors. Regrets for the consequences of a rational decision require perfect apologies that express compassion for the person who suffered the effects of the decision (e.g. cancelling the flight due to bad weather). Regrets typically focus on relatively minor adjustments to standard operating procedures and rarely produce major changes. On the other hand, expressing remorse and genuine sorrow for the pain caused by the wrong decisions we've made usually involves some form of internal change, personal improvement\/development or self-learning. It can be as innocuous as a case of buyer's remorse, which is a common phrase used to express guilt and shame at having bought something for the wrong reasons or that we couldn't afford, or something much more grave in nature. Remorse is driven by feelings of shame or humiliation and is far more personal in nature, often requiring apologies that include some promise or clear commitment to change something within us. These feelings, in other words, force us to question who we are and what our values are. They often lead to deep reflections about what we did and push us to re-evaluate our assumptions, preferences, and priorities because of the pain we've caused. It's very important to avoid mixing strategies and to take the time to craft an appropriate apology that addresses the right problem. The biggest mistake made by many compulsive apologizers is the tendency to apply remorse strategies for situations that call for expressions of sincere regret. As Miller explains:\nCompulsive apologizers sincerely mean their apologies, but they seldom have anything to apologize for except their accidental wrongs. They are truly remorseful. But such people devalue the worth of their apologies by apologizing so readily that their apologies become nervous tics. They find themselves apologizing for harms they did not commit or, in an especially extreme variant, apologizing to the person who harmed them. 1\nConsider, for example, the negative ripple effects of a correct decision to cancel a flight because of bad weather. The effects are often compounded by a series of follow-on actions and consequences that were more intentional and avoidable—for example, an angry and dismissive ticket agent responding to yet another angry customer demanding a seat on the next available flight out. The unintentional nature of the main problem, the cancelled flight, will always be secondary to the much larger sense of loss and pain suffered by the customer as a result of a smaller but intentional error related to the angry, dismissive ticket agent. The point is that in many business setting apologies to customers should be designed to pre-empt complaints by focusing on remorse rather than regret. Apologies for an inconvenience, while appropriate, may not be as effective as an apology that not only accepts responsibility but expresses both of these sentiments for the terrible experience the customers have been through. Acknowledging rather than dismissing these feelings and the anguish and time commitment of having to reschedule plans is essential for a perfect apology in these cases. Even if the consequences are completely out of the control of the company, and even if the decision was the right one, an apology that acknowledges the pain and accepts the need to deal with these issues will go a long way toward sustaining customer loyalty and satisfaction. Well crafted business apologies can create the impression that the company is truly remorseful and really cares about its customers and their continued patronage. This is often and most clearly expressed through compensation and restitution and is exactly what made, for example, the Disney's Customer Service policy on apologies and JetBlue's apology both so successful. The point is—when in doubt be remorseful, regardless of whether the mistake was serious or unavoidable. Erring on this side can never hurt, and the more serious errors occur when a mistake calls for an apology of remorse but expresses only regrets. This is a common trap that many of us fall into in both our business and personal lives. Learn about remorse and its role in forgiveness. Or, view our collection of quotes on remorse.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d57498e2-c9a7-4ed0-952c-c2aa1f2c7b04>"]},{"passage":"It would be impossible for the seven billion of us living on planet Earth not to tread on each other’s toes and rub each other up the wrong way from time to time. So, when it happens, how can we best deal with it in order to repair the situation? When to apologise (and when not to)\nFor some, “sorry” is the hardest word to say, while for others, the word spills from their lips with such frequency it appears to be their default response to anything that happens. If you’re in the latter category, I recommend you give some thought to why this is. What are you apologising for? Are you actually responsible for whatever has gone wrong? I’m thinking here of the times I’ve apologised for stuff that nobody could logically consider my fault, such as when my cousin came to visit me and it rained. Because as I was growing up I felt myself blamed for all sorts of things that were far outside my control, I continue to feel the impulse to seek forgiveness for practically any negative event that takes place around me. It’s an impulse I need to resist, for several reasons. An endless stream of apologies can be irritating, prompting the people on the receiving end to react in one of two ways: either they will feel obliged to keep reassuring the apologiser, when they might more usefully be concentrating on sorting out the problem, or they may buy into the grovelling and start berating the apologiser for whatever has transpired, whether or not it was her fault. Constant apologising can backfire and, in any case, the guilt and shame that accompany it are corrosive. However, this is not to say you should never apologise unless you have personally and deliberately done someone down. Not taking responsibility when the buck stops with you is even worse than assuming responsibility for events outside your control. It is the antithesis of leadership, integrity and courage – and it rarely fools anybody anyway. If I go into a busy restaurant, for example, where I have booked a table and the waiter says he has no record of my booking and there is no table available, I will feel far more mollified if he apologises and offers to make amends, rather than blaming the mistake on junior staff and shrugging it off. In some circumstances, it can take a lot of strength and confidence to apologise for an unintended consequence of something you’ve done, but in my experience it can be a healing and immensely helpful thing to do. What I have in mind here is the times my partner inadvertently upsets me. In some areas, I’m extremely sensitive and easily distressed and, when everything is fine, I accept I have to take responsibility for this and not force those around me to walk on eggshells. Once the wrong button has been pushed, though, I find it very hard not to react in childish ways, either crying and screaming in rage or withdrawing and hiding in fear. With most people, this behaviour tends simply to escalate the situation, as they feel threatened and defend themselves either by whinging (this is how it feels to me at the time) about how this isn’t their fault and I’m being unfair, or by attacking me back. I thank God that my man has the wisdom and strength to respond to me as the child I become in that state. He tells me calmly, gently and sincerely that he’s sorry for whatever it was he said or did that upset me. He puts his arms around me and we talk about it till it’s all over. He learns from each incident and never makes the same mistake twice, and gradually I’m learning too that I can trust him and need to deal with these things in a more grown-up way. How to apologise\nThe thing to remember when you’re apologising is that it’s for the other person’s benefit, not yours. If the purpose of your saying sorry is purely to elicit absolution from the wronged party, spare a thought in advance for how you may feel if absolution is not forthcoming. If your transgression has been serious, you may need to give the other person some time and space to process what has happened before you can expect a move towards forgiveness – but just because you don’t receive it immediately it doesn’t mean you will never get it. A meaningful apology, one that can repair the damage, obviously has to come from the heart.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c095249a-c404-4d6e-b287-a37fdc17568f>"]}]}

Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes.

Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes.

However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water.

The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

Pre-Festival Street Fiesta, Free Sangria & Official After Party!No one parties like the Spanish and Valencia is the ideal summer party town with plenty of cafes, bars and clubs in the historic town centre.\n\nLa Tomatina is one of very few places – outside of American rom-coms – where public food fighting is not only allowed, but highly encouraged. Held annually in Bunol (roughly a 30-minute drive from Valencia), this saucy celebration offers participants just one glorious hour of red, pulpy, juicy, squishy and sticky fun. How to paint a town in tomato juice\nAt about 11am on August 27, 2014 (and on the last Wednesday of every August), La Tomatina explodes into Bunol with thousands of sticky visitors and flying tomatoes, and by the end of the frenzied hour, you can hardly tell the people and produce apart. It starts with the tradition where one of the punters has to climb a greasy pole and fetch a ham from the top – as soon as the ham is down, the pulpy carnage can begin. According to urban legend, it all started in the mid-1940s when a group of men wanted to partake in a local parade. Somewhat miffed, they protested by stealing tomatoes from a local stall and using them as weapons. A year later, the same thing happened, yet it wasn’t until the late 50s that the event became official. These days, Bunol’s 9,000 residents are overwhelmed by roughly 30,000 people surging in to the city. Pro tip: Book your accommodation well in advance or expect to stay in Valencia, as Bunol doesn’t have the capacity for such an influx. In fact, the festival used to attract as many as 50,000 people, but since 2013 it has been a ticketed event, capping the numbers to just 20,000 lucky tomato throwers. Tens of thousands of revellers surge through the tiny streets of Bunol, squashing, volleying and dodging approximately 117,934kg (that’s almost 2,000kg a minute!) of overripe tomatoes, according to the Huffington Post. Fire trucks come in afterwards to clean up the pooling mess on the streets, while it’s up to the soggy tomato throwers to clean off best they can either at the Bunol River, or back at their accommodation. Shopkeepers cover their storefronts in an attempt to protect their businesses from the ubiquitous tomato goo, the whole city celebrates for the week with music, parades, dancing and fireworks, and Bunol imports several trucks (or about 100 tonnes) of ripe tomatoes from Extremadura. While it may look like red chaos, there are a handful of rather important rules to keep in mind – as well as some expert advice. 1. You can’t rip shirts\n2. You have to squish the tomatoes prior to throwing them\n3. You can only throw tomatoes\n4. You must stop at the sound of the second cannon\n5. You are strongly – strongly – advised to wear goggles and gloves\n6. Wear closed shoes that you don’t care too much about – thongs will only slip off, and your clothes don’t stand much of a chance of recovering from the battle\n7. Bring waterproof covers for your cameras and phones, and keep keys in plastic bags under your clothes. The less you can bring with you the better, and just make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in case those pesky tomatoes do find their way into somewhere they shouldn’t be. Check out the options available from Virgin Travel Insurance to see if they suit your needs. Do think you’re a natural born food fighter?\n\nBy Rachael Funk\nWho hasn’t dreamed of being the first person to bellow “FOOD FIGHT!” and unleash a fury of flying food through uproarious crowds? Though most of us were probably well-behaved enough to resist starting such commotions in polite company, we don’t have to give up our food fight dreams just yet. Every year, festivals are held around the world with the sole purpose of slinging edible materials at each other and getting as messy as they possibly can. If you have unrealized fantasies about joining in a delicious riot, keep these in mind while you’re planning your next trip! La Tomatina • Buñol, Spain\nQuite possibly the world’s most famous food fight, La Tomatina is held on the last Wednesday of every August in the town of Buñol in Valencia. On the day of the event, trucks rumble into the center of town to drop off an abundance of tomatoes from the Extremadura region in western Spain. The original idea was that the festival would not begin until a determined volunteer climbed up a two-story tall, greased-up pole and retrieved a ham tied to the top. While hilarious, it ended up taking so long that they changed the start signal to the firing of water cannons. Once the cannons are blasted, the next hour is purely every man for himself. Once the fighting ends, fire trucks spray down the streets with water supplied by a Roman aqueduct. Conveniently, tomatoes are a natural disinfectant which leaves the town and the participants sparkly clean. La Tomatina is also celebrated in other places such as Sutamarchan, Colombia and Reno, Nevada.

It is customary to throw roasted soybeans while chanting “In with fortune! Out with evil!” to keep evil forces out of your home.

Battaglia delle Arance • Ivrea, Italy\nDoes three days of brutally flinging aging fruit at strangers appeal to you? In the northern town of Ivrea, the Battle of the Oranges is an annual event that commemorates the town’s victory over a 12th century tyrant (the origins are murky, so the exact century may vary by storyteller). Possibly the oldest-known organized food fight in Italy, the town will get together to reenact the battle. Today, the event has become a game, with players dressing in costumes as guards and commoners; the team of guards catapult their oranges from atop horse-drawn carriages and the nine teams of commoners return fire from the ground. Thousands of spectators and participants flood the streets to join the fun and first aid tents are set up around the piazzas to treat black eyes, bloody noses, and various injuries from slipping on the pulpy carnage.

This surreal 200-year old tradition includes participants dressing up in fake military garb and attack in the style of a fake uprising. Armed with eggs, flour, and (alarmingly) firecrackers, participants separate into groups for the battle; the Els Enfarinats and La Oposicio. The Els Enfarinats are said to declare and enforce ridiculous new laws throughout the day and even collect fines from those who break said laws while La Oposicio try to keep order. The entire day is spent acting out elaborate scenes of tyranny and oppression that builds into an eventual breaking point. The entire thing culminates in fierce combat in which the players pelt each other with eggs, flour, and (you guessed it) firecrackers.\n\nWe took the opportunity to make a listing of each of the Strange festivals taking place in Spain in.

La Vijanera is often a colourful masquerade celebrated on the 1st Sunday with the year from the small city of Silió, Cantabria. In the course of this conventional celebration, the locals costume as characters generally known as “zarramacos”. This extravagant gown is made of colourful furs, large cowbells and weevils hats. Every “zarramaco” has a particular purpose and collectively they tour the city of Silió hunting and banishing evil spirits. Just after studying the “coplas” – a humorous critique recalling the gatherings on the prior 12 months – comes the symbolic looking and killing on the bear. This ritual symbolises the triumph of fine around evil and is also thought to provide good luck for the coming calendar year. La Vijanera is a Competition with every little thing: enjoyment, superstition and lots of lifestyle. La Vijanera Pageant in SpainPhoto: La Vijanera Cultural Association Las Fallas– ValenciaThe festival of Las Fallas is further evidence that in Spain they truly know how to toss a celebration. Las Fallas is celebrated on a yearly basis in mid-March through the entire city of Valencia which is a street bash of humour, fire and gunpowder in the course of which massive, brightly coloured papier-mâché “ninots” or statues, are set ablaze. All year long, diverse organising committees Construct these statues from scratch, some of them measuring as many as metres high. The satirically themed ninots are placed all around the metropolis for folks to enjoy prior to They may be set alight and wrecked. Ninots of celebs, politicians and perhaps presidents are portrayed and burned all through this enjoyment fiesta, just one is saved by the votes of the individuals and transported on the Fallero Museum. You could find more specifics of Las Fallas in our information for the loudest fiesta of Valencia. Las Fallas in ValenciaInstagram Pageant of Santa Marta de Ribarteme – As Neves, PontevedraThe Competition of Santa Marta de Ribarteme is a very peculiar festival where by living survivors of around-death ordeals are carried from the streets in open up coffins. The relations on the survivors have the coffins to your church to point out gratitude to your Virgin Mary for shielding their family and friends throughout these scary ordeals. Santa Maria de Ribarteme is not the most standard of Spanish fiestas, though the soon after-bash lightens the mood with fireworks, Stay new music of various orchestras and very good meals. Pageant of Santa Marta de Ribarteme in As Neves, Pontevedra La Tomatina – Buñol, ValenciaLa Tomatina is the world’s biggest tomato combat and is celebrated on the last Wednesday of August. This pleasurable and refreshing festival normally takes position inside the town of Buñol in close proximity to Valencia. The tiny city of Buñol has just inhabitants but doubles in sizing over the well-known celebration, during which greater than plenty of overripe tomatoes are thrown at anything that moves. In around folks planned to engage in La Tomatina which pressured the Buñol community authorities To place a minimum rate tag to the celebration.\n\nSpain is full of amazing festivals, seemingly in every town, and Valencia’s famous Las Fallas, which begins tomorrow, ensures the Mediterranean city is known for more than just being a stopping off point for visitors to nearby La Tomatina each August. As a commemoration of Saint Joseph, hundreds of thousands–perhaps even millions–gather to enjoy fireworks, music, and burn huge paper sculptures. This practice is believed to help people start a fresh new year by burning bad thoughts and memories. Every neighborhood of Valencia has an organized group of people (the Casal faller) who host fundraising dinner parties featuring paella throughout the year, and use the money to construct a massive sculpture (falla) that will eventually be burnt in the festival. The falla is constructed according to an agreed-upon theme, which is typically a satirical shot at anything or anyone who draws the attention of the falleros. Recent editions have included George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and even Shrek. These are all entered into a contest, and must be completed by March 15th to avoid facing disqualification. From there, they are placed in their respective (albeit temporary) homes during a ceremony called La Planta (the rising), where they remain until being burned. Some of the larger fallas…\nMore grand fallas…\n(image credit: Times of Malta)\n(image credit: Times of Malta)\nThe Main Event(s)\nThe event itself is a 5-day extravaganza, featuring a multitude of historical, religions and comedic processions. Each day begins sharply at 8am with La Despertà or, wake up call, which features brass bands marching down the street playing loud music. Close behind them are the fallers throwing large firecrackers (indeed once you’ve been here, you will no longer be surprised to hear explosions even in the middle of the night, or kids seemingly as small as babies throwing pyrotechnics). Later in the day, at exactly 2pm, comes La Mascletà, an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays (the term “las fallas” actually means “the fires” in Valencian, so this shouldn’t come as a surprise). During this, pyrotechnicians are competing for the honor of providing the final Mascletà of the festival on the night of March 19th, also known as La Nit del Foc (“The Night of Fire”). Besides these two regularly scheduled events, the days of Las Fallas are full of a variety of offerings—bullfights, parades, paella contests and even beauty pageants—and stalls everywhere selling fried goodies like pores, xurros, buyols and roasted chestnuts. Each night of the festival features a fireworks display, with each day progressively becoming grander until the main event on the 19th. A typical Mascelta crowd for Las Fallas in Valencia\nOn the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19, the falles are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as la cremà (the burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called falles (“torches”). Traditionally, the falla in the Plaça de l’Ajuntament is burned last. By this point, the whole city is like a dance party, except that instead of music there is the explosive sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. This, of course, leads to the occasional building being burned, though firefighers have adopted some clever tricks to in recent years to minimize this risk. History of Las Fallas\nLike most of Spain’s events, the history of Las Fallas is widely disputed, although popular belief suggests that it started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of broken artifacts and the wooden lanterns that lit the streets to celebrate the spring equinox. This also coincided with the church’s festival of Saint Joseph, who was the patron saint of carpenters. From there, smaller characters started being created from the wood, which evolved into the grand statues that are seen today when polystyrene and soft cork made it possible to produce falles over 30 meters tall. The event has become so huge that a significant part of the local economy is devoted to it, and an entire suburban area has taken on the name of City of Falles due to the excessive amount of artisans, sculptors, painters and others who spend months producing the fallas here.\n\nExpect a burst of piquant flavours in your mouth when you try the local cheese, sprinkled with paprika or served with figs. Some stalls also sell wines, which can be excellently paired with the cheese – a complete meal, bound to satisfy your palate. You can also learn the local art of crafting cheese from sheep or goat milk – a perfect recipe for you to try a hand at making delicious cheese back home. Stonehenge Summer Solstice, England\nIt’s the first day of summer and you can experience it right from the most ancient wonder of the world – Stonehenge. How this peculiar pattern of stones came to exist has been a mystery since ages! People from all around the world, especially druids, gather here to celebrate the shortest night of the year and watch the summer solstice. It’s certainly a kind of ethereal magic to watch the darkness dissolve into daylight as the first rays of the sun hit the huge circle of stones with beautiful precision. In fact, the pattern of the rays channelled on the stones is so perfect that it’s eerie how it was built with such symmetry in the bronze age – a world without science! We hope that the Outlander fans can guess it for the rest of us. Tomorrowland, Boom, Belgium\nTomorrowland – A dreamland that strums soul-stirring music thrumming in sync with your heartbeats, bound to send you into an inner jamming zone! With concerts going on all across the venue in the town of Boom, this festival is graced by the likes of David Guetta or Afrojack, making it one hell of a party. Enter this fantasy land in Tomorrowland’s private shuttles, and you’ll see gigantic artsy trolls or fairytale castles, taken straight from a Tim Burton movie set. Dancing to fast beats with glow lights in your hand in this strange setup is a thrilling experience indeed! La Tomatina, Buñol, Spain\nLove yourself a good food fight? Then the La Tomatina festival in Buñol is right up your alley! It’s said that the people of this town once bombarded the city councilmen with tomatoes, and since then the tradition evolved into a festival. During this day, Buñol attracts travellers from all across the world, their eyes shining with juvenile glee as they look at the huge trucks full of tomatoes entering the city. You start the affair by scrambling to grab a piece of ham from a greasy pole! Once this is done, there is a blast from a water cannon, and La Tomatina begins. The trucks empty their squishy load, and then it’s one mad hour of plonking tomatoes that lead to the messiest food fight on the streets. At the end of this fun spectacle, you’re half tomato soup, with a childish smile on your face. Note: We advise you to be careful when you participate and follow all the rules of the festival to play a safe game. Festes De La Merce, Barcelona, Spain\nA 4-day street festival, La Merce is Barcelona’s creative innovation given a dazzling life! Picture fire-breathing dragons slither through the city, the streets alight with a thousand different sparklers. Behold the giant’s parade, where gargantuan statues of Kings and Queens are displayed in all their glory. All this, held in honour of the Lady of Mercy, believed to have once saved the city from a plague. From Saint Petersburg and Stockholm to Buenos Aires, guest cities are also invited to portray their unique arts and traditions – perhaps the most fascinating feature of this festival. After all, while we celebrate our own cultures with huge pomp, it’s always interesting to know more about the other civilizations around the world. Oktoberfest, Munich, Germany\nA wedding party held for Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in Germany quickly turned into an annual bash we now call as Oktoberfest! Every year, the people of Munich and from across the world descend on a meadow outside the city with one motto – Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit (a toast to good times). Throughout a two week celebration, you will see colourful tents strung up and the streets filled with people parading to kettle drums, where the floats are full of brimming kegs of beer. Grab a mug of ale in one hand, and a giant pretzel in the other to join in this folksy fun!\n\nEver have that dream where you're in a centuries-old town centre with a bunch of new friends when suddenly a giant food fight breaks out and you start to throw tomatoes at anyone and everyone? Well now's your opportunity to live it out loud. Seriously, this is one weird and wonderful experience you've got to see to believe. La Tomatina is one of the world's most unusual festivals in which people gather in the town square of Buñol to pelt each other with squashed tomatoes while trying to grab a leg of ham from the top of a greased pole.

For the time poor, this guide represents a cross-section of the continent’s most popular gatherings. Music, film, art, theatre – taste some of it, taste all of it. Carnevale di Venezia, Venice, Italy\nWhen: Yearly from mid January to the start of Lent\nThe Carnival of Venice began circa 1162 AD and has run almost every year since, save for a two-century hiatus that began in the Napoleonic era and ended in 1979. It’s a slow-burner of an event, beginning between January and February and ending at the beginning of Lent, forty days before Easter. The carnival opens at St Mark’s Square to exuberant fanfare: you’ve got dress-up contests, musical and theatrical performances, balls, and feasts. The carnival celebrations are probably most famously punctuated by the elaborate white masks you’ll see everyone wearing. Mardi Gras is the world’s derivation of Carnival di Venezia, and shares the original spirit of frivolity and exaltation of culture for culture’s own sake. La Tomatina, Spain\nWhen: 30 August\nThe immortal (and, depending on who you ask, unverified) tale of La Tomatina’s inception is nonetheless close to its present-day reality. Back in 1945, a group of young people at the Los Gigantes Carnaval in Bunol started throwing tomatoes at each other; unsurprisingly, the participants and onlookers loved the novelty, and it became an institution. Spain made it an official annual fixture in 1957, and now, you can join the battle. It happens on 30 August this year so book your flights accordingly. Cannes International Film Festival, France\nWhen: 17 to 28 May\nEvery year a near-tangible buzz overwhelms the bucolic streets and alleyways of Cannes, as the who’s-who of the international film industry fly into the Cote d’Azur to celebrate the film festival of film festivals. While much of the Cannes Film Festival is locked down tight, the public can participate in select screenings and huddle beside press photo-stops in hopes of seeing world-famous celebrities in the flesh. Anyone who’s been we’ll tell you the magic of Cannes Film Festival has little to do with the films, or even the coveted Palme d’Or; the place becomes an effervescent hub of comingling cultures. Eat at a restaurant by the beach, catch a screening under the stars at Cine ma de la Plage; whatever you do, your very existence will justify the festival’s purpose. When:16 September to 3 October\nDon’t like beer? No matter. Oktoberfest is a people festival, a social gathering elevated by song, dance, and brilliantly hearty food. The event is a convivial, open-air, open-plan affair held on the Theresienwiese, which is the official space set aside for the festivities. Munich is a boisterous place during Oktoberfest: you’ll go on rides, wave at männer und frauen passing by your table on gigantic stein-shaped floats, and listen to traditional German music performed live. Whatever you do, make sure you spring for a litre-sized stein and toast your fellow human in singular style. Cooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, England\nWhen: 29 May 2017\nDuring what may be Europe’s most bizarrely entertaining festival, the citizens of Gloucester – plus whoever else is fortunate enough to be present – roll a seven-pound wheel of cheese down a series of hills varying in steepness. Participants in their hundreds compete to catch the cheese before it reaches the bottom of the hill. That’s it, and it’s been that way for around two centuries. Injuries are common, but as local reports detail, they’re commonly hilarious. Be one of the thousands who flock in hopes of seeing a victor capture the cheese; or, if you’re well-insured and game, consider contending yourself.","passages":[{"passage":"« Next Article: Carnival in Tenerife\nPrevious Article: Bull runs in Spain »\nWednesday, March 07, 2012 (read 11298 times)\nLa Tomatina Spanish Festivalby Jose\nBuñol is Spanish town famous for a world renowned tomato fight festival known as “La Tomatina”. Valencia, on the east coast of Spain, is a sunny Mediterranean city famous for its long sandy beaches and delicious oranges. Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes. The curious thing, however, is that the small town’s notoriety does not stem from the quality of its tomatoes but rather their interesting custom of “bathing” in it. Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes. The tomatoes are specially grown for the festival and are said to not be of food grade quality. When the last Wednesday of August arrives, shopkeepers and other business owners with establishments near the main square cover their windows and doors in preparation for the messy tomato event. The next step in La Tomatina festival is the arrival of the large trucks that slowly make their way up the cobblestone streets of Buñol filled with squishy ripe tomatoes on route to the town square where masses of people are awaiting the official start of the festival. However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water. The result is actually a pristine shine to the cobblestone streets which are disinfected and thoroughly cleansed due to the acidity of the tomato sauce. The Buñol Tomatina festival is an event worth witnessing and participating in at least once in your lifetime. However, we recommend that you plan ahead, the small town only offers so much accommodation and the hotels in all the surrounding areas quickly fill up as the event draws near.

The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

Held annually in Bunol (roughly a 30-minute drive from Valencia), this saucy celebration offers participants just one glorious hour of red, pulpy, juicy, squishy and sticky fun. How to paint a town in tomato juice\nAt about 11am on August 27, 2014 (and on the last Wednesday of every August), La Tomatina explodes into Bunol with thousands of sticky visitors and flying tomatoes, and by the end of the frenzied hour, you can hardly tell the people and produce apart. It starts with the tradition where one of the punters has to climb a greasy pole and fetch a ham from the top – as soon as the ham is down, the pulpy carnage can begin. According to urban legend, it all started in the mid-1940s when a group of men wanted to partake in a local parade. Somewhat miffed, they protested by stealing tomatoes from a local stall and using them as weapons. A year later, the same thing happened, yet it wasn’t until the late 50s that the event became official. These days, Bunol’s 9,000 residents are overwhelmed by roughly 30,000 people surging in to the city. Pro tip: Book your accommodation well in advance or expect to stay in Valencia, as Bunol doesn’t have the capacity for such an influx. In fact, the festival used to attract as many as 50,000 people, but since 2013 it has been a ticketed event, capping the numbers to just 20,000 lucky tomato throwers. Tens of thousands of revellers surge through the tiny streets of Bunol, squashing, volleying and dodging approximately 117,934kg (that’s almost 2,000kg a minute!) of overripe tomatoes, according to the Huffington Post. Fire trucks come in afterwards to clean up the pooling mess on the streets, while it’s up to the soggy tomato throwers to clean off best they can either at the Bunol River, or back at their accommodation. Shopkeepers cover their storefronts in an attempt to protect their businesses from the ubiquitous tomato goo, the whole city celebrates for the week with music, parades, dancing and fireworks, and Bunol imports several trucks (or about 100 tonnes) of ripe tomatoes from Extremadura. While it may look like red chaos, there are a handful of rather important rules to keep in mind – as well as some expert advice. 1. You can’t rip shirts\n2. You have to squish the tomatoes prior to throwing them\n3. You can only throw tomatoes\n4. You must stop at the sound of the second cannon\n5. You are strongly – strongly – advised to wear goggles and gloves\n6. Wear closed shoes that you don’t care too much about – thongs will only slip off, and your clothes don’t stand much of a chance of recovering from the battle\n7. Bring waterproof covers for your cameras and phones, and keep keys in plastic bags under your clothes. The less you can bring with you the better, and just make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in case those pesky tomatoes do find their way into somewhere they shouldn’t be. Check out the options available from Virgin Travel Insurance to see if they suit your needs.

Though most of us were probably well-behaved enough to resist starting such commotions in polite company, we don’t have to give up our food fight dreams just yet. Every year, festivals are held around the world with the sole purpose of slinging edible materials at each other and getting as messy as they possibly can. If you have unrealized fantasies about joining in a delicious riot, keep these in mind while you’re planning your next trip! La Tomatina • Buñol, Spain\nQuite possibly the world’s most famous food fight, La Tomatina is held on the last Wednesday of every August in the town of Buñol in Valencia. On the day of the event, trucks rumble into the center of town to drop off an abundance of tomatoes from the Extremadura region in western Spain. The original idea was that the festival would not begin until a determined volunteer climbed up a two-story tall, greased-up pole and retrieved a ham tied to the top. While hilarious, it ended up taking so long that they changed the start signal to the firing of water cannons. Once the cannons are blasted, the next hour is purely every man for himself. Once the fighting ends, fire trucks spray down the streets with water supplied by a Roman aqueduct. Conveniently, tomatoes are a natural disinfectant which leaves the town and the participants sparkly clean. La Tomatina is also celebrated in other places such as Sutamarchan, Colombia and Reno, Nevada.

It is customary to throw roasted soybeans while chanting “In with fortune! Out with evil!” to keep evil forces out of your home. This can be celebrated at home or you can attend public Setsubun events at temples all over Japan, where celebrities are designated as bean throwers. To maximize your good fortune after tossing the beans, eat a roasted soybean for each year of your life, then one more for good health. Battaglia delle Arance • Ivrea, Italy\nDoes three days of brutally flinging aging fruit at strangers appeal to you? In the northern town of Ivrea, the Battle of the Oranges is an annual event that commemorates the town’s victory over a 12th century tyrant (the origins are murky, so the exact century may vary by storyteller). Possibly the oldest-known organized food fight in Italy, the town will get together to reenact the battle. Today, the event has become a game, with players dressing in costumes as guards and commoners; the team of guards catapult their oranges from atop horse-drawn carriages and the nine teams of commoners return fire from the ground. Thousands of spectators and participants flood the streets to join the fun and first aid tents are set up around the piazzas to treat black eyes, bloody noses, and various injuries from slipping on the pulpy carnage. Photo posted by Instagram user @observadoruy\nEls Enfarinats • Ibi, Spain\nOn December 28 of each year, residents of Ibi take to the streets to celebrate the Day of Innocents. This surreal 200-year old tradition includes participants dressing up in fake military garb and attack in the style of a fake uprising. Armed with eggs, flour, and (alarmingly) firecrackers, participants separate into groups for the battle; the Els Enfarinats and La Oposicio. The Els Enfarinats are said to declare and enforce ridiculous new laws throughout the day and even collect fines from those who break said laws while La Oposicio try to keep order. The entire day is spent acting out elaborate scenes of tyranny and oppression that builds into an eventual breaking point. The entire thing culminates in fierce combat in which the players pelt each other with eggs, flour, and (you guessed it) firecrackers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a0b0eb89-0e96-489d-822b-9a7aa0687430>"]},{"passage":"We took the opportunity to make a listing of each of the Strange festivals taking place in Spain in.

As a commemoration of Saint Joseph, hundreds of thousands–perhaps even millions–gather to enjoy fireworks, music, and burn huge paper sculptures. This practice is believed to help people start a fresh new year by burning bad thoughts and memories. Every neighborhood of Valencia has an organized group of people (the Casal faller) who host fundraising dinner parties featuring paella throughout the year, and use the money to construct a massive sculpture (falla) that will eventually be burnt in the festival. The falla is constructed according to an agreed-upon theme, which is typically a satirical shot at anything or anyone who draws the attention of the falleros. Recent editions have included George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and even Shrek. These are all entered into a contest, and must be completed by March 15th to avoid facing disqualification. From there, they are placed in their respective (albeit temporary) homes during a ceremony called La Planta (the rising), where they remain until being burned. Some of the larger fallas…\nMore grand fallas…\n(image credit: Times of Malta)\n(image credit: Times of Malta)\nThe Main Event(s)\nThe event itself is a 5-day extravaganza, featuring a multitude of historical, religions and comedic processions. Each day begins sharply at 8am with La Despertà or, wake up call, which features brass bands marching down the street playing loud music. Close behind them are the fallers throwing large firecrackers (indeed once you’ve been here, you will no longer be surprised to hear explosions even in the middle of the night, or kids seemingly as small as babies throwing pyrotechnics). Later in the day, at exactly 2pm, comes La Mascletà, an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays (the term “las fallas” actually means “the fires” in Valencian, so this shouldn’t come as a surprise). During this, pyrotechnicians are competing for the honor of providing the final Mascletà of the festival on the night of March 19th, also known as La Nit del Foc (“The Night of Fire”). Besides these two regularly scheduled events, the days of Las Fallas are full of a variety of offerings—bullfights, parades, paella contests and even beauty pageants—and stalls everywhere selling fried goodies like pores, xurros, buyols and roasted chestnuts. Each night of the festival features a fireworks display, with each day progressively becoming grander until the main event on the 19th. A typical Mascelta crowd for Las Fallas in Valencia\nOn the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19, the falles are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as la cremà (the burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called falles (“torches”). Traditionally, the falla in the Plaça de l’Ajuntament is burned last. By this point, the whole city is like a dance party, except that instead of music there is the explosive sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. This, of course, leads to the occasional building being burned, though firefighers have adopted some clever tricks to in recent years to minimize this risk. History of Las Fallas\nLike most of Spain’s events, the history of Las Fallas is widely disputed, although popular belief suggests that it started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of broken artifacts and the wooden lanterns that lit the streets to celebrate the spring equinox. This also coincided with the church’s festival of Saint Joseph, who was the patron saint of carpenters. From there, smaller characters started being created from the wood, which evolved into the grand statues that are seen today when polystyrene and soft cork made it possible to produce falles over 30 meters tall. The event has become so huge that a significant part of the local economy is devoted to it, and an entire suburban area has taken on the name of City of Falles due to the excessive amount of artisans, sculptors, painters and others who spend months producing the fallas here.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a194c82-e65e-4c79-899b-25b33dd188c0>"]},{"passage":"Expect a burst of piquant flavours in your mouth when you try the local cheese, sprinkled with paprika or served with figs.

Stonehenge Summer Solstice, England\nIt’s the first day of summer and you can experience it right from the most ancient wonder of the world – Stonehenge. How this peculiar pattern of stones came to exist has been a mystery since ages! People from all around the world, especially druids, gather here to celebrate the shortest night of the year and watch the summer solstice. It’s certainly a kind of ethereal magic to watch the darkness dissolve into daylight as the first rays of the sun hit the huge circle of stones with beautiful precision. In fact, the pattern of the rays channelled on the stones is so perfect that it’s eerie how it was built with such symmetry in the bronze age – a world without science!

Then the La Tomatina festival in Buñol is right up your alley! It’s said that the people of this town once bombarded the city councilmen with tomatoes, and since then the tradition evolved into a festival. During this day, Buñol attracts travellers from all across the world, their eyes shining with juvenile glee as they look at the huge trucks full of tomatoes entering the city. You start the affair by scrambling to grab a piece of ham from a greasy pole! Once this is done, there is a blast from a water cannon, and La Tomatina begins. The trucks empty their squishy load, and then it’s one mad hour of plonking tomatoes that lead to the messiest food fight on the streets. At the end of this fun spectacle, you’re half tomato soup, with a childish smile on your face.

Carnevale di Venezia, Venice, Italy\nWhen: Yearly from mid January to the start of Lent\nThe Carnival of Venice began circa 1162 AD and has run almost every year since, save for a two-century hiatus that began in the Napoleonic era and ended in 1979. It’s a slow-burner of an event, beginning between January and February and ending at the beginning of Lent, forty days before Easter. The carnival opens at St Mark’s Square to exuberant fanfare: you’ve got dress-up contests, musical and theatrical performances, balls, and feasts. The carnival celebrations are probably most famously punctuated by the elaborate white masks you’ll see everyone wearing. Mardi Gras is the world’s derivation of Carnival di Venezia, and shares the original spirit of frivolity and exaltation of culture for culture’s own sake. La Tomatina, Spain\nWhen: 30 August\nThe immortal (and, depending on who you ask, unverified) tale of La Tomatina’s inception is nonetheless close to its present-day reality. Back in 1945, a group of young people at the Los Gigantes Carnaval in Bunol started throwing tomatoes at each other; unsurprisingly, the participants and onlookers loved the novelty, and it became an institution. Spain made it an official annual fixture in 1957, and now, you can join the battle. It happens on 30 August this year so book your flights accordingly. Cannes International Film Festival, France\nWhen: 17 to 28 May\nEvery year a near-tangible buzz overwhelms the bucolic streets and alleyways of Cannes, as the who’s-who of the international film industry fly into the Cote d’Azur to celebrate the film festival of film festivals. While much of the Cannes Film Festival is locked down tight, the public can participate in select screenings and huddle beside press photo-stops in hopes of seeing world-famous celebrities in the flesh. Anyone who’s been we’ll tell you the magic of Cannes Film Festival has little to do with the films, or even the coveted Palme d’Or; the place becomes an effervescent hub of comingling cultures. Eat at a restaurant by the beach, catch a screening under the stars at Cine ma de la Plage; whatever you do, your very existence will justify the festival’s purpose. When:16 September to 3 October\nDon’t like beer? No matter. Oktoberfest is a people festival, a social gathering elevated by song, dance, and brilliantly hearty food. The event is a convivial, open-air, open-plan affair held on the Theresienwiese, which is the official space set aside for the festivities. Munich is a boisterous place during Oktoberfest: you’ll go on rides, wave at männer und frauen passing by your table on gigantic stein-shaped floats, and listen to traditional German music performed live. Whatever you do, make sure you spring for a litre-sized stein and toast your fellow human in singular style. Cooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, England\nWhen: 29 May 2017\nDuring what may be Europe’s most bizarrely entertaining festival, the citizens of Gloucester – plus whoever else is fortunate enough to be present – roll a seven-pound wheel of cheese down a series of hills varying in steepness. Participants in their hundreds compete to catch the cheese before it reaches the bottom of the hill. That’s it, and it’s been that way for around two centuries. Injuries are common, but as local reports detail, they’re commonly hilarious.

Science Education, 98(6), 937–962. doi:10.1002\/sce.21132\nResearchers Maltese, Melki, and Wiebke investigated when lasting interest in STEM is sparked and how it is maintained by comparing the remembrances of adults who did and did not persist in STEM. Both groups said that they became interested in STEM early, usually by Grade 6. Those who persisted in STEM were more likely than those who did not to say that they had always been interested in STEM. Parents and teachers were early influences for those who stayed in STEM fields. Van Schijndel, T. J. P., Franse, R. K., & Raijmakers, M. E. J. (2010). The Exploratory Behavior Scale: Assessing young visitors’ hands-on behavior in science museums. Science Education, 94, 794–809. The authors of this paper were interested in knowing how parents can support exploratory behaviors of their preschool-aged children at museum exhibits. They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

Bateson 1999 Journal of Environmental Education v. 31 n. 1, p. 27-32\nThis statistical study from the Journal of Environmental Education identifies the relationship between students' attitude toward science and their attitude toward the environment. Canadian 9th grade students answered attitude question sets about the environment and about science in general. The strongest correlation identified was that students who had a positive attitude toward science also had a positive attitude toward the environment. Another correlation indicated that while students favored preservation of natural resources, they did not favor a reduction in freedom for logging companies, farmers, automobile drivers, and so on.\n\nThemes in Science and Technology Education 1(1), 7-36\nMatthews, Philip.

The essence of this range of approaches is that the information is analysed in a way that permits patterns to emerge from within the data itself - ie based on the responses of the informants - rather than being imposed in advance, perhaps incorrectly or simplistically, by the researcher. The study of two or more effects (“dependent variables”) at one time. – A measure of how many people or things in a group were studied by the researcher; followed by an equal sign and a numeral. This refers to analysis of a sample (in this context, a protein) by more than one independent method of analysis. For example, a classical 2-D gel provides two independent, orthogonal parameters, pI and apparent size. MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called \"multivariate\". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable\nAny of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables. Carrying out multivariate analysis in this research means we could isolate the effect of design on business performance from other factors. See the Detailed research methodology for more information.

R&D tax credits for SMEs Research and development (R&D) tax credits are a form of company tax relief which can either reduce a companyâ€(tm)s tax bill or, for some small or medium-sized companies, provide a cash sum. The aim of the tax credits is to encourage greater R&D spending in order to promote investment in innovation. See the HM Customs and Revenue website for more details. the simultaneous study of two or more measures, often involving a relationship with a dependent (outcome) measure. Analysis utilising more than one variable in combination, for example maintaining the wind and pressure fields in balance (Section 8.2.3). The analysis of more than two variables simultaneously, for the purpose of determining the relationship among them. a statistical analysis that involves more than one dependent variable. analysis involving multiple independent or dependent variables. The analysis of relationships between several variables â€“ e.g. factor analysis. is performed when datasets are composed of vector observations. These can consist of observations of different variables at one location or gridpoint values for a particular time sequence. Different multivariate data analysis techniques are used in climate research (see CCA, EOF, SVD, PCA, etc.).\n\nIn order for applicants to work for the state department, they must take a test in the language of the country where they plan to work.

The sample included adults aged between 18 and Ethics approval was obtained from the university board before recruitment began. We selected for a geographically diverse sample within the Midwest of the US through an initial screening survey. The primary outcome measures were the levels of religiosity and trust in science. Religiosity refers to involvement and belief in religious traditions, while trust in science represents confidence in scientists and scientific research outcomes. The secondary outcome measures were gender and parental education levels of participants and whether these characteristics predicted religiosity levels. Religiosity was measured using the Centrality of Religiosity scale Huber, The Likert scale is made up of 15 questions with five subscales of ideology, experience, intellect, public practice, and private practice. The internal consistency of the instrument is. Trust in Science. Four Likert scale items were assessed on a scale from 1 completely distrust to 5 completely trust. Potential participants were invited to participate in the survey online using Qualtrics www. The survey consisted of multiple choice questions regarding demographic characteristics, the Centrality of Religiosity scale, an unrelated filler anagram task, and finally the General Trust in Science index. The filler task was included to avoid priming or demand characteristics, and an attention check was embedded within the religiosity scale. For full instructions and details of tasks, see supplementary materials. For this correlational study , we assessed our primary hypothesis of a relationship between religiosity and trust in science using Pearson moment correlation coefficient. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficient was assessed using a t test. To test our secondary hypothesis of parental education levels and gender as predictors of religiosity, multiple linear regression analysis was used.

The independent variable, also known as the manipulated variable, is the factor manipulated by the researcher, and it produces one or more results, known as dependent variables home research. The dependent variable is what is affected by the independent variable-- your effects or outcomes for example, if you are studying the effects of a new educational program on student achievement, the program is the independent variable and your measures of achievement are the dependent ones.

Method of Research Used\nThe design employed by the researcher in order to carry out the purpose of the study was the descriptive and historical method. The descriptive method was used to produce more information about “what is\/ are “or the current prevailing perceptions of students regarding the topic. On the other hand, the historical method was also used. The researchers gathered the average grade of the 40 respondents for school years 2007-2010. Sources of Data\nThe respondents of the study were the students of the high school department of St. Scholastica’s Academy- Marikina. The student respondents were from the Year IV who was enrolled for the past 3-4 years up to the present school year 2010-2011 but random sampling was used. Using the simple random technique, the researchers gathered 40 senior respondents from different sections. The simple random sampling was used for this allowed the researcher to have a known probability that each elementary unit to be chosen. Data Gathering Instruments\nThe study used the following research instruments in gathering the needed data. Questionnaire. A one-page questionnaire was designed for the study. It was composed of 17 questions that aimed to satisfy the statement of the problem. The required time to complete the questionnaire was estimated to be 10 minutes. Unstructured Interview. The interview refers to a face-to-face encounter between two persons, the interviewer who asks the questions and the interviewee who gives her opinion and answer relevant to satisfy the proposed study. The questions used in the questionnaire and unstructured interview were formulated by the researcher and have gone through the validation process of their English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad. Data Gathering Procedure\nThe researcher sought the permission and approval of the English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad to conduct the study. When the permission and approval were granted, the questionnaire was formulated. The first draft was presented to the person above and their classmates for comments and suggestions. After which the final questions were written in black and white, photocopied and distributed to the respondents. Statistical Treatment of Data\nThe statistical techniques used in treating the data were the following: Weighted Mean. The weighted means of the responses to the questionnaire were taken. The weighted mean is used whenever the composite attitude of a group of respondents toward an issue is sought. The weighted mean is attained by multiplying the scale value of the responses indicating it and the dividing the total weighted points by the number of responses. Percentage. The percentage was used to interpret data from frequency distribution. Arithmetic Mean. The arithmetic mean was used in some items of the questionnaire. The formula is: M = Ex\nPRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA\nThis chapter presents, analyzes, and interprets the data gathered from the 40 copies of a one-page survey questionnaire distributed to fourth year students of SSAM batch 2010-2011 which includes 17 questions that would help the researchers answer the questions of the proposed study. The age of the 40 students who answered the questionnaire ranges from 15-16 years old. Eighteen students were studying in SSAM for 11 years, four students were at the said school for 10 years, two for nine years in this institution, one for six years, eight for four years, five for three years, one for two years and one student did not answer the question. The researchers asked the respondents if they experienced failing a subject during their stay in the said institution and out of the 40 respondents, a total of 20 students or 50% of them experienced failing a subject since first year high school and the other 20 students or 50% did not experience failing any subject. Table 1 presents the number of students who experienced failing a subject from first year high school to third year high school.","passages":[{"passage":"Stem Friends: Friendships and STEM interest\nDiscovering the role that 4th and 5th-grade friendships have to play in children’s STEM interest\nMost parents understand that their child’s friendships hold great influence on their perceptions, hobbies, and interests – but today, our Data Scientist, David Meier, provides us with some interesting evidence that demonstrates how your children’s friends feel about STEM may greatly impact your own child’s STEM interest! Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier.

Science Education, 98(6), 937–962. doi:10.1002\/sce.21132\nResearchers Maltese, Melki, and Wiebke investigated when lasting interest in STEM is sparked and how it is maintained by comparing the remembrances of adults who did and did not persist in STEM. Both groups said that they became interested in STEM early, usually by Grade 6. Those who persisted in STEM were more likely than those who did not to say that they had always been interested in STEM. Parents and teachers were early influences for those who stayed in STEM fields. Van Schijndel, T. J. P., Franse, R. K., & Raijmakers, M. E. J. (2010). The Exploratory Behavior Scale: Assessing young visitors’ hands-on behavior in science museums. Science Education, 94, 794–809. The authors of this paper were interested in knowing how parents can support exploratory behaviors of their preschool-aged children at museum exhibits. They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

Method of Research Used\nThe design employed by the researcher in order to carry out the purpose of the study was the descriptive and historical method. The descriptive method was used to produce more information about “what is\/ are “or the current prevailing perceptions of students regarding the topic. On the other hand, the historical method was also used. The researchers gathered the average grade of the 40 respondents for school years 2007-2010. Sources of Data\nThe respondents of the study were the students of the high school department of St. Scholastica’s Academy- Marikina. The student respondents were from the Year IV who was enrolled for the past 3-4 years up to the present school year 2010-2011 but random sampling was used. Using the simple random technique, the researchers gathered 40 senior respondents from different sections. The simple random sampling was used for this allowed the researcher to have a known probability that each elementary unit to be chosen. Data Gathering Instruments\nThe study used the following research instruments in gathering the needed data. Questionnaire. A one-page questionnaire was designed for the study. It was composed of 17 questions that aimed to satisfy the statement of the problem. The required time to complete the questionnaire was estimated to be 10 minutes. Unstructured Interview. The interview refers to a face-to-face encounter between two persons, the interviewer who asks the questions and the interviewee who gives her opinion and answer relevant to satisfy the proposed study. The questions used in the questionnaire and unstructured interview were formulated by the researcher and have gone through the validation process of their English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad. Data Gathering Procedure\nThe researcher sought the permission and approval of the English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad to conduct the study. When the permission and approval were granted, the questionnaire was formulated. The first draft was presented to the person above and their classmates for comments and suggestions. After which the final questions were written in black and white, photocopied and distributed to the respondents. Statistical Treatment of Data\nThe statistical techniques used in treating the data were the following: Weighted Mean. The weighted means of the responses to the questionnaire were taken. The weighted mean is used whenever the composite attitude of a group of respondents toward an issue is sought. The weighted mean is attained by multiplying the scale value of the responses indicating it and the dividing the total weighted points by the number of responses. Percentage.

The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption.\nThe phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF).\nThe project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina.\nLight signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination.

To achieve storage, light signals would need to be slowed down so they can be buffered within a small area, which could be accomplished by exploiting 'fast and slow' light effects. The long-term goal is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude while dramatically lowering energy consumption compared to current electronic systems.","answer":"Optical computing systems based on 'fast and slow' light have the potential to significantly enhance data storage capabilities compared to current electronic storage methods. This is due to several key advantages:\n\n1. **Higher Density**: Optical systems can store data in a much smaller space. By manipulating light to store information, researchers have been able to achieve densities that far exceed those of traditional electronic storage. For example, techniques like holography can store data volumetrically, using the entire volume of the storage medium rather than just its surface.\n\n2. **Longer Storage Times**: Optical storage methods, particularly those using phenomena like 'fast and slow' light, can potentially store data for much longer periods without degradation. This is because the information is stored in the properties of light itself, which is less susceptible to the types of degradation that affect electronic storage over time.\n\n3. **Faster Access Times**: Accessing data stored optically can be significantly faster than accessing data stored electronically. Light travels much faster than electrons, allowing for quicker read and write times.\n\n4. **Lower Energy Consumption**: Optical storage methods can be more energy-efficient. Since they rely on light rather than electrical currents, they can reduce the amount of heat generated, which in turn can lower energy consumption and potentially increase the lifespan of the storage media.\n\n5. **Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference**: Optical storage is not affected by electromagnetic interference, which can be a significant issue for electronic storage, especially in environments with a lot of electronic equipment.\n\n6. **Scalability**: Optical computing systems can be scaled up more easily than electronic systems, allowing for the creation of storage systems that can handle vast amounts of data.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the theoretical advantages of optical computing systems are compelling, practical implementation faces several challenges. These include the difficulty of manipulating light in the same way that electrons can be manipulated, the need for highly precise and stable optical components, and the technological hurdles associated with integrating optical systems with existing electronic infrastructure. Despite these challenges, ongoing research into 'fast and slow' light and other optical storage techniques continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, potentially leading to a future where optical storage methods surpass current electronic storage capabilities in terms of density, speed, and energy efficiency.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second.

Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.\n\nResearchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it. The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nScientists \"freeze\" light inside a crystal for one minute\nResearchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it.

The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nScientists from the University of Oxford have developed a tiny nanoscale device that can be programmed using either photons or electrons. This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nMobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months. This problem will have to be overcome by a new quantum\ncomputing–based solution, wherein the dependence is on quantum\n7 Computing Paradigms\n1.10 Optical Computing\nOptical computing system uses the photons in visible light or infrared beams, rather than electric current, to perform digital computations. An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and\/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1. Why is it necessary to understand the various computing paradigms? 2. Compare grid computing with electric power grid\n3. Will mobile computing play a dominant role in the future? Discuss 4. How are distributed computing and network computing different or\n5. How may nanocomputing shape future devices? Ditto, W. L., A. Miliotis, K. Murali, and S. Sinha. The chaos computing paradigm. Cloud Computing Fundamentals\nThe objectives of this chapter are to\n• Understand the basic ideas and motivation for cloud computing • To define cloud computing\n• Understand the 5-4-3 principles of cloud computing and cloud ecosystem\n• Understand the working of a cloud application\n• Have a brief understanding on the benefits and drawbacks in cloud computing\n2.1 Motivation for Cloud Computing\nLet us review the scenario of computing prior to the announcement and availability of cloud computing: The users who are in need of computing are expected to invest money on computing resources such as hardware, software, networking, and storage; this investment naturally costs a bulk currency to the users as they have to buy these computing resources, keep these in their premises, and maintain and make it operational—all these tasks would add cost.\n\nOne of the consequences of our increased use of broadband is a big increase in the amount the data that we store outside our homes and businesses. The numbers are becoming staggering. There are currently about 3.7 billion people using the Internet, and together we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of online data every day. The trends are that by 2025 we’ll be storing 160 zettabytes of data per year – a zettabyte is one trillion gigabytes. I store a lot more data online than I used to. I now store things in the cloud all day long. When I edit a Word or Excel file, my changes are all stored in the cloud. I also back up every change on my computer every day. I write and store these blogs on a WordPress server. Copies of my blogs are automatically posted and stored on Twitter and LinkedIn. My company’s accounting records are stored online. When my car pulls into a driveway, it uploads diagnostics into the cloud. Pictures I take on my cellphone are automatically saved. I have no idea what else is being shared and saved by apps and software that I routinely use. As recently as a few years ago, I had very little interaction with the cloud, but I now seemingly live and work in the cloud. It may be hard to believe, but in the foreseeable future, we’ll be facing a data storage crisis. We can’t afford the resources to be able to store data in the same way we do today. Data centers now use nearly 20% of the electricity used by technology. A single data center uses more electricity than a small town. We’re consuming electric generation resources and spinning off huge amounts of carbon dioxide to be able to save the 45 pictures taken at the birthday party you attended last night. One of the obvious solutions to the data storage challenge is to throw away data. But who gets to decide what gets kept? The alternative is to find better methods of data storage that don’t require as much energy or take as much space. There are several areas of research into better storage – none is yet ready for prime time, but the ideas are intriguing. 5D Optical Storage. Researchers at the University of Southampton are exploring data storage using lasers to etch into cubes of silicon glass. The technique is being called 5F, because in addition to using the normal three axes as storage parameters they are also using the size of a recorded record and the orientation. Think of this as a 3D version of the way we used to store data on compact disks. This technology would be used for long-term storage since something that is etched into the glass is permanent. Storing data in glass requires no power, and the glass cubes are nearly indestructible. One small cube could store hundreds of terabytes of data. Researchers at the University of Manchester are taking a different approach and looking at the benefits of storing data at super-cold temperatures. They have developed man-made molecules that can store several hundred times more data than in the equivalent space on current hard drives. The key is to store the molecules at low temperatures. This is the same research group that discovered graphene and that works with unique molecular structures. Scientists have known that storage at lower temperatures can work, and the big breakthrough is having this technology work at 80 Kelvin using liquid nitrogen (which is significantly warmer than past work near to absolute zero using liquid helium). Since our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen the frozen gas is inexpensive to produce. Scientists are hoping that the molecules will be able to store data for a long time, even if losing power. DNA Storage. Scientists have been intrigued for over a decade about using DNA as a storage medium. DNA could be an idea storage media because it’s made from our base-pair amino acids, and the convoluted coiled structure provides a lot of storage capacity in a condensed space. A team at Harvard was able to store the code for a video on a strand of bacterial DNA. Since then, the commercial company Catalog has been working to perfect the technology. The company believes it is close to a breakthrough by using a synthetic version of a DNA molecule rather than living tissue. Data could be written to the molecule as it’s being assembled. Like with etched glass, this is permanent storage and highly promising. In the past summer, the company announced it was able to record the full 16 Gigabytes of Wikipedia into a tiny vial of the material. We need these technologies and others to work if we don’t want to drown in our own data.\n\nThe growing demands of high definition digital video content, fixed content data, and compliance and security application will soon outstrip the capabilities of current storage technologies to keep up the demand. Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD\n1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3. These discs have the capacity to hold up to 3.9 terabyte (TB) of information, which is approximately 6,000 times the capacity of a CDROM, 830 times the capacity of a DVD, 160 times the capacity of single-layer Blu-ray-Discs, and about 48 times the capacity of standard computer hard drives. 4. The HVD also has a transfer rate of 1 gigabit\/s. 5. While reading a page the entire page of data can be retrieved quickly and at one time .\n\nELECTRONIC IMAGING & STORAGE GUIDE\nScanners are becoming smaller, cheaper, faster and more functional\nhe first step in most imaging applications is to capture text, graphics and photos so that they can be stored for easy reference. Electronic scanners do this by using light to \"read\" images off paper documents, microfilm or photographic film. Ordinary scanners take pictures of images for archival applications in which images are stored for reference only. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) devices are used to recognize shapes and characters from predefined fields and convert them into digital computer code, so that text can be manipulated once it is scanned. Until recently, many government imaging projects involved high-end color scanners capable of processing more than 100 pages a minute and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. These large flatbed units, from companies such as Sharp and Xerox, are used in sophisticated defense and intelligence applications, or to tackle high-volume paperwork such as tax forms or medical records. But now agencies are turning to scanners for smaller jobs as well. Inexpensive desktop and handheld models are being used to store correspondence and other simple tasks. Sheet-fed units, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Microtek, can be as small as a PC mouse and cost as little as $200. Data capture has become so popular that Compaq and Hewlett-Packard recently introduced computers with scanners built into the keyboards. Increased competition in the scanners market has resulted in less expensive and more sophisticated machines. Time- and money-saving features once considered optional are now standard on many models. Duplex scanning, which enables images on both sides of documents to be captured at the same time, is rapidly replacing simplex scanning. Other features such as automatic feeders, color dropout options and super-high resolutions also are turning up on medium-range and low-end machines. Higher resolutions, however, require more scanning time per page and more storage capacity. Scanning speeds on lower-resolution units are up to about 150 pages a minute, with an average recognition accuracy of 95 percent. Some models have built-in spell checkers and word-analysis programs to ease the cleanup job when characters are misread. Many OCR devices use \"fuzzy logic\" to decipher mispelled words.\n\nThe data storage capacity has consistently been a significant concern, since the invention of computers and different computing devices. As computers got further developed, data size expanded accordingly making a never-ending interest for expanded storage limits. Data storage devices have advanced radically from being enormous trunks with the ability to hold a couple of kilobytes of data, to microchips ready to hold a couple of gigabytes of data. We have always tried to find simplistic ways to save the information, right from the first storage device, which was invented by Fritz Pfluemer “Magnetic Storage, 1928” till today which is cloud storage. We have invented simple, easy and accessible storage devices which are more accustomed based on today’s and futuristic needs. But, the revolution in storage devices started from 1971 with the invention of ‘floppy’ which was developed by IBM. At that time floppy was considered to be a least expensive storage device geared towards loading microcode into the system\/370 mainframes. It was a portable device made up of magnetic film encased in plastic, made it easier and faster to store data. Invention of the floppy disk revolutionized the portable factor of storage disk which had not been seen in earlier storage devices. As time went on, there was a need to store more data in one disk itself to ease the life of the people and CD-ROMs helped serve this need. The acronym ROM – Read-Only Memory, meant that without writing or erasing data can be read . This was progressive, in light of the fact that other than computer data, audio files could be put away and played utilizing a CD player. Albums contain up to 680 MB of storage space and can store programming and game consoles. In contrast to floppies and CDs, USB drives can store, erase and reprogram data. USBs a.k.a thumb drives or pen drives are actually the size of a human thumb. Try not to let their little size nitwit you as they can store data anyplace between 8GB to 256 GB at low expenses. USBs basically should be associated with a USB port in a work area or a PC. Like USBs are External portable hard drives that hold up to 1 Terabyte of data and work like a USB. Cloud Computing was a revolution in the data age. The whole idea of storage was repurposed by erasing the requirement for dynamic administration by the user. The user can distantly get to data that is available on “clouds” that have a place with either similar association or various associations. The requirement for finding a storage space that is virtual and available from anyplace prompted the improvement of cloud storage. The measures of data and data we use or trade have developed exponentially and have called for propels in data storage. For more than 50 years, scientists have tried different things with different techniques to locate an ideal storage arrangement. With such a great amount of data to be put away today, we can just envision its expansion in the coming years. In the years to come, we can anticipate more progressive storage gadgets; far unbelievable what we are utilized to today. As we have seen a developing trend in terms of digital storage which revolutionized the computing and storage capacities of the devices. Right from the invention of the storage devices it has always been dependent on various components such as, storage space, price per MB of storage, performance, etc. If we look at the trend in physical size of the storage devices, we can clearly see that right from the invention of the first storage device it has been reduced to such an extent that it is portable and easy to operate and handle. The first floppy which was introduced was of 8-inch which was then cropped up into 3.5 inches in 1981. The storage capacity of the floppy disk was 218.8 kb which was then developed into CD-ROM with an increased storage capacity of 700MB. CD-ROM was developed in such a way that it can be used in cd players and in computers too. The storage device further developed into USB (universal serial bus), which was much smaller in size as compared with the previous storage devices and was having a greater amount of data storage capacity. The cost of these devices varied according to their time of use. If we compare them to the scale of cost per mb of data storage, it is much easier to say that with the revolution in devices there is a cheaper amount of data per mb of storage within these devices. There is also a revolution in the performance of these devices, USB storage devices are much better than a CD-ROM and floppy because at a cheaper price and in a small size it can perform better and is portable as compared to other devices.","passages":[{"passage":"European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ce1a9862-3acc-47fe-a46f-5d9cba25c524>"]},{"passage":"Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ac456a32-9360-4961-be4b-8baafe289cc6>"]},{"passage":"Researchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it.

However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates.

This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:84cc7973-2b66-4130-8e98-d69e2e42381b>"]},{"passage":"Mobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months.

An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and\/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1.

The numbers are becoming staggering. There are currently about 3.7 billion people using the Internet, and together we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of online data every day. The trends are that by 2025 we’ll be storing 160 zettabytes of data per year – a zettabyte is one trillion gigabytes. I store a lot more data online than I used to. I now store things in the cloud all day long. When I edit a Word or Excel file, my changes are all stored in the cloud. I also back up every change on my computer every day. I write and store these blogs on a WordPress server. Copies of my blogs are automatically posted and stored on Twitter and LinkedIn. My company’s accounting records are stored online. When my car pulls into a driveway, it uploads diagnostics into the cloud. Pictures I take on my cellphone are automatically saved. I have no idea what else is being shared and saved by apps and software that I routinely use. As recently as a few years ago, I had very little interaction with the cloud, but I now seemingly live and work in the cloud. It may be hard to believe, but in the foreseeable future, we’ll be facing a data storage crisis. We can’t afford the resources to be able to store data in the same way we do today. Data centers now use nearly 20% of the electricity used by technology. A single data center uses more electricity than a small town. We’re consuming electric generation resources and spinning off huge amounts of carbon dioxide to be able to save the 45 pictures taken at the birthday party you attended last night. One of the obvious solutions to the data storage challenge is to throw away data. But who gets to decide what gets kept? The alternative is to find better methods of data storage that don’t require as much energy or take as much space. There are several areas of research into better storage – none is yet ready for prime time, but the ideas are intriguing. 5D Optical Storage. Researchers at the University of Southampton are exploring data storage using lasers to etch into cubes of silicon glass. The technique is being called 5F, because in addition to using the normal three axes as storage parameters they are also using the size of a recorded record and the orientation. Think of this as a 3D version of the way we used to store data on compact disks. This technology would be used for long-term storage since something that is etched into the glass is permanent. Storing data in glass requires no power, and the glass cubes are nearly indestructible. One small cube could store hundreds of terabytes of data. Researchers at the University of Manchester are taking a different approach and looking at the benefits of storing data at super-cold temperatures. They have developed man-made molecules that can store several hundred times more data than in the equivalent space on current hard drives. The key is to store the molecules at low temperatures. This is the same research group that discovered graphene and that works with unique molecular structures. Scientists have known that storage at lower temperatures can work, and the big breakthrough is having this technology work at 80 Kelvin using liquid nitrogen (which is significantly warmer than past work near to absolute zero using liquid helium). Since our atmosphere is mostly nitrogen the frozen gas is inexpensive to produce. Scientists are hoping that the molecules will be able to store data for a long time, even if losing power. DNA Storage. Scientists have been intrigued for over a decade about using DNA as a storage medium. DNA could be an idea storage media because it’s made from our base-pair amino acids, and the convoluted coiled structure provides a lot of storage capacity in a condensed space. A team at Harvard was able to store the code for a video on a strand of bacterial DNA. Since then, the commercial company Catalog has been working to perfect the technology. The company believes it is close to a breakthrough by using a synthetic version of a DNA molecule rather than living tissue. Data could be written to the molecule as it’s being assembled. Like with etched glass, this is permanent storage and highly promising. In the past summer, the company announced it was able to record the full 16 Gigabytes of Wikipedia into a tiny vial of the material. We need these technologies and others to work if we don’t want to drown in our own data.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d3b7a70c-4021-4f5a-afd0-83cba1772ac9>"]},{"passage":"The growing demands of high definition digital video content, fixed content data, and compliance and security application will soon outstrip the capabilities of current storage technologies to keep up the demand.

The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store.

Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage.

Electronic scanners do this by using light to \"read\" images off paper documents, microfilm or photographic film. Ordinary scanners take pictures of images for archival applications in which images are stored for reference only. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) devices are used to recognize shapes and characters from predefined fields and convert them into digital computer code, so that text can be manipulated once it is scanned. Until recently, many government imaging projects involved high-end color scanners capable of processing more than 100 pages a minute and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. These large flatbed units, from companies such as Sharp and Xerox, are used in sophisticated defense and intelligence applications, or to tackle high-volume paperwork such as tax forms or medical records. But now agencies are turning to scanners for smaller jobs as well. Inexpensive desktop and handheld models are being used to store correspondence and other simple tasks. Sheet-fed units, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Microtek, can be as small as a PC mouse and cost as little as $200. Data capture has become so popular that Compaq and Hewlett-Packard recently introduced computers with scanners built into the keyboards. Increased competition in the scanners market has resulted in less expensive and more sophisticated machines. Time- and money-saving features once considered optional are now standard on many models. Duplex scanning, which enables images on both sides of documents to be captured at the same time, is rapidly replacing simplex scanning. Other features such as automatic feeders, color dropout options and super-high resolutions also are turning up on medium-range and low-end machines. Higher resolutions, however, require more scanning time per page and more storage capacity. Scanning speeds on lower-resolution units are up to about 150 pages a minute, with an average recognition accuracy of 95 percent. Some models have built-in spell checkers and word-analysis programs to ease the cleanup job when characters are misread.

As computers got further developed, data size expanded accordingly making a never-ending interest for expanded storage limits. Data storage devices have advanced radically from being enormous trunks with the ability to hold a couple of kilobytes of data, to microchips ready to hold a couple of gigabytes of data. We have always tried to find simplistic ways to save the information, right from the first storage device, which was invented by Fritz Pfluemer “Magnetic Storage, 1928” till today which is cloud storage. We have invented simple, easy and accessible storage devices which are more accustomed based on today’s and futuristic needs. But, the revolution in storage devices started from 1971 with the invention of ‘floppy’ which was developed by IBM. At that time floppy was considered to be a least expensive storage device geared towards loading microcode into the system\/370 mainframes. It was a portable device made up of magnetic film encased in plastic, made it easier and faster to store data. Invention of the floppy disk revolutionized the portable factor of storage disk which had not been seen in earlier storage devices. As time went on, there was a need to store more data in one disk itself to ease the life of the people and CD-ROMs helped serve this need. The acronym ROM – Read-Only Memory, meant that without writing or erasing data can be read . This was progressive, in light of the fact that other than computer data, audio files could be put away and played utilizing a CD player. Albums contain up to 680 MB of storage space and can store programming and game consoles. In contrast to floppies and CDs, USB drives can store, erase and reprogram data. USBs a.k.a thumb drives or pen drives are actually the size of a human thumb. Try not to let their little size nitwit you as they can store data anyplace between 8GB to 256 GB at low expenses. USBs basically should be associated with a USB port in a work area or a PC. Like USBs are External portable hard drives that hold up to 1 Terabyte of data and work like a USB. Cloud Computing was a revolution in the data age. The whole idea of storage was repurposed by erasing the requirement for dynamic administration by the user. The user can distantly get to data that is available on “clouds” that have a place with either similar association or various associations. The requirement for finding a storage space that is virtual and available from anyplace prompted the improvement of cloud storage. The measures of data and data we use or trade have developed exponentially and have called for propels in data storage. For more than 50 years, scientists have tried different things with different techniques to locate an ideal storage arrangement. With such a great amount of data to be put away today, we can just envision its expansion in the coming years. In the years to come, we can anticipate more progressive storage gadgets; far unbelievable what we are utilized to today. As we have seen a developing trend in terms of digital storage which revolutionized the computing and storage capacities of the devices. Right from the invention of the storage devices it has always been dependent on various components such as, storage space, price per MB of storage, performance, etc. If we look at the trend in physical size of the storage devices, we can clearly see that right from the invention of the first storage device it has been reduced to such an extent that it is portable and easy to operate and handle. The first floppy which was introduced was of 8-inch which was then cropped up into 3.5 inches in 1981. The storage capacity of the floppy disk was 218.8 kb which was then developed into CD-ROM with an increased storage capacity of 700MB. CD-ROM was developed in such a way that it can be used in cd players and in computers too. The storage device further developed into USB (universal serial bus), which was much smaller in size as compared with the previous storage devices and was having a greater amount of data storage capacity. The cost of these devices varied according to their time of use. If we compare them to the scale of cost per mb of data storage, it is much easier to say that with the revolution in devices there is a cheaper amount of data per mb of storage within these devices. There is also a revolution in the performance of these devices, USB storage devices are much better than a CD-ROM and floppy because at a cheaper price and in a small size it can perform better and is portable as compared to other devices.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:eb7cf295-c14a-4846-ad45-fb08984316fb>"]}]}

There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne\n“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large. They find themselves born into a certain place in society, and they accept what each day brings forth, without any effort of thought beyond what the immediate present requires…they seek the satisfaction of the needs of the moment, without much forethought, and without considering that by sufficient effort the whole condition of their lives could be changed…It is only a few rare and exceptional men who have that kind of love toward mankind at large that makes them unable to endure patiently the general mass of evil and suffering, regardless of any relation it may have to their own lives. These few, driven by sympathetic pain, will seek, first in thought and then in action, for some way…\nView original post 32 more words\n…it will be well to consider…what is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\n“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself. I’ve worked hard at being the hero of my own life. But every time I checked the register of displaced persons, I was still on it. I didn’t know how to belong. Longing? Yes. Belonging? No.”\nJeanette Winterson Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?\nPhoto- A Artway","question_category":"Opinion","question_category_desc":"A question asking for a subjective viewpoint","user_category":"Layman","user_category_desc":"A user with little to no specialized knowledge in the subject, seeking simple, clear, and easy-to-understand explanations","question":"What makes philosophy valuable even though it doesn't give us definite answers?\n","gold":"The value of philosophy lies largely in its uncertainty.

Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: \"123 wise phrases to reflect on life\"\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.\n\n- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning. It is the method wherein specific ideas and conclusions are derived from general statements and hypotheses. - Metaphysics is the branch or type of philosophy that focuses on finding answers to questions about nature, reality, and the physical universe. - Axiology is the type or branch of philosophy that studies fundamental values and principles. - Epistemology is the branch or type of philosophy that scrutinizes how we, people, are able to learn and understand what we know. Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.\n\nWhy Study Philosophy?Page address: https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/philosophy\/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill. Philosophy in the Job Market\n- Chicago Business Journal - The Sword of Damocles: The Value of Philosophy to a Business Leader\n- The Wall Street Journal - Why I Was Wrong About Liberal Arts Majors\n- The New York Times - In a New Generation of College Students, Many Opt for the Life Examined\n- Huffington Post - The Unexpected Way Philosophy Majors Are Changing The World Of Business\n- The Atlantic Monthly - The Management Myth\n- Why Study Philosophy - Philosophy: What can it do for you?\n\nBut without a fair, accurate, and intelligible representation of those viewpoints, students will be at a disadvantage in criticizing viewpoints they find objectionable. Taking a responsible critical stance towards a viewpoint requires attitudes of benign skepticism and an openness to being puzzled. A prominent pedagogical model in higher academia is that of active rather than passive learning, according to which students are not conceptualized as receptacles of information but as active participants in the learning process, motivated, frequently, by curiosity. A central component of active learning is learning how to challenge texts and their authors, not to see them as unquestionable authorities, but as meriting further clarification, interpretation, critical challenge, and development. In teaching students to adopt attitudes of benign skepticism and puzzlement, philosophy courses teach students to become more active and independent inquirers. Reading, Writing, Verbal Communication\nBecause many philosophical texts are quite demanding on their readers, one central aim of philosophy courses is to teach students how to read, comprehend, and summarize conceptually difficult material. Students are asked to pay careful attention to conceptual distinctions, to isolate central from peripheral points, to be alert for ambiguities and invalid inferences—in sum, to take an active rather than passive approach to reading. The skills developed in learning how to manage difficult theoretical texts are skills that will serve a student well in many other venues, both within and outside academia’s walls. Although it is an accomplishment for a student to be able to write clear expository prose about a philosophical view, many philosophy courses, especially above the introductory level, stress the importance of learning how to do philosophy, which includes formulating, articulating, and defending one’s own views. No other discipline emphasizes, in the same ways, verbal argumentation and conceptual analysis. Few other disciplines emphasize, to the same degree, students producing their own theories or critical assessments, as distinct from the exposition of existing material. The argument-focused nature of philosophy requires students to become better writers and speakers if they are to succeed in their courses. For this reason many philosophy classes are, whenever appropriate, heavily discussion-based. The discussion can be Socratic: students learn to subject opinions to logical scrutiny by asking pertinent questions, constructing relevant analogies, and critically assessing the consequences of the viewpoints expressed. Students learn the importance of accurate interpretation, logical organization, clarity of expression, due consideration for others’ positions, the use of concrete illustrative examples, and staying focused on the issues at hand. These qualities of philosophical training in writing and speaking make well-taught courses in philosophy especially valuable to pre-professional students as well as to those pursuing a more general education. The Transmission of Cultural Heritage\nMore so than any other academic discipline, philosophy studies the history of ideas and texts that have profoundly shaped Western thought about basic ethical values, political systems and ideals, human rights, the human good, the nature of knowledge and science, and the fundamental structure of reality. The history of philosophy is virtually the history of our intellectual heritage. It is hard to overestimate the ways in which our contemporary thought has been influenced by such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, and others. Their texts repay careful study, not only because in learning about them we learn something about ourselves, but also because the issues they raise and arguments they present are perennial, as timely now as they were then. In recent years, philosophy departments have become increasingly mindful that the traditional Western canon needs to be located within a plurality of intellectual traditions. Some departments now offer courses in Asian philosophy (Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Near Eastern philosophies), African philosophy, Latin American philosophy, and African-American philosophy. Reality, Knowledge, and Value\nInquisitive students can find themselves engaging in metaphysical thought when, for example, they wonder whether the world described by the natural sciences is all that exists, or whether humans have freedom of will if the world is deterministic, or whether there is an afterlife. They raise questions in epistemology when they inquire about the scope and limits of human knowledge: How much, if anything, can be known for certain? What are the sources of knowledge? When is it legitimate to accept the testimony of others, and on what grounds?\n\nThe profession of philosophy, largely under the leadership of the American Philosophical Association, has taken steps which, together with a pattern of a significant number of faculty approaching retirement, have gradually moved the market toward equilibrium between supply and demand of PhDs. Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy \"pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.\n\nDo you ask why? Do you want to understand what reality is, what can be known, and what makes actions right and wrong? Philosophy will appeal to your sense of curiosity about the world, as you explore topics such as justice, knowledge, reality, and truth: the ideas that have shaped our world over time. Yet the study of philosophy also prepares you for many challenges, as you analyze and evaluate the ideas of others, and clarify and defend your own ideas. You will develop problem solving abilities, communication skills, persuasive powers, and writing skills—skills needed to develop a rewarding career and a meaningful life. With its emphasis on logic, analysis, and clarity of thought, philosophy is an excellent preparation for professional fields such as artificial intelligence, business, communications, government, information sciences, law, medicine, public relations, and writing—as well as graduate study in philosophy, theology, and many other disciplines. The Philosophy Department is committed to diversity, equity, access and inclusive excellence across our curriculum. Watch as Professor Fields explains the importance of philosophy. Our faculty represent a diversity of backgrounds and areas of specialization, including ethics, logic, metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of religion, and philosophy of science. Our curriculum focuses on four areas:\nFor the major, you'll complete 33 credits, consisting of five core courses and electives from the above areas for an overall total of 120 credits. When you minor in philosophy, you'll develop analytical skills and learn to cultivate clarity of thought. The philosophy minor makes an excellent addition to your academic career, because training in philosophy is highly regarded in professional fields such as law, medicine, business, and government. For the minor, you'll complete 18 credit hours.\n\nPhilosophy wonders about the world, and wonders that one even exists — and why. Philosophy poses questions of existence, meaning and value: What can we know? What is real? What is the good life? These questions have found expression in an ever-expanding set of philosophical texts. The philosophical investigation of such issues is always undertaken in dialogue with other philosophers, past and present. The study of philosophy, and the love of wisdom it engenders, form an excellent foundation for further study and for careers in many fields. More importantly, the study of philosophy helps us to develop what Socrates called \"the examined life,\" which for him was the only life worth living. Philosophical studies lead us to examine ourselves and to clarify our own basic commitments and values. Why study philosophy? Because it deepens and enriches our lives. Why Philosophy at Stetson University? Stetson's Philosophy department deepens and enriches the lives of our students through mentored research by way of one-on-one conversations. The Philosophy departmental seminar provides a forum for faculty members and students to interact in a thoughtful way. Each year, the entire philosophy faculty joins students for an upper-level course. One faculty member chooses the topic and leads the class, but all participate, allowing students to experience and engage in philosophical dialogue in a collaborative environment. The Philosophy Club is a monthly meeting of the minds involving faculty, philosophy majors and minors, and students interested in pursuing advanced studies in philosophy. A student convener sets the agenda and distributes texts for discussion. Philosophy Club meetings allow students and professors to continue their philosophical dialogue outside of class in a congenial atmosphere. \"I’ve taken away the importance of thinking about thinking. In one way or another, philosophy is about examining how and why we think about our world and the things in it..\"\nNoah McGahagin '22\n\"I am a legal assistant for a small law firm in Winter Park, and I would say it realized my plans as I knew I wanted to study philosophy to gain reading skills and interpretation skills to enable me to have a successful future in law school.\" Miracle Duff ’21\nA bachelor's degree in Philosophy or Religious Studies opens doors in multiple career fields, including post-secondary and secondary school teaching, law, education administration and software development, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The median annual wage is $55,000, but can be more for graduates who go on to obtain a law or doctorate degree. A degree in philosophy is one of the top academic paths for students considering graduate school, especially students considering law school. Philosophy's emphasis on logic is considered a critical stepping-stone to some legal careers. Stetson Philosophy majors have found work in law, education, the tech industry and medicine. Many of our majors go on to law school and many have pursued graduate work in philosophy and law at distinguished universities, including Oxford University, Cornell Law, London School of Economics and Political Science, Columbia University, University of Sussex, Georgetown University, Stetson College of Law and many more. Students in the Philosophy program study such courses as Introduction to Philosophy, Introduction to Logic, History of Ancient Philosophy, History of Modern Philosophy, Philosophy of Law, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Language and more. Stetson's core values are the focus of several courses, including Social and Political Philosophy (social justice), Existentialism (ethical or spiritual inquiry), Feminist Philosophy (social justice), Philosophy of Race (social justice) and Philosophy of Religion (ethical or spiritual inquiry). The Philosophy program also has developed a distinctive research track that culminates in grant-funded presentations at conferences. The Senior Project is the capstone course in the philosophy curriculum and is designed for students seeking the bachelor of arts degree with a major in Philosophy. This project takes the form of a senior thesis and is usually undertaken in the Fall of their senior year. This project includes a one-on-one, faculty-supervised process of planning, research, writing and oral defense of the thesis, and provides philosophy majors with an opportunity to integrate and focus their philosophical interests and skills on a subject of their own choosing.\n\nUndergraduates in Philosophy\nThe Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Philosophy combines a rigorous education in Philosophy with opportunities for interdisciplinary integration and connection with the arts, literature and sciences. Philosophy engages life's deepest and most persistent questions:\n- What is the nature of the Good Life? - Why do we believe what we believe? - How do we know what we know? - What is the nature of the self, its connection with the world and society? - What are the foundations of Justice? Reasons to pursue the BA in Philosophy:\nThe degree in Philosophy provides graduates with skills and attributes that are highly sought after today:\n- Critical Thinking\n- Problem Solving\nMoreover, Philosophy majors acquire superior preparation for admission to graduate and professional schools (including medical school) as measured by graduate examinations such as the GRE (graduate school), LSAT (law) and MCAT (medical). Philosophy graduates hone their ability to think analytically, question received wisdom, reevaluate even deeply held beliefs, and cultivate what is best in one's character. You will gain invaluable tools for determining what constitutes the Good Life and how to pursue it (including finding a worthwhile career! ).\n\nThey require me to be both a teacher and a bona fide philosopher at the same time, and balance two different tasks–catching students up with new material in an accessible way and responding to their ideas creatively and rigorously without going over their heads. So basically, I still use the exact skills of a college philosophy professor. I am also a philosophical practitioner who uses philosophy to help people through their practical problems in life. This could mean their existential struggles about how to live a good life. Sometimes it’s tangible relationship issues. Other times they’re working through ethical dilemmas or philosophical questions about what is of genuine value and how someone figures that out in order to live meaningfully. And many formerly religious people come to me for individualized help working out their post-religious worldview on philosophical matters. We live in a culture where many people are accustomed to turning to religious sources to answering properly philosophical questions about metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, the relationship between mind and body. I see my blogging, my online philosophy classes, and my private philosophical practice as each about reclaiming these areas as properly philosophical subjects. I write an occasional Philosophical Advice column which showcases what such advice looks like in reply to questions from readers so you can get an idea of what it’s all about. And while I make no claims to treating mental illness or even lesser psychological maladies, I want to affirm and apply the value of properly philosophical inquiry into the internal rationality of someone’s beliefs and values as a viable approach to solving their existential, ethical, and relational problems. These techniques won’t work for everyone and they won’t cure properly neurological problems. But not everyone with a practical problem has a psychological problem. Lou Marinoff calls philosophical practice “therapy for the sane”. Psychologically healthy people have problems too. Because beliefs, values, and personal behaviors are hard to square rationally and that’s what I find my kind of practicality focused philosophical mind well equipped to help people with. 3. What do you think the role of the modern philosopher is—or what do you think it should be? I think the role of philosophers is to work out the most rational approaches to normative problems that we can. Empirical thinking has become impressive on a hitherto unimagined scale. We need equal ability to formulate normative thinking that goes beyond what we discover about what is to rationally as possible determining what ought to be. And that takes a ton of philosophical clarity in tandem with ever updating empirical information. We need to constantly engage with the other disciplines and advise them on the philosophical issues that arise from their work, rein in other fields’ occasional tendencies to make philosophically sloppy over extensions of their findings on the theoretical level, and, most of all, be at the vanguard of philosophically synthesizing the meaning and interrelations between the findings of different fields. We need, in other words, to be working out the avenues for integrating information into coherent pictures of the world that reconcile the differing perspectives of differing disciplines and of the ordinary lifeworld into something coherent. And we need to still work on gaining as much conceptual clarity, consistency, and logical rigor in all the places where there are empirical gaps. There are many important issues people inevitably must have provisional views about that are not yet formulated in empirically rigorous terms, either because the relevant sciences haven’t figured out how to do so yet or because such empirical methods will actually wind up never being up to the task. In those cases, we need to be as conceptually clear, consistent, and logical as possible and the disciplined imaginations of philosophers are ideal to continue doing this work. Hopefully it can even be the kind of job that aids the empiricists in adequately empiricizing these issues in time, wherever possible. And finally, I think it’s a job for philosophers to educate the public constructively and relevantly about the raft of philosophical issues that everyone inevitably makes decisions about–who should I believe? what is right and wrong? what is just? what should I make of God and religion? in what ways am I free or not and how should these affect my behavior and my treatment of others? On and on, these philosophical issues are core to everyone’s lives.\n\nCommunication and Theater\nBenefits of the Major\nOur Philosophy about Philosophy\nWe'd like you to come and visit us face-to-face at the Philosophy House on campus where students and faculty gather for seminar classes, philosophical conversation, and ping-pong games. But since you are evidently not in our geographical vicinity except in cyberspace, this computer-to-computer interface will have to do for now!! We enthusiastically welcome e-mail conversations, so don't hesitate to contact us. Faculty e-mail addresses, and some student e-mail addresses can be found below under \"Directory.\" We hope that what follows give you some sense of the \"spirit\" of the department. Benefits of the Major\nWhat Can You Do With a Philosophy Major? We try to prepare our students for life, not just for a \"career.\" We want our students to be thoughtful and reflective persons, wise and responsive parents, active and responsible citizens. We believe that students graduating from our program have something very positive and important to contribute to our society. So we do everything we can to help our junior and senior students prepare for the next stage of their lives. We do one-on-one career counseling with each of our majors and, in coordination with the University's Placement Service, help our students get ready for the \"job market.\" So what can you do with a philosophy major? The only true answer to this question is: with a major in philosophy, you will be prepared to do practically anything that requires communication skills, the ability to think creatively and analytically, and the ability to solve problems. Our Philosophy About Philosophy\nQuestion: Is happiness the same as pleasure? Answer: If you suspect that the answer is no, you will enjoy taking our philosophy courses. If you think the answer is yes, you need to take our philosophy courses. If you are a high school student or have never had a course in it, you may think philosophy is an intellectual mind-game that deals with questions like \"If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound?\" So we should tell you right away that Socrates, who was in a sense the founder of philosophy, was killed for doing it--and people don't usually get killed for playing mind-games. People do tend to get upset if you ask basic questions that require examining the meaning of human existence. This is what Socrates did and what we try to do in our philosophy courses at American Austin University. In our classes students are invited to talk and write about their lives, and about the moral, religious, and political questions that perplex them. There is hardly anything that we don't talk about in our courses. Because of the kind of questions we address in our courses, students often seek to continue our classroom conversations after classes are over. Thinking, writing, and speaking about basic questions is, in our view, what a humane education is all about. These questions have tremendous relevance to all intellectual disciplines--and we explore this relevance in the courses that we teach with other departments (such as Nursing, Political Science and English). The ability to rigorously examine ideas and critically evaluate conflicting views, which you will develop by doing philosophy, is an ability that is of pivotal importance in every intellectual discipline. This is one reason why many of our students find philosophy to be tremendously helpful in their other areas of interest. (Many of our students combine their philosophy major with a major in English, Social Work, or Psychology.) About the Philosophy Department\nThe Department of Philosophy offers a program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, developing students' abilities to think critically, examine fundamental questions about the nature of the self and the world, and thus to establish a foundation for intelligent action in the world. Students are exposed to a variety of philosophical perspectives and asked to philosophize. Because philosophy teaches clear, coherent and creative thinking, it can be of service in almost any field, particularly law, medicine, government, education, computers, publishing and business. The department also prepares students for graduate study in law, theology, social work and philosophy.","passages":[{"passage":"Why study Philosophy? 6 reasons of weight\nAt a time when everything must be valued according to the price that can be paid for it in the market, philosophy is increasingly cornered: it is forgotten and undervalued in the political reforms of education. Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: \"123 wise phrases to reflect on life\"\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:81d92461-8427-44b0-89b9-d5f483d5f171>"]},{"passage":"- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning.

Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d930711-9b1f-42e7-afd1-08291e098a07>"]},{"passage":"Why Study Philosophy?Page address: https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/philosophy\/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill.

Taking a responsible critical stance towards a viewpoint requires attitudes of benign skepticism and an openness to being puzzled. A prominent pedagogical model in higher academia is that of active rather than passive learning, according to which students are not conceptualized as receptacles of information but as active participants in the learning process, motivated, frequently, by curiosity. A central component of active learning is learning how to challenge texts and their authors, not to see them as unquestionable authorities, but as meriting further clarification, interpretation, critical challenge, and development. In teaching students to adopt attitudes of benign skepticism and puzzlement, philosophy courses teach students to become more active and independent inquirers. Reading, Writing, Verbal Communication\nBecause many philosophical texts are quite demanding on their readers, one central aim of philosophy courses is to teach students how to read, comprehend, and summarize conceptually difficult material. Students are asked to pay careful attention to conceptual distinctions, to isolate central from peripheral points, to be alert for ambiguities and invalid inferences—in sum, to take an active rather than passive approach to reading. The skills developed in learning how to manage difficult theoretical texts are skills that will serve a student well in many other venues, both within and outside academia’s walls. Although it is an accomplishment for a student to be able to write clear expository prose about a philosophical view, many philosophy courses, especially above the introductory level, stress the importance of learning how to do philosophy, which includes formulating, articulating, and defending one’s own views. No other discipline emphasizes, in the same ways, verbal argumentation and conceptual analysis. Few other disciplines emphasize, to the same degree, students producing their own theories or critical assessments, as distinct from the exposition of existing material. The argument-focused nature of philosophy requires students to become better writers and speakers if they are to succeed in their courses. For this reason many philosophy classes are, whenever appropriate, heavily discussion-based. The discussion can be Socratic: students learn to subject opinions to logical scrutiny by asking pertinent questions, constructing relevant analogies, and critically assessing the consequences of the viewpoints expressed. Students learn the importance of accurate interpretation, logical organization, clarity of expression, due consideration for others’ positions, the use of concrete illustrative examples, and staying focused on the issues at hand. These qualities of philosophical training in writing and speaking make well-taught courses in philosophy especially valuable to pre-professional students as well as to those pursuing a more general education. The Transmission of Cultural Heritage\nMore so than any other academic discipline, philosophy studies the history of ideas and texts that have profoundly shaped Western thought about basic ethical values, political systems and ideals, human rights, the human good, the nature of knowledge and science, and the fundamental structure of reality. The history of philosophy is virtually the history of our intellectual heritage. It is hard to overestimate the ways in which our contemporary thought has been influenced by such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, and others. Their texts repay careful study, not only because in learning about them we learn something about ourselves, but also because the issues they raise and arguments they present are perennial, as timely now as they were then. In recent years, philosophy departments have become increasingly mindful that the traditional Western canon needs to be located within a plurality of intellectual traditions. Some departments now offer courses in Asian philosophy (Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Near Eastern philosophies), African philosophy, Latin American philosophy, and African-American philosophy. Reality, Knowledge, and Value\nInquisitive students can find themselves engaging in metaphysical thought when, for example, they wonder whether the world described by the natural sciences is all that exists, or whether humans have freedom of will if the world is deterministic, or whether there is an afterlife. They raise questions in epistemology when they inquire about the scope and limits of human knowledge: How much, if anything, can be known for certain? What are the sources of knowledge? When is it legitimate to accept the testimony of others, and on what grounds?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ea680cee-f35b-4066-8bde-6c41186c4d9b>"]},{"passage":"The profession of philosophy, largely under the leadership of the American Philosophical Association, has taken steps which, together with a pattern of a significant number of faculty approaching retirement, have gradually moved the market toward equilibrium between supply and demand of PhDs. Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy \"pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ea680cee-f35b-4066-8bde-6c41186c4d9b>"]},{"passage":"Do you ask why? Do you want to understand what reality is, what can be known, and what makes actions right and wrong? Philosophy will appeal to your sense of curiosity about the world, as you explore topics such as justice, knowledge, reality, and truth: the ideas that have shaped our world over time. Yet the study of philosophy also prepares you for many challenges, as you analyze and evaluate the ideas of others, and clarify and defend your own ideas. You will develop problem solving abilities, communication skills, persuasive powers, and writing skills—skills needed to develop a rewarding career and a meaningful life. With its emphasis on logic, analysis, and clarity of thought, philosophy is an excellent preparation for professional fields such as artificial intelligence, business, communications, government, information sciences, law, medicine, public relations, and writing—as well as graduate study in philosophy, theology, and many other disciplines. The Philosophy Department is committed to diversity, equity, access and inclusive excellence across our curriculum. Watch as Professor Fields explains the importance of philosophy.

Philosophy poses questions of existence, meaning and value: What can we know? What is real? What is the good life? These questions have found expression in an ever-expanding set of philosophical texts. The philosophical investigation of such issues is always undertaken in dialogue with other philosophers, past and present. The study of philosophy, and the love of wisdom it engenders, form an excellent foundation for further study and for careers in many fields. More importantly, the study of philosophy helps us to develop what Socrates called \"the examined life,\" which for him was the only life worth living. Philosophical studies lead us to examine ourselves and to clarify our own basic commitments and values. Why study philosophy? Because it deepens and enriches our lives. Why Philosophy at Stetson University? Stetson's Philosophy department deepens and enriches the lives of our students through mentored research by way of one-on-one conversations. The Philosophy departmental seminar provides a forum for faculty members and students to interact in a thoughtful way. Each year, the entire philosophy faculty joins students for an upper-level course. One faculty member chooses the topic and leads the class, but all participate, allowing students to experience and engage in philosophical dialogue in a collaborative environment. The Philosophy Club is a monthly meeting of the minds involving faculty, philosophy majors and minors, and students interested in pursuing advanced studies in philosophy. A student convener sets the agenda and distributes texts for discussion. Philosophy Club meetings allow students and professors to continue their philosophical dialogue outside of class in a congenial atmosphere. \"I’ve taken away the importance of thinking about thinking.

A degree in philosophy is one of the top academic paths for students considering graduate school, especially students considering law school. Philosophy's emphasis on logic is considered a critical stepping-stone to some legal careers. Stetson Philosophy majors have found work in law, education, the tech industry and medicine. Many of our majors go on to law school and many have pursued graduate work in philosophy and law at distinguished universities, including Oxford University, Cornell Law, London School of Economics and Political Science, Columbia University, University of Sussex, Georgetown University, Stetson College of Law and many more. Students in the Philosophy program study such courses as Introduction to Philosophy, Introduction to Logic, History of Ancient Philosophy, History of Modern Philosophy, Philosophy of Law, Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Language and more. Stetson's core values are the focus of several courses, including Social and Political Philosophy (social justice), Existentialism (ethical or spiritual inquiry), Feminist Philosophy (social justice), Philosophy of Race (social justice) and Philosophy of Religion (ethical or spiritual inquiry). The Philosophy program also has developed a distinctive research track that culminates in grant-funded presentations at conferences.

So basically, I still use the exact skills of a college philosophy professor. I am also a philosophical practitioner who uses philosophy to help people through their practical problems in life. This could mean their existential struggles about how to live a good life. Sometimes it’s tangible relationship issues. Other times they’re working through ethical dilemmas or philosophical questions about what is of genuine value and how someone figures that out in order to live meaningfully. And many formerly religious people come to me for individualized help working out their post-religious worldview on philosophical matters. We live in a culture where many people are accustomed to turning to religious sources to answering properly philosophical questions about metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, the relationship between mind and body. I see my blogging, my online philosophy classes, and my private philosophical practice as each about reclaiming these areas as properly philosophical subjects. I write an occasional Philosophical Advice column which showcases what such advice looks like in reply to questions from readers so you can get an idea of what it’s all about. And while I make no claims to treating mental illness or even lesser psychological maladies, I want to affirm and apply the value of properly philosophical inquiry into the internal rationality of someone’s beliefs and values as a viable approach to solving their existential, ethical, and relational problems. These techniques won’t work for everyone and they won’t cure properly neurological problems. But not everyone with a practical problem has a psychological problem. Lou Marinoff calls philosophical practice “therapy for the sane”. Psychologically healthy people have problems too. Because beliefs, values, and personal behaviors are hard to square rationally and that’s what I find my kind of practicality focused philosophical mind well equipped to help people with. 3. What do you think the role of the modern philosopher is—or what do you think it should be? I think the role of philosophers is to work out the most rational approaches to normative problems that we can. Empirical thinking has become impressive on a hitherto unimagined scale. We need equal ability to formulate normative thinking that goes beyond what we discover about what is to rationally as possible determining what ought to be. And that takes a ton of philosophical clarity in tandem with ever updating empirical information. We need to constantly engage with the other disciplines and advise them on the philosophical issues that arise from their work, rein in other fields’ occasional tendencies to make philosophically sloppy over extensions of their findings on the theoretical level, and, most of all, be at the vanguard of philosophically synthesizing the meaning and interrelations between the findings of different fields. We need, in other words, to be working out the avenues for integrating information into coherent pictures of the world that reconcile the differing perspectives of differing disciplines and of the ordinary lifeworld into something coherent. And we need to still work on gaining as much conceptual clarity, consistency, and logical rigor in all the places where there are empirical gaps. There are many important issues people inevitably must have provisional views about that are not yet formulated in empirically rigorous terms, either because the relevant sciences haven’t figured out how to do so yet or because such empirical methods will actually wind up never being up to the task. In those cases, we need to be as conceptually clear, consistent, and logical as possible and the disciplined imaginations of philosophers are ideal to continue doing this work. Hopefully it can even be the kind of job that aids the empiricists in adequately empiricizing these issues in time, wherever possible. And finally, I think it’s a job for philosophers to educate the public constructively and relevantly about the raft of philosophical issues that everyone inevitably makes decisions about–who should I believe? what is right and wrong? what is just? what should I make of God and religion? in what ways am I free or not and how should these affect my behavior and my treatment of others? On and on, these philosophical issues are core to everyone’s lives.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:deec48fb-9e0a-4034-bfb3-f263139e58b1>"]},{"passage":"Communication and Theater\nBenefits of the Major\nOur Philosophy about Philosophy\nWe'd like you to come and visit us face-to-face at the Philosophy House on campus where students and faculty gather for seminar classes, philosophical conversation, and ping-pong games.

Our Philosophy About Philosophy\nQuestion: Is happiness the same as pleasure? Answer: If you suspect that the answer is no, you will enjoy taking our philosophy courses. If you think the answer is yes, you need to take our philosophy courses. If you are a high school student or have never had a course in it, you may think philosophy is an intellectual mind-game that deals with questions like \"If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound?\" So we should tell you right away that Socrates, who was in a sense the founder of philosophy, was killed for doing it--and people don't usually get killed for playing mind-games. People do tend to get upset if you ask basic questions that require examining the meaning of human existence. This is what Socrates did and what we try to do in our philosophy courses at American Austin University. In our classes students are invited to talk and write about their lives, and about the moral, religious, and political questions that perplex them. There is hardly anything that we don't talk about in our courses. Because of the kind of questions we address in our courses, students often seek to continue our classroom conversations after classes are over.

These questions have tremendous relevance to all intellectual disciplines--and we explore this relevance in the courses that we teach with other departments (such as Nursing, Political Science and English). The ability to rigorously examine ideas and critically evaluate conflicting views, which you will develop by doing philosophy, is an ability that is of pivotal importance in every intellectual discipline.

It is specifically looking for available safety data on 18- to 20-year-old drivers who operate commercial vehicles in intrastate commerce, where drivers this age are currently allowed to operate. This is an effort years in the making. The FMCSA said it was petitioned to consider this change as far back as October 2, 2000 when the Truckload Carriers Association asked the agency to consider such a pilot. The FMCSA held a public comment period the next year and received 1,600 comments, with 90% of them opposed to the idea on the basis younger drivers lack the maturity for the job, the agency explained in its Federal Register posting. \"None explained how interstate drivers under 21 would diminish safety when most States have concluded that intrastate drivers under 21 do not do so,\" FMCSA said of the 2001 comments. \"Very few truck drivers and motor carriers commented, but most of them also opposed the pilot program.\" The petition was denied in 2003.\n\nAge: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2.

However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck. You also need to be specific about the type of commercial vehicle that you will be practicing on.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of the Drive Safe Act, you may be either shocked or pleased to learn that a bill has been filed that would authorize 18-21 year olds to drive 18-wheelers professionally on the interstate, whereas now they must be 21. In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act\nOn February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety\/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport.

Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert.

New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck.

In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act\nOn February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety\/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

It will be available on August 11.\nEastasiasoft has passed along the following overview and trailer for Crimson Spires:\nTake the role of Sheriff Erika Wright as an investigation brings her to the small mining town of Bataille, where she is suddenly trapped by a ring of deadly, glowing towers encircling the community. Here she meets residents of a disarming variety, from extreme conspiracy theorists to wealthy vampires and a serial killer. Guide Erika’s decisions as she forms uneasy alliances and finds love through partnership. Amidst the horrors facing Bataille, romance can blossom with the few people Erika might be able to trust. Each possible relationship reveals valuable secrets about the towers and their surrounding mystery.\nBlending an eerie atmosphere with romance and supernatural mystery, Crimson Spires presents its otome-style narrative with an uncommon degree of freedom. Along its multiple story paths, the experience shifts between rich 2D character art and 3D exploration, allowing you to investigate building interiors and immersing you in the town of Bataille.\nAdditionally, this updated version of Crimson Spires includes New Game Plus content that unlocks after completing all other story routes, interweaving previous narrative threads and bringing Erika’s tale to a climactic finish driven by player choice!\n- Unlock multiple romance paths, each with a distinct narrative.\n- Immerse yourself in the mystery through a blend of 2D and 3D visual styles.\n- Freely navigate locales in first-person perspective.\n- Extend the experience with New Game Plus featuring added story content!\n- Hear key scenes voiced in English by a diverse and talented cast.\n- Enjoy an atmospheric soundtrack by developer and composer Jenny Gibbons.\nCrimson Spires is expected digitally on Switch as an eShop download.\nSource: Eastasiasoft PR","question_category":"Opinion","question_category_desc":"A question asking for a subjective viewpoint","user_category":"Layman","user_category_desc":"A user with little to no specialized knowledge in the subject, seeking simple, clear, and easy-to-understand explanations","question":"What kind of gameplay features can I expect from Crimson Spires? I'm curious about how it plays.","gold":"Crimson Spires is a visual novel that blends 2D character art with 3D exploration. Players can freely navigate building interiors in first-person perspective. The game features multiple romance paths, each with distinct narratives, and includes English voice acting for key scenes. There's also a New Game Plus mode that unlocks after completing all story routes, adding extra story content and leading to a climactic finish based on player choices.","answer":"In Crimson Skies, the gameplay is a blend of simulation and arcade-style action, focusing on aerial combat and gunplay. You'll control a variety of muscle planes, which are heavily customized with different engines, armor, and weapons. The game offers a realistic flight simulation aspect, requiring you to manage your aircraft's performance and handle in-flight maneuvers, but it also includes fast-paced dogfights and strategic combat scenarios.\n\nPlayers navigate through a 1930s-inspired world, engaging in missions that range from simple escort duties to more complex heists and battles. The game's action sequences are designed to be intense and engaging, with a focus on both shooting and evasion. The combat is highly tactical, as you'll need to manage your ammo, weapon upgrades, and the condition of your plane while engaging in combat.\n\nAdditionally, Crimson Skies features a robust crafting system that allows you to customize your aircraft with various upgrades and modifications. This adds another layer of depth to the gameplay, as players can tailor their planes to suit their preferred playstyle.\n\nThe game also includes an Instant Action mode for those who want to jump into the fray without going through the story missions. This mode lets you engage in various combat scenarios, such as dogfighting enemy fighters or attempting to hijack a zeppelin, providing a quick and straightforward way to experience the game's action.\n\nOverall, Crimson Skies offers a dynamic and immersive experience, combining detailed aircraft controls with thrilling aerial combat and strategic decision-making.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Yo ho! Yo ho! A pirate's life for me. Okay, when I say pirates, what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Chances\nare, you just pictured the skull and crossbones, some dude that looks like Captain\nHook, or even that drunk guy hanging out with a pig in the Pirates of the Caribbean\nride at Disneyland. But what if the path of history took a different course\nand pirates turned out to be smooth talking, fearless warriors of the air rather\nthan liquor-guzzling sea ruffians? Well, Microsoft and Zipper Interactive have\nimagined just that and cranked out a game worthy of an old Hollywood studio. It is a world of gutsy pilots and high adventure. The Great Depression has\nstruck, destroying the progress of all ground transportation, leaving the skies\nto serve as the ultimate roadway of the future. Here, survival means gripping\nthe flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the\ntalking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding\nflight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n\"story\" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.\n\n\"Grant Howitt's games are always strong on play experiences. With Spire, he and Chris Taylor have carved out a compelling space for us to play in, too -- a dark, desperate setting that nonetheless has room for hope and beauty, and looks very different from the familiar worlds of mainstream roleplaying games.” - merritt k, host of Woodland Secrets, designer of Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You\n\"I'm so glad you guys are creating another game together.\" - Rob Heinsoo, lead designer on D&D 4e and 13th Age\n“Spire deals with skills in a way that makes every check as interesting and as much of a threat as combat, the world feels huge and unique, and the classes are just beautifully ridiculous.” - Dylan Malenfant, playtester\n“Spire is a tinderbox of evocative potential weaved together to form the most compelling setting I've read this decade. It features the kind of resonance Neil Gaiman aims for on a good day.” - Sean Smith, author of Exuviae\n\"This setting is really dazzling. I want to try out these characters!\" - Jason Cordova of The Gauntlet podcast\n\"So you're telling me one of the classes just comes with a hyena? 'Core abilities: Hyena' is what you should put on the cover instead of review blurbs.\" - General Ironicus of the Six Feats Under podcast\n“I've never said 'I want to use that' so many times as when making my Spire character. Every word reinforces the eerie setting, and the mechanics fizz with a perfect blend of weirdness, power and risk.” - Clare Jones, playtester\n\"Grant Howitt always seems to be involved in the kinds of games that make me wish I had more time to play games – and more time to write games. Always inspiring and challenging. The Spire is no different, with a strong focus on storytelling, the mechanics geared towards great roleplaying in a world that offers something we’ve not seen before. The sort of game experience that’s not just fun, but actually rewarding to play.\" - Gav Thorpe, author of Inquisitor and, like, half the Warhammer 40k universe\nWHAT IS THE SPIRE? Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.\n\nBecause I was so intrigued by this title I wanted to know a bit more about the game so I also asked a couple of other questions regarding gameplay and the overall look of the game. Q: Can you describe a bit about how the game will play? With so many references to other game titles, it leaves me wondering what the gameplay style will be like. A: The game will be divided in two parts: the action sequences, and the question sequences. In the action sequences, you control Jeanne like in a regular platformer. You can climb ladders and walls, look at some elements in the background, talk with NPC and so on. There is no inventory, only a stamina\/life gauge that you’ll have to look for. The more you run, climb and fall from high heights, the more Jeanne will be exhausted, which can be annoying if you’re chased by an enemy. Those action sequences will also probably include some infiltration mechanics. The question sequences will pop up (kind of) randomly during the game. A question will be asked to Jeanne and depending on the player’s answer (among 2 choices), the game and scenario will take some new orientations. The thing is, we don’t talk about 10 or 20 questions in the whole game, but around 300. Theses questions will act like a psychological test on the game and will also be a way for me to tell the story. After answering a question, the player will be sent to another action sequence and so on. Q: The screens that you included in your press kit are all very intriguing! It looks as if the game will take place across many different areas. Would you like to go into any detail about the various areas available to players? A: To be perfectly true, I’m still searching what “kind” of horror I will push, and I really don’t know yet if all the visuals I sent you will be in the final game. I’m still searching, now I’m just throwing out ideas, and I’ll see which ones I’ll keep on the way. The things I can say for sure are:\n– The action will take place in a “kind of” European city (mostly inspired by Paris and Italian cities like Milan or Rome). – There won’t be any zombies in it or Silent Hill-esque monsters. I’d prefer to look more in esoteric themes. – Jeanne is an actress, so yeah, some sequences will take place in theaters or on movie sets. – The pyramid on the moon will be one of the key places of the story. There is no denying that the gameplay mechanics sound interesting. I’m digging the bits about her becoming exhausted even if that could happen at inopportune moments. We will definitely keep up with Jeanne as the game is being developed and see what sort of look the game will ultimately take on, and the various locations that will be available to players. Checkout the trailer and be sure to let us know what you think!\n\nokay so i just talked to one of my old friends who loves workin on this with me, and he reminded me how off-track i was. Youre in a DREAM for god sake, anything is possible! Like fewar said, this is just a game, nothin special or unordinary except maybe the sketchbook\nwe talked a lot about the combat, storyline, and level-to-level progression, and i wanted to share one or two things he mentioned and see what yall think\n1. Combat. Direct combat like this is a bad idea past the beginning. As you go through the game, you learn to control your dream state more and more. At first itll be new, so of course youll just think \"hack slash\" but eventually you want to get to a point where, for example.. If youre fighting a big-ass monster (like in Shadows of the Colossus or whatever it was called), instead of attacking, switch to 1st person camera and crush it between your fingers. Suddenly you have no weapons and magic doesnt seem to work? Grab the fear meter and bash their heads in! Stuff like that. Anything is possible, and one thing about the game is that it's a puzzle. You have to find ways to kill enemies rather than the old hack-slash method. 2. Level organization. Rather than having 1 meager level like it is now, it needs to change drastically on itself, like real dreams do. For example, one big map\/level would have 5 areas: elated, depressed, petrified, charmed, and insane. Doesnt have to be 5, but the point stands. Throughout each part, the way the map works (enemies sneaking up in the dark, oddities, etc) will change, depending on the theme of the section of the map\nYou have to go throughout all sections of the map to complete it. What do yall think? Also, this is the ultimate feedback i'm looking for. Think there's something lacking that would be really cool? TELL IT\nAlso, about the level organization, how many sections would you say, and what would they be? Perhaps also a Challenge section, with multiple mini-bosses and the level's final boss\n\nAmong the various aspects of Deep Shadows' action RPG that Alexander Khrutsky is asked about in this Xenus interview is what the gameplay will be like:\nThe gameplay in Xenus combines the features of two genres. The system of experience, number of parameters, system of weapons upgrade, the ability of communication with all characters, system of information or goods trade - all this is related to role part. Also the character can always turn to the special list of missions, read it or write new entries to the special diary. But, besides, Kevin will have to fight with different forces' representatives a lot, complete primary and secondary tasks - the first ones are important for the storyline, the second ones are completing if necessary. They can give some new interesting details or just help to earn money, or to gain some group's respect. There will be no division into levels or missions in the game. The entire game, completion of tasks, moving over the big localtion - all this takes place in real time. The response above mentions the main character, one Kevin Myers. The story involves his search for his sister, an investigative journalist who has gone missing in Colombia.\n\n- A dark story told in the gothic novel style in eight epic chapters\n- Play as Dr. Styles and Samantha\n- Innovative gameplay that combines science and the supernatural\n43.

Yo ho! A pirate's life for me. Okay, when I say pirates, what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Chances\nare, you just pictured the skull and crossbones, some dude that looks like Captain\nHook, or even that drunk guy hanging out with a pig in the Pirates of the Caribbean\nride at Disneyland. But what if the path of history took a different course\nand pirates turned out to be smooth talking, fearless warriors of the air rather\nthan liquor-guzzling sea ruffians? Well, Microsoft and Zipper Interactive have\nimagined just that and cranked out a game worthy of an old Hollywood studio. It is a world of gutsy pilots and high adventure. The Great Depression has\nstruck, destroying the progress of all ground transportation, leaving the skies\nto serve as the ultimate roadway of the future. Here, survival means gripping\nthe flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the\ntalking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding\nflight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n\"story\" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cb418f65-8567-428d-a715-3c81864ba6e1>"]},{"passage":"\"Grant Howitt's games are always strong on play experiences. With Spire, he and Chris Taylor have carved out a compelling space for us to play in, too -- a dark, desperate setting that nonetheless has room for hope and beauty, and looks very different from the familiar worlds of mainstream roleplaying games.” - merritt k, host of Woodland Secrets, designer of Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You\n\"I'm so glad you guys are creating another game together.\" - Rob Heinsoo, lead designer on D&D 4e and 13th Age\n“Spire deals with skills in a way that makes every check as interesting and as much of a threat as combat, the world feels huge and unique, and the classes are just beautifully ridiculous.” - Dylan Malenfant, playtester\n“Spire is a tinderbox of evocative potential weaved together to form the most compelling setting I've read this decade. It features the kind of resonance Neil Gaiman aims for on a good day.” - Sean Smith, author of Exuviae\n\"This setting is really dazzling. I want to try out these characters!\" - Jason Cordova of The Gauntlet podcast\n\"So you're telling me one of the classes just comes with a hyena? 'Core abilities: Hyena' is what you should put on the cover instead of review blurbs.\" - General Ironicus of the Six Feats Under podcast\n“I've never said 'I want to use that' so many times as when making my Spire character. Every word reinforces the eerie setting, and the mechanics fizz with a perfect blend of weirdness, power and risk.” - Clare Jones, playtester\n\"Grant Howitt always seems to be involved in the kinds of games that make me wish I had more time to play games – and more time to write games. Always inspiring and challenging. The Spire is no different, with a strong focus on storytelling, the mechanics geared towards great roleplaying in a world that offers something we’ve not seen before. The sort of game experience that’s not just fun, but actually rewarding to play.\" - Gav Thorpe, author of Inquisitor and, like, half the Warhammer 40k universe\nWHAT IS THE SPIRE? Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7a8a5c85-be2f-423b-9c36-fd8767d87000>"]},{"passage":"Because I was so intrigued by this title I wanted to know a bit more about the game so I also asked a couple of other questions regarding gameplay and the overall look of the game. Q: Can you describe a bit about how the game will play? With so many references to other game titles, it leaves me wondering what the gameplay style will be like. A: The game will be divided in two parts: the action sequences, and the question sequences. In the action sequences, you control Jeanne like in a regular platformer. You can climb ladders and walls, look at some elements in the background, talk with NPC and so on. There is no inventory, only a stamina\/life gauge that you’ll have to look for. The more you run, climb and fall from high heights, the more Jeanne will be exhausted, which can be annoying if you’re chased by an enemy. Those action sequences will also probably include some infiltration mechanics. The question sequences will pop up (kind of) randomly during the game. A question will be asked to Jeanne and depending on the player’s answer (among 2 choices), the game and scenario will take some new orientations. The thing is, we don’t talk about 10 or 20 questions in the whole game, but around 300. Theses questions will act like a psychological test on the game and will also be a way for me to tell the story. After answering a question, the player will be sent to another action sequence and so on. Q: The screens that you included in your press kit are all very intriguing! It looks as if the game will take place across many different areas. Would you like to go into any detail about the various areas available to players? A: To be perfectly true, I’m still searching what “kind” of horror I will push, and I really don’t know yet if all the visuals I sent you will be in the final game. I’m still searching, now I’m just throwing out ideas, and I’ll see which ones I’ll keep on the way. The things I can say for sure are:\n– The action will take place in a “kind of” European city (mostly inspired by Paris and Italian cities like Milan or Rome). – There won’t be any zombies in it or Silent Hill-esque monsters. I’d prefer to look more in esoteric themes. – Jeanne is an actress, so yeah, some sequences will take place in theaters or on movie sets. – The pyramid on the moon will be one of the key places of the story. There is no denying that the gameplay mechanics sound interesting. I’m digging the bits about her becoming exhausted even if that could happen at inopportune moments. We will definitely keep up with Jeanne as the game is being developed and see what sort of look the game will ultimately take on, and the various locations that will be available to players. Checkout the trailer and be sure to let us know what you think!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8eae1e07-5c7d-461e-bf7d-e3ff885c28ff>"]},{"passage":"okay so i just talked to one of my old friends who loves workin on this with me, and he reminded me how off-track i was. Youre in a DREAM for god sake, anything is possible! Like fewar said, this is just a game, nothin special or unordinary except maybe the sketchbook\nwe talked a lot about the combat, storyline, and level-to-level progression, and i wanted to share one or two things he mentioned and see what yall think\n1. Combat. Direct combat like this is a bad idea past the beginning. As you go through the game, you learn to control your dream state more and more. At first itll be new, so of course youll just think \"hack slash\" but eventually you want to get to a point where, for example.. If youre fighting a big-ass monster (like in Shadows of the Colossus or whatever it was called), instead of attacking, switch to 1st person camera and crush it between your fingers. Suddenly you have no weapons and magic doesnt seem to work? Grab the fear meter and bash their heads in! Stuff like that. Anything is possible, and one thing about the game is that it's a puzzle. You have to find ways to kill enemies rather than the old hack-slash method. 2. Level organization. Rather than having 1 meager level like it is now, it needs to change drastically on itself, like real dreams do. For example, one big map\/level would have 5 areas: elated, depressed, petrified, charmed, and insane. Doesnt have to be 5, but the point stands. Throughout each part, the way the map works (enemies sneaking up in the dark, oddities, etc) will change, depending on the theme of the section of the map\nYou have to go throughout all sections of the map to complete it. What do yall think? Also, this is the ultimate feedback i'm looking for. Think there's something lacking that would be really cool? TELL IT\nAlso, about the level organization, how many sections would you say, and what would they be? Perhaps also a Challenge section, with multiple mini-bosses and the level's final boss","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0b20143d-b93c-46f3-ace3-c10ef2482b62>"]},{"passage":"Among the various aspects of Deep Shadows' action RPG that Alexander Khrutsky is asked about in this Xenus interview is what the gameplay will be like:\nThe gameplay in Xenus combines the features of two genres.

Also the character can always turn to the special list of missions, read it or write new entries to the special diary. But, besides, Kevin will have to fight with different forces' representatives a lot, complete primary and secondary tasks - the first ones are important for the storyline, the second ones are completing if necessary. They can give some new interesting details or just help to earn money, or to gain some group's respect. There will be no division into levels or missions in the game.

As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer. If you’re ready to take a look at Agile, or to learn more about the methodology, Braintrust Consulting is here to help. We offer training and coaching on the Agile methodology leading to such certifications for your team as Certified ScrumMaster and Certified Scrum Product Owner. We have public classes or we can bring the training to you, customized to fit your needs.

Our parents instilled the habit of saving in us when we were young so that we would become accustomed to a tight budget. Piggy banks were a common way for us to save money. As more people use bank services to save money, the use of piggy banks is now gradually starting to decline. Banks keep up with the times by developing new features and products to enhance their services. It is undeniable that this service upgrade makes it simpler for customers to conduct financial activities, such as saving money in a bank. Customers who keep their money in banks now have access to SMS Banking, mobile banking, and online banking services in addition to ATMs. The more customers who want to save money, the more competition there is among banks to offer the best service. People also started to compare the benefits and drawbacks of several banks before making a decision about which bank to use. People can then select banking services based on their needs rather than current trends. That’s why we have to keep our money in the bank, for the register you can check in here online bank account creation malaysia. This is the Advantage of Saving in the Bank\n- Interest Profit and Profit Sharing\nEven though interest rates are typically not the primary factor for customers, interest nevertheless affects the money that is saved. Indeed, the benefits of interest are quite meager. However, the savings interest will offer large advantages if you save for a long time and your periodic sums of money are growing. One of the key elements of bank savings is security. Physical and virtual layers of security are present at the Bank. The bank works with the Deposit Insurance Corporation virtually to ensure the security of money (LPS). The customer’s funds can still be removed because they are guaranteed by LPS in the event that something goes wrong that negatively affects the bank. - Freedom in Transaction\nAll banks provide consumers with a wide range of features. In addition to having the chance to save money, you can conduct financial transactions. The transaction features often consist of a variety of items, including transfers and cash withdrawals from ATMs, SMS Banking, or internet banking. These features make it simple for clients to conduct transactions around-the-clock. Additionally, customers’ freedom to transact is increased. - More Practical and Simple\nSaving money in a bank is more logical and straightforward. You only need to organise your funds by glancing at the information in the passbook that the bank provides. In other words, you may think of your passbook as your financial statement. The quantity of money coming in and going out can be determined using the passbook. Financial transactions are easier because of the ATM machine’s cash deposit feature. To simply make a deposit, you don’t need to visit the bank. - Chance to Get Prizes\nBecause the bank would provide its customers rewards, saving money in the bank becomes quite enticing. Actually, not every purchaser receives this freebie. Lotteries are used to give prizes. Nevertheless, a lot of individuals were interested in the lucky draw. The promised prizes could consist of fancy cars or billions of dollars, which is the reason. The likelihood of winning prizes increases as you save more consistently.\n\nWhat is a Product? “Product is anything that can be offered to someone to satisfy a need or a want.”-Philip Kotler. What are Product Features? Product features are defined as a product’s traits or attributes that deliver value to end-users or customers. When it comes to software, product features can include any softwares functionalities, capabilities, and even its visual characteristics are known as the user interface. But the main trait of any product feature is the value it delivers to a customer. Difference between Features vs benefits ? Features refer to the specific functionalities, characteristics, or properties of the product or service. These are the tangible and measurable aspects of what the product or service can do or offer. For example, the features of a smartphone might include a high-resolution camera, a large storage capacity, and a fast processor. Benefits, on the other hand, refer to the positive outcomes or advantages that the user or customer will experience from using the product or service. Benefits are often intangible and emotional, and they focus on how the product or service can improve the customer's life or solve a problem. For example, the benefits of a smartphone might include the ability to capture high-quality photos, stay connected with friends and family, and access information quickly and easily. How to prioritize Product Features? Feature prioritization is the process of deciding which features to implement first. It determines which features should be implemented first to maximize the product's value. Prioritizing product features can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:\nIdentify the problem your product is solving: Start by understanding the problem your product is solving and the value it brings to your target market. Define your product vision: Create a product vision statement that outlines the key benefits and features of your product. Gather customer feedback: Collect feedback from your customers or potential customers through surveys, interviews, and user testing to identify the features that are most important to them. Analyze data: Analyze data on how customers are currently using your product and what features are being used the most. Prioritize features based on impact and effort: Use a prioritization framework such as the \"MoSCoW method\" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) or \"RICE\" (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them. Set goals: Set clear goals for each feature, including what problem it solves, what benefit it brings, and what metrics you will use to measure its success. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust your feature prioritization based on customer feedback, market changes, and other factors that may impact your product's success. What are feature prioritization frameworks? - RICE Framework\n- The MoSCoW Method\n- KANO Model\n- ICE Scoring\n- The Urgent vs. Important Matrix\n- Value Vs. Effort matrix\n- Story mapping\n- Opportunity Scoring\n- Weighted Scoring\n- Product Tree\n- Feature Voting","passages":[{"passage":"As a parent it is important to be able to provide for your child.

As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer. If you’re ready to take a look at Agile, or to learn more about the methodology, Braintrust Consulting is here to help.

Our parents instilled the habit of saving in us when we were young so that we would become accustomed to a tight budget. Piggy banks were a common way for us to save money. As more people use bank services to save money, the use of piggy banks is now gradually starting to decline. Banks keep up with the times by developing new features and products to enhance their services. It is undeniable that this service upgrade makes it simpler for customers to conduct financial activities, such as saving money in a bank. Customers who keep their money in banks now have access to SMS Banking, mobile banking, and online banking services in addition to ATMs. The more customers who want to save money, the more competition there is among banks to offer the best service. People also started to compare the benefits and drawbacks of several banks before making a decision about which bank to use. People can then select banking services based on their needs rather than current trends. That’s why we have to keep our money in the bank, for the register you can check in here online bank account creation malaysia. This is the Advantage of Saving in the Bank\n- Interest Profit and Profit Sharing\nEven though interest rates are typically not the primary factor for customers, interest nevertheless affects the money that is saved. Indeed, the benefits of interest are quite meager. However, the savings interest will offer large advantages if you save for a long time and your periodic sums of money are growing. One of the key elements of bank savings is security. Physical and virtual layers of security are present at the Bank. The bank works with the Deposit Insurance Corporation virtually to ensure the security of money (LPS). The customer’s funds can still be removed because they are guaranteed by LPS in the event that something goes wrong that negatively affects the bank. - Freedom in Transaction\nAll banks provide consumers with a wide range of features. In addition to having the chance to save money, you can conduct financial transactions. The transaction features often consist of a variety of items, including transfers and cash withdrawals from ATMs, SMS Banking, or internet banking. These features make it simple for clients to conduct transactions around-the-clock. Additionally, customers’ freedom to transact is increased. - More Practical and Simple\nSaving money in a bank is more logical and straightforward. You only need to organise your funds by glancing at the information in the passbook that the bank provides. In other words, you may think of your passbook as your financial statement. The quantity of money coming in and going out can be determined using the passbook. Financial transactions are easier because of the ATM machine’s cash deposit feature. To simply make a deposit, you don’t need to visit the bank. - Chance to Get Prizes\nBecause the bank would provide its customers rewards, saving money in the bank becomes quite enticing. Actually, not every purchaser receives this freebie. Lotteries are used to give prizes. Nevertheless, a lot of individuals were interested in the lucky draw. The promised prizes could consist of fancy cars or billions of dollars, which is the reason. The likelihood of winning prizes increases as you save more consistently.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a01091dc-6c05-4dc9-ac83-f568e14e6260>"]},{"passage":"What is a Product? “Product is anything that can be offered to someone to satisfy a need or a want.”-Philip Kotler. What are Product Features? Product features are defined as a product’s traits or attributes that deliver value to end-users or customers. When it comes to software, product features can include any softwares functionalities, capabilities, and even its visual characteristics are known as the user interface. But the main trait of any product feature is the value it delivers to a customer. Difference between Features vs benefits ? Features refer to the specific functionalities, characteristics, or properties of the product or service. These are the tangible and measurable aspects of what the product or service can do or offer. For example, the features of a smartphone might include a high-resolution camera, a large storage capacity, and a fast processor. Benefits, on the other hand, refer to the positive outcomes or advantages that the user or customer will experience from using the product or service. Benefits are often intangible and emotional, and they focus on how the product or service can improve the customer's life or solve a problem. For example, the benefits of a smartphone might include the ability to capture high-quality photos, stay connected with friends and family, and access information quickly and easily. How to prioritize Product Features? Feature prioritization is the process of deciding which features to implement first. It determines which features should be implemented first to maximize the product's value. Prioritizing product features can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:\nIdentify the problem your product is solving: Start by understanding the problem your product is solving and the value it brings to your target market. Define your product vision: Create a product vision statement that outlines the key benefits and features of your product. Gather customer feedback: Collect feedback from your customers or potential customers through surveys, interviews, and user testing to identify the features that are most important to them. Analyze data: Analyze data on how customers are currently using your product and what features are being used the most. Prioritize features based on impact and effort: Use a prioritization framework such as the \"MoSCoW method\" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) or \"RICE\" (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them. Set goals: Set clear goals for each feature, including what problem it solves, what benefit it brings, and what metrics you will use to measure its success. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust your feature prioritization based on customer feedback, market changes, and other factors that may impact your product's success. What are feature prioritization frameworks? - RICE Framework\n- The MoSCoW Method\n- KANO Model\n- ICE Scoring\n- The Urgent vs. Important Matrix\n- Value Vs. Effort matrix\n- Story mapping\n- Opportunity Scoring\n- Weighted Scoring\n- Product Tree\n- Feature Voting","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a10ef853-4bac-4dbd-9244-cf8676f4bb7d>"]}]}

Call them at 970-879-0825, email email@example.com... or visit the Extension Office, 136 Sixth St.\nLast week, I took a couple hikes on some of the trails that have finally dried out from snowmelt. All along the Hinman Fisherman’s Trail was one of my favorite early season flowers, the Glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). This exquisite and delicate small flower features curved yellow petals with stamens that protrude from the flower’s center. The leafless stems are 6 to 12 inches long and bend at the top giving the flower an elegant drooping profile.\nAlso called dogtooth violet and snow lily, glacier lilies provide early season food for much wildlife in our area, including bears, deer and elk who eat the corms (the swollen underground part of the stem that stores energy for next year — not quite a bulb, but close) and green seed pods, as will sheep and cattle. Ground squirrels and other rodents dig up the corms and store them for winter consumption.\nAlthough it is a really pretty flower that would look great in a meadow or garden, it generally should not be dug up from its habitats in the wild as it sends its corms deep into the soil. Most of us would end up digging up only the leaves and their stems, killing the pretty plant.\nIt’s an edible plant, as well as a spring beauty. The corm is edible raw but tastier and easier to digest when cooked. The stems and leaves of glacier lilies are also edible, although less nutritious than the corms, and can sometimes be found adding a touch of color and texture to salad greens. The seedpod, which forms after the flower bloom has ended, is also edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. It tastes a little like green beans. As with any of these wild edible plants, it’s best to eat in moderation to avoid upsetting your stomach.\nLater in the week, I hiked the Sarvis Creek trail in the southern part of the county and was enchanted by all the Mountain Bluebells (Mertensia ciliata ) in bloom along the way. A member of the Boraginaceae (forget- me-not or borage) family, this widely dispersed perennial features a four-foot tall, three-foot wide plant with blue-green leaves that feature fine hairs (hence the name ciliata) and small, bell-shaped flower clusters that start out light blue and become pinkish purple as the flower ages. It’s usually found in wet meadows and along stream banks throughout the western U.S. and is sometimes found as a single plant but often as a whole colony along a stream or wet meadow. It’s an aromatic and beautiful early season flower.\nThe bell-shaped flowers are edible, as are the leaves, but the leaves aren’t very palatable raw with their hairy coating. Native Americans had medicinal uses for this plant.\nAs the weather turns nice, be sure to get out and see all the early-season wildflowers our part of the mountains feature during this short blooming season.\nDeb Babcock is a volunteer Master Gardener through the CSU Extension Routt County.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Steamboat and Routt County make the Steamboat Pilot & Today’s work possible.

Seen in almost every farm house's yard where I grew up. They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms. I love having useful plants in the yard. How about you? per the Peterson Field Guide - Edible Wild Plants:\nOn identifying the edible day-lily \"Note the unspotted tawny blossoms (open 1 day only) facing upward from the top of a leafless flowerstalk. Basal leaves light green, long, swordlike. Root a tangle of small elongated tubers.\"\n\nCarnation petals has been long used to make liqueur called Chartreuse by monks in the early 18th century.

Those who escaped could find themselves in an survival situation that called for finding wild food. Often, Native American children were taught about edible plants from a young age. Most people today haven't had the same learning experience, and most people are likely to fail at finding wild food. You have to have to know how to correctly identify plants, and where they grow, and finally which parts of the plants are edible. You also have to know where to look for certain foods like mosses, nuts, and berries, and more calorie-rich foods like vegetables (such as potatoes and other teubers) and even fruit that can grow wildly, depending on your location. Be sure to include include \"Wildman\" Steve Brill's site in your research. Steve is an expert in the field of identifying safe and edible plants in the wild. He is a helpful resource and has designed several programs for organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, garden clubs, or any other group interested in learning more about edible plants. Steve even provides recipes that can be made using plants found in the wild. Surprisingly, there are a lot of options for recipes using edible wild foods and plants. Learning to identify which plants are safe and which are not before the need arises is an important skill to develop. Because this ability is so important, if you find yourself in a desperate situation and are unable to positively identify a food source as safe, the best course of action is to leave it alone. * Contaminated or stagnant water: Plants growing in this environment\nSign Up for our free email newsletter packed with survival tips and tips on preparing for widespread disaster. Topics covered include survival foods, martial law, government collapse, living off the land, self defense, survival hunting, survival fishing, and MORE...\n* Commercial and residential areas: There's a good chance that plants growing in these areas will have been contaminated with dangerous levels of toxic fertilizers and pesticides. (If this is your only option, ensure that you also have a source of clean water and rinse food you feed before eating). Mushrooms: They may look good on the store shelves, but the number and varieties of wild mushrooms that are poisonous or toxic are not worth the risk to your survival. Plants such as poison ivy and related plants grow with leaves that are grouped in threes. You may feel hungry enough to eat a plant that has thorns, but by no means consider them. Bitter tasting plants or those that smell like almonds are best to be avoided. Once you have identified a potential food source, the next step is to determine if the plant is edible. There is a universal edibility test that you can perform on plants to aid in identifying safe plants. 1. Separate the food in question into its basic parts. These include the leaves, roots, stems, buds and flowers (if present). As you are separating the plant, examine it closely for insects and other pests. 2. Crush the plant material (separately) and rub the individual parts on a separate part of your skin. Patience is key in this step as you will need to wait at least eight hours to determine if you develop a negative reaction. If you experience such things as swelling, burning, itching or redness, consider the plant inedible. If your plant passes this test, continue to the next step. 3. Hold the plant to your lips for up to three minutes. If there is no sensation such as itching, burning, or tingling, consider moving to the next step. If such sensations occur, stop here. 4. Taste a small portion of the plant by placing it on your tongue for up to fifteen minutes. Any unexpected and uncomfortable sensations are an indication that you should spit the sample out immediately and seek another source. If you continue to experience no ill effects, continue to the next step. (The actual taste of the sample is not necessarily indicative of its edibility. If you encounter a plant that does not suit your taste, but passes all these steps, it is up to you to decide if it is worth the taste to eat it). 5. Slowly chew the plant in your mouth and without swallowing, hold it in your mouth for another fifteen minutes.\n\nIt痴 Okay to Eat the Lavender Flowers.

Knowing what plants are edible and which ones are not can be the difference between life and death\nIdentifying edible plants\nThe first rule to follow is that if you can’t positively identify a plant, don’t eat it. A plant could be poisonous and if you identify it incorrectly, that could be a bad end. To complicate things, some plants are fine to eat when they are young but become poisonous later on in their growth. Some plants are poisonous during certain seasons. Others just have certain parts of the plants that are poisonous. While some of the plants below will not fit these descriptions, as a general rule of thumb, avoid plants that have:\n• spines, fine hairs or thorns\n• beans, bulbs or seeds inside the pod\n• a grainy head with pink, purple or black spurs\n• a three-leaf growing pattern\nWhere to find edible plants\nIf you are in a humid region, most of the plants will be in sunny areas. If you are in a dry region, the majority of the plants will be found near water sources. It’s a good idea to locate a local plant guidebook and familiarize yourself with it before you go out. You might also consider making it a part of your pack. Wild asparagus is common in many parts of North America, Europe and West Asia.

They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms. I love having useful plants in the yard.

Those who escaped could find themselves in an survival situation that called for finding wild food. Often, Native American children were taught about edible plants from a young age. Most people today haven't had the same learning experience, and most people are likely to fail at finding wild food. You have to have to know how to correctly identify plants, and where they grow, and finally which parts of the plants are edible. You also have to know where to look for certain foods like mosses, nuts, and berries, and more calorie-rich foods like vegetables (such as potatoes and other teubers) and even fruit that can grow wildly, depending on your location. Be sure to include include \"Wildman\" Steve Brill's site in your research. Steve is an expert in the field of identifying safe and edible plants in the wild. He is a helpful resource and has designed several programs for organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, garden clubs, or any other group interested in learning more about edible plants. Steve even provides recipes that can be made using plants found in the wild. Surprisingly, there are a lot of options for recipes using edible wild foods and plants. Learning to identify which plants are safe and which are not before the need arises is an important skill to develop. Because this ability is so important, if you find yourself in a desperate situation and are unable to positively identify a food source as safe, the best course of action is to leave it alone. * Contaminated or stagnant water: Plants growing in this environment\nSign Up for our free email newsletter packed with survival tips and tips on preparing for widespread disaster. Topics covered include survival foods, martial law, government collapse, living off the land, self defense, survival hunting, survival fishing, and MORE...\n* Commercial and residential areas: There's a good chance that plants growing in these areas will have been contaminated with dangerous levels of toxic fertilizers and pesticides. (If this is your only option, ensure that you also have a source of clean water and rinse food you feed before eating). Mushrooms: They may look good on the store shelves, but the number and varieties of wild mushrooms that are poisonous or toxic are not worth the risk to your survival. Plants such as poison ivy and related plants grow with leaves that are grouped in threes. You may feel hungry enough to eat a plant that has thorns, but by no means consider them. Bitter tasting plants or those that smell like almonds are best to be avoided. Once you have identified a potential food source, the next step is to determine if the plant is edible. There is a universal edibility test that you can perform on plants to aid in identifying safe plants. 1. Separate the food in question into its basic parts. These include the leaves, roots, stems, buds and flowers (if present). As you are separating the plant, examine it closely for insects and other pests. 2. Crush the plant material (separately) and rub the individual parts on a separate part of your skin. Patience is key in this step as you will need to wait at least eight hours to determine if you develop a negative reaction. If you experience such things as swelling, burning, itching or redness, consider the plant inedible. If your plant passes this test, continue to the next step. 3. Hold the plant to your lips for up to three minutes. If there is no sensation such as itching, burning, or tingling, consider moving to the next step. If such sensations occur, stop here. 4. Taste a small portion of the plant by placing it on your tongue for up to fifteen minutes. Any unexpected and uncomfortable sensations are an indication that you should spit the sample out immediately and seek another source. If you continue to experience no ill effects, continue to the next step. (The actual taste of the sample is not necessarily indicative of its edibility. If you encounter a plant that does not suit your taste, but passes all these steps, it is up to you to decide if it is worth the taste to eat it). 5. Slowly chew the plant in your mouth and without swallowing, hold it in your mouth for another fifteen minutes.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:01b3c480-5c40-4caa-be85-842e70a067d5>"]},{"passage":"It痴 Okay to Eat the Lavender Flowers.

Knowing what plants are edible and which ones are not can be the difference between life and death\nIdentifying edible plants\nThe first rule to follow is that if you can’t positively identify a plant, don’t eat it. A plant could be poisonous and if you identify it incorrectly, that could be a bad end. To complicate things, some plants are fine to eat when they are young but become poisonous later on in their growth. Some plants are poisonous during certain seasons. Others just have certain parts of the plants that are poisonous. While some of the plants below will not fit these descriptions, as a general rule of thumb, avoid plants that have:\n• spines, fine hairs or thorns\n• beans, bulbs or seeds inside the pod\n• a grainy head with pink, purple or black spurs\n• a three-leaf growing pattern\nWhere to find edible plants\nIf you are in a humid region, most of the plants will be in sunny areas. If you are in a dry region, the majority of the plants will be found near water sources. It’s a good idea to locate a local plant guidebook and familiarize yourself with it before you go out. You might also consider making it a part of your pack. Wild asparagus is common in many parts of North America, Europe and West Asia. It is very similar to asparagus that you find in your grocery store but has a lot thinner stalk. It typically resembles a cluster of green fingers. The mature plant is fern-like with red berries. The plant's flowers are small and green in color. Wild asparagus is most common between March and June. It is a great source of Vitamin C, thiamine and potassium. You can eat it raw or boil it. You'll most likely find it along ditches, fields, fences or at the base of ferns. These plants are known as cattails or punks in North America. They are known as bullrush or reedmace in Europe. They are typically found near freshwater rivers and ponds. They are tall plants that have a brown or bright yellow hot dog-shaped flower on the end. Most of the plant itself is edible. The best part of the plant is the stem near the bottom where the stalk is white. You can boil or eat them stem raw. Boil the leaves to eat them. If you want to eat the hot dog-looking part of the plant, you need to get it at the right time. The roots specifically, are very good sources of Vitamins A and B\nLucky for you, clovers are edible! They are typically found in an open grassy area and are better when boiled. It's best to eat the blossoms, but don't eat the brown blossoms. You'll want young and fresh white, pink or red ones. The leaves are also edible however, you'll want to look for young ones. The younger leaves are digestible raw in small amounts - half a cup or so. Older leaves will need to be cooked. You should be warned too that you'll never want to eat fermented clover leaves and clovers in warm climates can produce small amounts of cyanide so be careful. The chickweed is most common in temperate and arctic zones. The leaves are pretty thick and usually have small white flowers on the head. They are most common between May and July. Chickweed is very high in many vitamins and minerals. You can eat the leaves raw or boiled. The chickweed has a poisonous look-alike called spotted spurge. It grows close to the ground and can can even grow side by side with chickweed. Spurge exudes an acrid, white, milky sap when the leaves are cut. Chickweed does not. It should be pretty easy to identify dandelions. They are the ones that keep popping up in your perfect lawn! Your kids use them to draw with. Dandelion leaves have jagged edges, grow close to the ground and typically grow in bright areas.The great thing about them though is that they are entirely edible. You can eat the leaves while they are still young. The mature leaves aren’t bad but they will taste bitter. To get rid of the bitter taste, you can boil the leaves. You can also boil the roots before eating.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f345a20f-afed-46e9-b6aa-0c37912d9413>"]}]}

The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nWednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).\n\nHis revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]\n\nThe trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAs both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole\n\nFrank Sinatra transformed popular music. Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.\n\n1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.\n\nWhat you'll hear:\n- How to initially assess a unique career idea to determine if it's likely to \"work\"\n- The #1 thing you need to START doing if you truly want to evolve both classical music AND your career\n- Why moving classical music into a different venue (i.e. a bar or club) is backwards thinking\n- The biggest thing standing in the way of the evolution of classical music (hint: it's not the music\n...and much more\n\nMusical artists ash riser “i’m not a rapper i’m not a producer i’m not a singer i’m an artist” is how versatile musician, ash riser, describes himself.

His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"Wednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles.

Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"The trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"As both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a7d90d7a-e28b-42cb-bb62-f2909c66dde1>"]},{"passage":"Frank Sinatra transformed popular music. Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5e43fe16-7b97-4355-96c0-ec2306310b8b>"]},{"passage":"1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f7ffb6af-5c48-4ad8-902e-4329f2a11116>"]},{"passage":"During the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e580519a-3e8b-42e9-8ae8-b97481ceabcf>"]},{"passage":"What you'll hear:\n- How to initially assess a unique career idea to determine if it's likely to \"work\"\n- The #1 thing you need to START doing if you truly want to evolve both classical music AND your career\n- Why moving classical music into a different venue (i.e. a bar or club) is backwards thinking\n- The biggest thing standing in the way of the evolution of classical music (hint: it's not the music\n...and much more","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:28f1de08-6f90-4b37-9878-bc9bd86d97dc>"]},{"passage":"Musical artists ash riser “i’m not a rapper i’m not a producer i’m not a singer i’m an artist” is how versatile musician, ash riser, describes himself.

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.\n\n\"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\" Our Music Department is founded on the belief that all students are musicians, they just need to find their musical voice, whether it is through singing or an instrument, composing their own music, exploring elements of music technology or sharing their own interpretations of the music they hear.Our curriculum covers a range of skills and styles, providing the opportunity for the less-experienced to discover what music really is, while still challenging those who have been studying an instrument for many years. All topics include some elements of listening, performing and composing, and all students are expected to be familiar with basic music notation by the end of Year 5. The majority of learning is done through practical tasks as the more explicit, intensive study of music history and theory can be found in the exam years. We encourage all students to remember that being ‘musical’ is not simply about learning an instrument. It involves a range of skills that can be developed through regular practice. - Early Years and Pre-Prep\n- Senior School\n- Sixth Form\n- Outside the Classroom\n- Individual Instrumental and Singing Lessons\nStudents engage in music learning from the very beginning of their Harrow journey. The first steps involve a variety of games to develop their co-ordination skills and engage their imaginations. As their journey progresses they are introduced to a variety of instruments and have the opportunity to explore different sounds. This continues as they progress through Pre-Prep, with increasing levels of musical vocabulary and the introduction of music notation. Students develop greater independence through their time in Prep, with an increasing emphasis on group work and research-influenced performing and composing. Students also have the opportunity to work with instrumental teachers during this time, for example through group lessons of guitars and wind instruments in Year 8. Students in Prep use an increasing amount of technology, particularly Garageband, to widen their skill base. Students in Year 9 continue to develop their understanding through group work and class discussion, using more complex vocabulary and making more complex connections between pieces and styles. They also learn to use Sibelius software at this stage.In Years 10 and 11, the CIE GCSE course is equipped to develop the musical skills of each student, with the final result being derived from coursework (30% performing and 30% composing) and a general listening exam (40%). The CIE AS\/A2 course combines musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, composing, performing as well as looking at music and musicians from a wider context. Students study a selection of contrasting set works from the Classical Period as well as a topic of ‘Picturing Music’. They also have options regarding the amount of performing and composing they do, opening the A-level to a wider range of students. At A2, students do not take a final exam. They may choose either a performing or composing option, along with an investigative report. We offer a wide ranging extra-curricular music programme, both during Enrichment Activity slots and also lunchtimes. Students of all ages and abilities can find something to engage their musical skills. These feed into the whole school concerts, which take place at Christmas and in the late spring. Students are also encouraged and supported in setting up their own ensembles and have many opportunities to demonstrate their skills throughout the year. As a member of FOBISIA, we have taken part in a number of their festivals, including the Primary Carnival, and acting as hosts for the older students’ Music Festival. Our older students also perform in the wider community, particularly at Christmas where they have become a fixture at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Christmas celebrations. - Pre-Prep Singers (Years 2-5)\n- Show Choir (Years 6-13)\n- Apri Canentes (Years 10-13 audition only)\n- Staff Choir\n- String Group\n- Chinese Drumming\n- Flute Choir (lunchtime activity)\n- Guitar Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Reed Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Ukulele Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Pre-Prep Pans (lunchtime activity)\n- Steelers (Year 6 – 9, beginner to intermediate steel pans)\n- Pantastic (Years 7 – 13 advanced steel pans)\nWe also offer individual 30 minute lessons on a wide variety of instruments.

Such musical feeding of the spirit remains an important part of my own early memories. That transcendent sense of well-being and connection with something beyond the day-by-day experience of the world could be sensed in the humblest musical activities: in nursery rhymes and singing games, in hymns and songs and in listening to music of all kinds through mechanical reproduction. I had a familial and environmental disposition towards music and was lucky enough to experience music at first-hand as well as in audience. As a youth I felt impelled to study music even though I had little formal teaching and less hope of success. Can anything helpful be learned from that I wonder? I cannot demonstrate how much musical experience, in the home and outside, helped my studies overall but I am sure it did. I know it was my solace when things went wrong for me and that it helped me to learn to co-ordinate and develop my thinking and feeling processes, but I cannot prove it. I believe that youthful musical experience develops the brain, and there is increasing scientific evidence of positive effect, such as the evidence on brain development in musicians published in 1995 by Schlaug et al. and in 1998 by Pantev et al. in Nature. What I think my story does underline is the importance of real musical experience in early life. It was hearing a busker on a street corner playing a popular song on the violin that first inspired me to want to try to play a musical instrument. At that age everything in music seemed equally wonderful and important to me. I loved hearing brass bands, choirs and organs, salon music, popular songs (there was no 'pop' music as such), dance and big bands, folk songs, Gilbert and Sullivan, Victorian sentimental ballads, live concerts of Britten's music (I came from the same region as he did), orchestras and jazz bands. Formal school music education did not figure much in my early life and neither did I have many individual instrumental lessons. Most of what little I received I rejected as boring and irrelevant. Perhaps I was motivated to teach because I felt deprived of being taught well. But it has also made me healthily sceptical of the intentional effect that any individual teacher can have. Music doesn't fit easily into the timetabled security of school-life. It is an art and arts are uncomfortable, anarchic things. Arts demand time and attention and encourage individual expression. Good music teachers respond to this by finding ways to provide captivating musical experiences in spite of the mechanisms of schools. They understand the power of music and the need for it to be able to speak for itself rather than be explained. However much they plan carefully, they expect the unexpected and allow the music to work its own magic. They note the fundamental experience of music that comes through the human voice and how this underlies common musical practice in all cultures and at all time. They don't give up on this and diligently search for new vocal materials that will engage, thrill and motivate young people. Helping pupils to find themselves through learning to play an instrument is a vital part of providing a musical environment in which pupils can learn. In some countries this can be done in school time, in others it may be through local music schools. Good teachers remain keenly aware of their individual pupils' instrumental and vocal progress and capabilities and make endless opportunities for their skills to be nurtured and developed within the school. Another way of experiencing music is by composing music of your own. Good teachers encourage inventiveness in their pupils and help them to approach musical experience with the invitation to try creating it for themselves. They provide rich opportunities for pupils to hear and experience the effect of their own compositions when it communicates with others in performance. The question \"what if….? \" is fundamental to all good music teaching both in the classroom and in the music studio. Good teachers keep their ears and eyes open and are always ready to test out new musical experiences to find the value in them. They share their sense of discovery and enjoyment with their pupils and make certain that their own enthusiasms and knowledge are conveyed to their pupils through making music with them whenever possible but encouraging all of them to take responsibility for their own learning. Music is one of our earliest sensory experiences. It can be identified by babies even before birth.\n\nThis week I spent a really interesting morning leading a workshop for Trinity College London and Music For Youth with a group of experienced music education sector folk to look at mentoring and feedback. There were 2 specific aims of the session. To identify what the terms “inclusivity and diversity” mean in the context of assessment and feeedback and the second was about how our own musical identity and musical journey can influence how and what we feed back. We started by taking it in turns to share the journey that had brought each of us to that room on that day. What came across was a very real drive to want to give young people similar musical opportunities and musical experiences to those that we had all been part of. Common themes and shared pathways emerged, and for some there were emotional moments as people recalled events or experiences along the way that had had a very memorable impact on them. It seems that the ‘first access’ to music that all of us in the room had encountered that started us on our musical journey or pathway was one of the following:\n- at primary school\n- inspired by a musical family or family member\n- as a result of music happening in the local community\nThe next step for most of us was to then become involved with the county music service in some way, usually to play as part of an ensemble. All of us had been teachers or composers or performers of music at some point in our careers. For some, although it was primary music that hooked them in, secondary school music hadn’t been of particular relevance (not the case for me, but definitely a theme in discussion). It was at that point that the musical pathway seemed to divert to routes that existed outside of school. Perhaps those of us who took part in that session are very much products of the music education focus, structures and values that were prevalent during the times that we came through the system. Perhaps we just followed clearly defined pathways that were laid out for those of us that happened to find ourselves on the first step no matter what it was that helped us to take that step. I left the session wondering whether those same pathways to and through music education still exist. And if they don’t, whether we have been successful in replacing them with new ones. Should we be looking for musical pathways that accommodate new ways of learning, tools to help us to be creative, different ways of hearing and making music and a range of approaches embedded in structures that underpin a completely musical education? All of this sits within a shifting educational landscape in the UK which threatens arts and cultural education in ways that I would have found it hard to imagine back in the days when the photograph at the top of this post was taken. And so to part of my story. When I was in Year 6 in my tiny village primary school where music was the life and soul of every day, we wrote, performed and recorded our own ‘Masque’, supported by our teachers. All of the top classes were involved with the drama, words, lyrics, music, costumes, scenery and it occupied months of planning and creating and rehearsing and presenting (no SATs to prep for in those days!) until eventually we found out we had won a national competition to perform ours at the Royal Opera House in London. I played a recorder solo that my best friend had composed and that the whole class had devised words and a melody to fit with. There was no question that after a primary school ‘first access’ musical experience that ended like that I would continue with music. I learned to play the clarinet (paid for by my parents), attended a music centre every week, I went to a secondary school with an incredible music department, symphony orchestra and concert band, I was part of the County ensembles and that pathway led me to a music degree and into music teaching and beyond. My musical pathway was clearly laid out (for me) in front of me and I followed it. So my thinking this week has been about whether those pathways still exist and if so are they still the most relevant ones that can truly embrace inclusivity and diversity, whatever that means in the context of where and how we are working? If not then what might replace them? Is it time to refresh the old and embrace the new and if so, then how can we do that when the experience of so many now running the show was so much ‘of its time’? My worry is that if we can’t find a shared vision and approach and set aside our own musical identities in order to embrace those of others to make this possible, then we risk the vibrancy and creativity and excitement of music making being lost to many.\n\nI believe it is important for music learning and musical journey to be individual and personal, therefore, I also believe it is my responsibility as an educator to create a learning environment that allows students opportunities to create and reflect on their musical experience. My teaching philosophy is based on the plant and growth analogy, but I try to take it beyond watering. In addition to watering needs, every plant has specific sunlight, soil, fertilizer, and humidity needs. As such, you can not treat every plant exactly the same and expect them to thrive. I believe the same applies to students. I like to present my teaching ideas in multiple ways to allow students to choose the way that works best for them. What worked for me may not work for 75% of the students in my class. This philosophy based on individualization allows students to develop that all important, personal relationship with music. It was one or two teachers that made me connect with music that led me down this path of music study and therefore I hope to inspire the same love in my students. In addition to grasping the personal aspects of music, I am also well aware of the ethical and the administrative tasks that are tied with having a program. When I taught at the University of Tennessee as a graduate student, I had a couple cases where I needed to be in contact with the Title 9 office as well as the head of the school to address sensitive issues. While I hope to never deal with these issues again, I am comfortable speaking to the necessary people to follow protocol on these issues as well as others that could arise. Students will benefit from my instruction because they will get to choose their own journey in music, so to speak. We may all be learning the same song, but I hope and encourage students to make connections from the music to their own lives. As such, students will have chances to begin to develop their own philosophies about music and how they see the world. This is also be influenced by the diverse music presented to them.\n\nI would teach children music, physics and philosophy: but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning. (Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods. Music complements the vision and core values of Greengate Lane Academy. Our belief is that the Greengate Lane school values are weaved throughout our curriculum to support our pupils and our school community, our Music lessons are structured as follows:\n- SCHOLARSHIP: our music curriculum allows our children to be scholarly, they are taught the subject in depth, progressively building on prior knowledge, resulting in children remembering more and being able to articulate what that have learnt. - CURIOUSITY: music lessons encourage pupils to contribute through discussion and collaboration; pupils reflect on their own ideas and those of others, they are encouraged to ask questions and be curious. - TENACITY: the music curriculum encourages pupil to overcome challenges and learn about how to continually improve on their musical compositions based off of the opinions and advice of their peers. - ASPIRATIONAL: pupils are given the opportunity to perform their compositions to the rest of the school and at whole school events, which they will work on to perfect for extended periods of time\n- KINDNESS: lessons are structured so that children learn skills together and support each other in partner work. Our curriculum drivers (vocabulary acquisition, SMSC, cultural awareness) are at the heart of all our music lessons:\nVOCABULARY ACQUSITION: children are continually introduced to new, subject specific vocabulary which they are encouraged to use regularly. SMSC: children are introduced to many different musical genres and encouraged to appraise these, forming opinions on what they like, dislike and appreciate the composition and creativity of the music they are surrounded by. CUTLURAL AWARENESS: as part of the music curriculum, children are introduced to music from a variety of different cultures and time periods, whilst being encouraged to analyse the similarities and differences these have from each other. At Greengate Lane Academy, we teach music through the Charanga scheme. The scheme provides teachers with carefully sequenced week-by-week lessons for each year group in the school, from ages 5–11. It has lesson plans, assessment, clear progression, and engaging and exciting whiteboard resources for every lesson. The Scheme supports all the requirements of the national curriculum and is in line with published Ofsted guidance. In EYFS children will focus on:\n- Listening and Responding\n- Exploring and Creating Singing\n- Sharing and Performing\nIn Key Stage 1 and 2 children will focus on:\n- Listening and appraising\n- Musical activities (games, singing, playing instruments, improvisation, composition)\n- Performing and Sharing\nThese are taught across the school; learning deepens and broadens in each year group. Lessons are delivered by class teachers to their own classes each week in order to teach the required knowledge and skills in a developmental and age-appropriate way. In addition to this, in Year 4\/5 the children have the opportunity to learn Samba Drumming with a specialist teacher. Impact of the Curriculum\nIn music, teachers assess pupils’ learning in lessons and adapt their teaching to be responsive to pupils understanding. As the curriculum progresses it is increasingly more challenging and pupils have the opportunity to review and extend their understanding over time as well as combine and apply different aspects of knowledge an skills development.\n\nWhy should I study Music Experience? Music Experience is a subject that will allow you to increase your knowledge and understanding of music. It will help you to develop skills with music theory and practice. If you love listening to music and want to understand more about how music works, and learn how to create your own original music and perform music, Music Experience will help you to develop these skills. Please note that Music Experience is not a course of instrumental tuition, and you need to already have some knowledge of how to play an instrument or sing before you enrol in this subject. You cannot learn to play an instrument through doing this subject. Where does Music Experience lead? Music Experience will help you to develop the foundations for further study in music. It will give you experience in performance and writing original music as well as critically analysing music, and you can use this knowledge to do further music study or work towards a career in the music industry. What work will I do in Music Experience? Music Experience is based on understanding music, responding to music, and creating music. In understanding music, you will develop critical listening skills and learn the vocabulary to discuss music and analyse it in detail. Responding to music gives you the opportunity to learn from the artists who inspire you. Creating music has two main parts – performance and composition. You will be assessed on a music performance, so to do this subject you need to be able to play an instrument or sing. Composition means you will write your own music, so this is a very creative part of the course. Music writing is done using software so you do not need to know how to read music to create something original and inspiring. What do other students think about Music Experience? Stage 1 Music Experience really helped me get my basics for music theory down, and I had a great time making music on GarageBand which has led me to want to study a Diploma of Music Industry (Sound Production) after year 12.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nI really enjoyed learning to use software, being creative with songs, and doing a performance because it helped me to improve my skills.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nWhere can I find more information about Music Experience? For more detail about content and assessment, view the course information:\n- Stage 1 (Year 11)\nWho teaches Music Experience?\n\nThere is much to recommend developing our students into independent and engaged students. The two are related: engaged students go beyond what is asked or required, and generate their own questions that drive their learning. By contrast, dependent students are often compliant, but not engaged. It is easy to settle for a compliant student, even though it is only through engagement that a student will meet appropriately rigorous educational goals. Compliant students are the “ones who follow directions, diligently complete assignments, and get good grades mostly because of their effort or adherence to directions. They do the work because it’s assigned, not because they find it interesting or relevant” (Jackson and Zmuda, 2014). There is a good chance that many teachers were themselves compliant teachers, and because they achieved career goals by being compliant in school, they have come to believe that being a compliant student is the way to success. From a teacher’s point of view, compliant students are easy to teach, and because they score well on tests and projects, they give us the feeling that we have succeeded with them. If our aim is to receive completed work from our students, then these students do indeed represent successes. But if our aim is that students gain learning and experience that will benefit their interactions with our discipline and life in general, then we are probably not measuring success in our classrooms appropriately. There is little chance that a student will retain, use, or in the end benefit from learning he or she has considered uninteresting and irrelevant all along. Music teachers have the luxury of teaching a subject that students are happy to engage in now. There is no need for promising a future return on studying math or science, the return comes immediately, making music a potentially relevant subject for most students. Of course there will be later returns as well, as is born out in research on music contributing to building and strengthening neural connections, especially those used for spatial reasoning and language. But students gain much for experience in music right away, and this benefit should be taken full advantage of in our music classes. Here are some keys to helping students become engaged in their work. First, be clear about what you are expecting students to do. Use essential questions and authentic outcomes to design lessons that will engage students. For example, rather than just having students complete a unit on emotions in music, be clear about your expectations by proposing an essential question such as, “How did the composer use the musical elements of pitch, dynamics, and timbre to create scary music? What are alternative ways the composer could have used pitch, dynamics and timbre to create music that was more or less scary? This line of questioning prompts the student to come up with alternatives, and to evaluate on a scale of more or less scary. In both cases the student is practicing both critical and creative thought. The result is a creative product, the revised music, that the student can claim as his or her own, and see as evidence that something tangible and of value has been made out of what the student learned. Second, place the work within a relevant context. Be able to explain to students why it is important for them to be doing what you are asking them to do. Your assignments need to be relevant today, not just in the future. One strategy can be to have students realize their own applications. What will you do with this learning? This not only prompts students to find relevance, but also gives them the opportunity to personalize their own learning. To their relevance, the teacher can add their own. In the example above, knowing how composers use musical elements to express feelings prepares students for creatively expressing their own emotions in a healthy way, through music, and of understanding emotions of others that they have expressed through music. The immediacy of music in our students’ lives makes most musical processes and skills of immediate use to them. The key is to have students use what they have learned, never leaving anything at the “book knowledge” level. Nineteenth century symphonic music is relevant today not only because we still connect with the emotions these composers were expressing in their music, but because the way in which those emotions were expressed reflects the cultural norms of the day, meaning that those emotions can still be expressed today, but with the cultural norms of our day. There is a connection made between people across time in the commonality of human emotional experience, and in discovering how that experience is continued through centuries across changing and changed genres and styles of music. Third, create a supportive classroom culture.","passages":[{"passage":"On Monday, July 31 we were treated to a performance by the Endeavour College Year 9 band.

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ecc683c5-0d44-4e7e-86fb-78777a89eb47>"]},{"passage":"\"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\" Our Music Department is founded on the belief that all students are musicians, they just need to find their musical voice, whether it is through singing or an instrument, composing their own music, exploring elements of music technology or sharing their own interpretations of the music they hear.Our curriculum covers a range of skills and styles, providing the opportunity for the less-experienced to discover what music really is, while still challenging those who have been studying an instrument for many years. All topics include some elements of listening, performing and composing, and all students are expected to be familiar with basic music notation by the end of Year 5. The majority of learning is done through practical tasks as the more explicit, intensive study of music history and theory can be found in the exam years. We encourage all students to remember that being ‘musical’ is not simply about learning an instrument. It involves a range of skills that can be developed through regular practice. - Early Years and Pre-Prep\n- Senior School\n- Sixth Form\n- Outside the Classroom\n- Individual Instrumental and Singing Lessons\nStudents engage in music learning from the very beginning of their Harrow journey. The first steps involve a variety of games to develop their co-ordination skills and engage their imaginations. As their journey progresses they are introduced to a variety of instruments and have the opportunity to explore different sounds. This continues as they progress through Pre-Prep, with increasing levels of musical vocabulary and the introduction of music notation. Students develop greater independence through their time in Prep, with an increasing emphasis on group work and research-influenced performing and composing. Students also have the opportunity to work with instrumental teachers during this time, for example through group lessons of guitars and wind instruments in Year 8. Students in Prep use an increasing amount of technology, particularly Garageband, to widen their skill base. Students in Year 9 continue to develop their understanding through group work and class discussion, using more complex vocabulary and making more complex connections between pieces and styles. They also learn to use Sibelius software at this stage.In Years 10 and 11, the CIE GCSE course is equipped to develop the musical skills of each student, with the final result being derived from coursework (30% performing and 30% composing) and a general listening exam (40%). The CIE AS\/A2 course combines musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, composing, performing as well as looking at music and musicians from a wider context. Students study a selection of contrasting set works from the Classical Period as well as a topic of ‘Picturing Music’.

Such musical feeding of the spirit remains an important part of my own early memories. That transcendent sense of well-being and connection with something beyond the day-by-day experience of the world could be sensed in the humblest musical activities: in nursery rhymes and singing games, in hymns and songs and in listening to music of all kinds through mechanical reproduction. I had a familial and environmental disposition towards music and was lucky enough to experience music at first-hand as well as in audience. As a youth I felt impelled to study music even though I had little formal teaching and less hope of success. Can anything helpful be learned from that I wonder?

I believe that youthful musical experience develops the brain, and there is increasing scientific evidence of positive effect, such as the evidence on brain development in musicians published in 1995 by Schlaug et al. and in 1998 by Pantev et al. in Nature. What I think my story does underline is the importance of real musical experience in early life. It was hearing a busker on a street corner playing a popular song on the violin that first inspired me to want to try to play a musical instrument. At that age everything in music seemed equally wonderful and important to me. I loved hearing brass bands, choirs and organs, salon music, popular songs (there was no 'pop' music as such), dance and big bands, folk songs, Gilbert and Sullivan, Victorian sentimental ballads, live concerts of Britten's music (I came from the same region as he did), orchestras and jazz bands. Formal school music education did not figure much in my early life and neither did I have many individual instrumental lessons. Most of what little I received I rejected as boring and irrelevant. Perhaps I was motivated to teach because I felt deprived of being taught well. But it has also made me healthily sceptical of the intentional effect that any individual teacher can have. Music doesn't fit easily into the timetabled security of school-life. It is an art and arts are uncomfortable, anarchic things. Arts demand time and attention and encourage individual expression. Good music teachers respond to this by finding ways to provide captivating musical experiences in spite of the mechanisms of schools. They understand the power of music and the need for it to be able to speak for itself rather than be explained. However much they plan carefully, they expect the unexpected and allow the music to work its own magic. They note the fundamental experience of music that comes through the human voice and how this underlies common musical practice in all cultures and at all time. They don't give up on this and diligently search for new vocal materials that will engage, thrill and motivate young people. Helping pupils to find themselves through learning to play an instrument is a vital part of providing a musical environment in which pupils can learn. In some countries this can be done in school time, in others it may be through local music schools. Good teachers remain keenly aware of their individual pupils' instrumental and vocal progress and capabilities and make endless opportunities for their skills to be nurtured and developed within the school. Another way of experiencing music is by composing music of your own. Good teachers encourage inventiveness in their pupils and help them to approach musical experience with the invitation to try creating it for themselves. They provide rich opportunities for pupils to hear and experience the effect of their own compositions when it communicates with others in performance. The question \"what if….? \" is fundamental to all good music teaching both in the classroom and in the music studio. Good teachers keep their ears and eyes open and are always ready to test out new musical experiences to find the value in them. They share their sense of discovery and enjoyment with their pupils and make certain that their own enthusiasms and knowledge are conveyed to their pupils through making music with them whenever possible but encouraging all of them to take responsibility for their own learning. Music is one of our earliest sensory experiences. It can be identified by babies even before birth.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a3d1e9bc-2e8c-4b3c-89af-128d001ec4a3>"]},{"passage":"This week I spent a really interesting morning leading a workshop for Trinity College London and Music For Youth with a group of experienced music education sector folk to look at mentoring and feedback. There were 2 specific aims of the session. To identify what the terms “inclusivity and diversity” mean in the context of assessment and feeedback and the second was about how our own musical identity and musical journey can influence how and what we feed back. We started by taking it in turns to share the journey that had brought each of us to that room on that day. What came across was a very real drive to want to give young people similar musical opportunities and musical experiences to those that we had all been part of. Common themes and shared pathways emerged, and for some there were emotional moments as people recalled events or experiences along the way that had had a very memorable impact on them. It seems that the ‘first access’ to music that all of us in the room had encountered that started us on our musical journey or pathway was one of the following:\n- at primary school\n- inspired by a musical family or family member\n- as a result of music happening in the local community\nThe next step for most of us was to then become involved with the county music service in some way, usually to play as part of an ensemble. All of us had been teachers or composers or performers of music at some point in our careers. For some, although it was primary music that hooked them in, secondary school music hadn’t been of particular relevance (not the case for me, but definitely a theme in discussion). It was at that point that the musical pathway seemed to divert to routes that existed outside of school. Perhaps those of us who took part in that session are very much products of the music education focus, structures and values that were prevalent during the times that we came through the system. Perhaps we just followed clearly defined pathways that were laid out for those of us that happened to find ourselves on the first step no matter what it was that helped us to take that step. I left the session wondering whether those same pathways to and through music education still exist. And if they don’t, whether we have been successful in replacing them with new ones. Should we be looking for musical pathways that accommodate new ways of learning, tools to help us to be creative, different ways of hearing and making music and a range of approaches embedded in structures that underpin a completely musical education? All of this sits within a shifting educational landscape in the UK which threatens arts and cultural education in ways that I would have found it hard to imagine back in the days when the photograph at the top of this post was taken. And so to part of my story. When I was in Year 6 in my tiny village primary school where music was the life and soul of every day, we wrote, performed and recorded our own ‘Masque’, supported by our teachers. All of the top classes were involved with the drama, words, lyrics, music, costumes, scenery and it occupied months of planning and creating and rehearsing and presenting (no SATs to prep for in those days!) until eventually we found out we had won a national competition to perform ours at the Royal Opera House in London. I played a recorder solo that my best friend had composed and that the whole class had devised words and a melody to fit with. There was no question that after a primary school ‘first access’ musical experience that ended like that I would continue with music. I learned to play the clarinet (paid for by my parents), attended a music centre every week, I went to a secondary school with an incredible music department, symphony orchestra and concert band, I was part of the County ensembles and that pathway led me to a music degree and into music teaching and beyond. My musical pathway was clearly laid out (for me) in front of me and I followed it. So my thinking this week has been about whether those pathways still exist and if so are they still the most relevant ones that can truly embrace inclusivity and diversity, whatever that means in the context of where and how we are working? If not then what might replace them? Is it time to refresh the old and embrace the new and if so, then how can we do that when the experience of so many now running the show was so much ‘of its time’? My worry is that if we can’t find a shared vision and approach and set aside our own musical identities in order to embrace those of others to make this possible, then we risk the vibrancy and creativity and excitement of music making being lost to many.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fcf50626-74c5-49fd-bafe-ff5321688d5a>"]},{"passage":"I believe it is important for music learning and musical journey to be individual and personal, therefore, I also believe it is my responsibility as an educator to create a learning environment that allows students opportunities to create and reflect on their musical experience. My teaching philosophy is based on the plant and growth analogy, but I try to take it beyond watering. In addition to watering needs, every plant has specific sunlight, soil, fertilizer, and humidity needs. As such, you can not treat every plant exactly the same and expect them to thrive. I believe the same applies to students. I like to present my teaching ideas in multiple ways to allow students to choose the way that works best for them. What worked for me may not work for 75% of the students in my class. This philosophy based on individualization allows students to develop that all important, personal relationship with music. It was one or two teachers that made me connect with music that led me down this path of music study and therefore I hope to inspire the same love in my students. In addition to grasping the personal aspects of music, I am also well aware of the ethical and the administrative tasks that are tied with having a program. When I taught at the University of Tennessee as a graduate student, I had a couple cases where I needed to be in contact with the Title 9 office as well as the head of the school to address sensitive issues. While I hope to never deal with these issues again, I am comfortable speaking to the necessary people to follow protocol on these issues as well as others that could arise. Students will benefit from my instruction because they will get to choose their own journey in music, so to speak. We may all be learning the same song, but I hope and encourage students to make connections from the music to their own lives. As such, students will have chances to begin to develop their own philosophies about music and how they see the world. This is also be influenced by the diverse music presented to them.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:48dd1a74-c45b-438e-8654-c977a68c6d79>"]},{"passage":"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy: but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning. (Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods. Music complements the vision and core values of Greengate Lane Academy. Our belief is that the Greengate Lane school values are weaved throughout our curriculum to support our pupils and our school community, our Music lessons are structured as follows:\n- SCHOLARSHIP: our music curriculum allows our children to be scholarly, they are taught the subject in depth, progressively building on prior knowledge, resulting in children remembering more and being able to articulate what that have learnt. - CURIOUSITY: music lessons encourage pupils to contribute through discussion and collaboration; pupils reflect on their own ideas and those of others, they are encouraged to ask questions and be curious. - TENACITY: the music curriculum encourages pupil to overcome challenges and learn about how to continually improve on their musical compositions based off of the opinions and advice of their peers. - ASPIRATIONAL: pupils are given the opportunity to perform their compositions to the rest of the school and at whole school events, which they will work on to perfect for extended periods of time\n- KINDNESS: lessons are structured so that children learn skills together and support each other in partner work. Our curriculum drivers (vocabulary acquisition, SMSC, cultural awareness) are at the heart of all our music lessons:\nVOCABULARY ACQUSITION: children are continually introduced to new, subject specific vocabulary which they are encouraged to use regularly. SMSC: children are introduced to many different musical genres and encouraged to appraise these, forming opinions on what they like, dislike and appreciate the composition and creativity of the music they are surrounded by. CUTLURAL AWARENESS: as part of the music curriculum, children are introduced to music from a variety of different cultures and time periods, whilst being encouraged to analyse the similarities and differences these have from each other. At Greengate Lane Academy, we teach music through the Charanga scheme. The scheme provides teachers with carefully sequenced week-by-week lessons for each year group in the school, from ages 5–11. It has lesson plans, assessment, clear progression, and engaging and exciting whiteboard resources for every lesson. The Scheme supports all the requirements of the national curriculum and is in line with published Ofsted guidance. In EYFS children will focus on:\n- Listening and Responding\n- Exploring and Creating Singing\n- Sharing and Performing\nIn Key Stage 1 and 2 children will focus on:\n- Listening and appraising\n- Musical activities (games, singing, playing instruments, improvisation, composition)\n- Performing and Sharing\nThese are taught across the school; learning deepens and broadens in each year group. Lessons are delivered by class teachers to their own classes each week in order to teach the required knowledge and skills in a developmental and age-appropriate way. In addition to this, in Year 4\/5 the children have the opportunity to learn Samba Drumming with a specialist teacher. Impact of the Curriculum\nIn music, teachers assess pupils’ learning in lessons and adapt their teaching to be responsive to pupils understanding. As the curriculum progresses it is increasingly more challenging and pupils have the opportunity to review and extend their understanding over time as well as combine and apply different aspects of knowledge an skills development.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c2d5d4e8-2807-4a22-ae7c-cdd39f01e14a>"]},{"passage":"Why should I study Music Experience? Music Experience is a subject that will allow you to increase your knowledge and understanding of music. It will help you to develop skills with music theory and practice. If you love listening to music and want to understand more about how music works, and learn how to create your own original music and perform music, Music Experience will help you to develop these skills. Please note that Music Experience is not a course of instrumental tuition, and you need to already have some knowledge of how to play an instrument or sing before you enrol in this subject. You cannot learn to play an instrument through doing this subject. Where does Music Experience lead? Music Experience will help you to develop the foundations for further study in music. It will give you experience in performance and writing original music as well as critically analysing music, and you can use this knowledge to do further music study or work towards a career in the music industry. What work will I do in Music Experience? Music Experience is based on understanding music, responding to music, and creating music. In understanding music, you will develop critical listening skills and learn the vocabulary to discuss music and analyse it in detail. Responding to music gives you the opportunity to learn from the artists who inspire you. Creating music has two main parts – performance and composition. You will be assessed on a music performance, so to do this subject you need to be able to play an instrument or sing. Composition means you will write your own music, so this is a very creative part of the course. Music writing is done using software so you do not need to know how to read music to create something original and inspiring. What do other students think about Music Experience? Stage 1 Music Experience really helped me get my basics for music theory down, and I had a great time making music on GarageBand which has led me to want to study a Diploma of Music Industry (Sound Production) after year 12.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nI really enjoyed learning to use software, being creative with songs, and doing a performance because it helped me to improve my skills.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nWhere can I find more information about Music Experience?

The two are related: engaged students go beyond what is asked or required, and generate their own questions that drive their learning. By contrast, dependent students are often compliant, but not engaged. It is easy to settle for a compliant student, even though it is only through engagement that a student will meet appropriately rigorous educational goals. Compliant students are the “ones who follow directions, diligently complete assignments, and get good grades mostly because of their effort or adherence to directions. They do the work because it’s assigned, not because they find it interesting or relevant” (Jackson and Zmuda, 2014). There is a good chance that many teachers were themselves compliant teachers, and because they achieved career goals by being compliant in school, they have come to believe that being a compliant student is the way to success. From a teacher’s point of view, compliant students are easy to teach, and because they score well on tests and projects, they give us the feeling that we have succeeded with them. If our aim is to receive completed work from our students, then these students do indeed represent successes. But if our aim is that students gain learning and experience that will benefit their interactions with our discipline and life in general, then we are probably not measuring success in our classrooms appropriately. There is little chance that a student will retain, use, or in the end benefit from learning he or she has considered uninteresting and irrelevant all along. Music teachers have the luxury of teaching a subject that students are happy to engage in now. There is no need for promising a future return on studying math or science, the return comes immediately, making music a potentially relevant subject for most students. Of course there will be later returns as well, as is born out in research on music contributing to building and strengthening neural connections, especially those used for spatial reasoning and language. But students gain much for experience in music right away, and this benefit should be taken full advantage of in our music classes. Here are some keys to helping students become engaged in their work. First, be clear about what you are expecting students to do. Use essential questions and authentic outcomes to design lessons that will engage students. For example, rather than just having students complete a unit on emotions in music, be clear about your expectations by proposing an essential question such as, “How did the composer use the musical elements of pitch, dynamics, and timbre to create scary music? What are alternative ways the composer could have used pitch, dynamics and timbre to create music that was more or less scary? This line of questioning prompts the student to come up with alternatives, and to evaluate on a scale of more or less scary. In both cases the student is practicing both critical and creative thought. The result is a creative product, the revised music, that the student can claim as his or her own, and see as evidence that something tangible and of value has been made out of what the student learned. Second, place the work within a relevant context. Be able to explain to students why it is important for them to be doing what you are asking them to do. Your assignments need to be relevant today, not just in the future. One strategy can be to have students realize their own applications. What will you do with this learning? This not only prompts students to find relevance, but also gives them the opportunity to personalize their own learning. To their relevance, the teacher can add their own. In the example above, knowing how composers use musical elements to express feelings prepares students for creatively expressing their own emotions in a healthy way, through music, and of understanding emotions of others that they have expressed through music. The immediacy of music in our students’ lives makes most musical processes and skills of immediate use to them. The key is to have students use what they have learned, never leaving anything at the “book knowledge” level. Nineteenth century symphonic music is relevant today not only because we still connect with the emotions these composers were expressing in their music, but because the way in which those emotions were expressed reflects the cultural norms of the day, meaning that those emotions can still be expressed today, but with the cultural norms of our day. There is a connection made between people across time in the commonality of human emotional experience, and in discovering how that experience is continued through centuries across changing and changed genres and styles of music. Third, create a supportive classroom culture.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a3855a81-e77c-4104-a9a7-462263ecee29>"]}]}

However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent.\nThroughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret.\nGuilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you.\nGuilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.\nI’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP.\nI think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day.\nJust as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret.\nP.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP.\nLoss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\nAs someone with CP, I’ve felt loss and regret to because of the CP. I felt loss when I realized I had to give up my dream as a kid to become a professional soccer player, and I’ve felt both feelings when I couldn’t participate in something with my friends or felt like an outsider. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate something that has always been there as a part of the CP, and that is my initial perspective on life.\nAs I mentioned above, life with CP is all I know, and all I will know. This has some really good benefits. It means that I won’t always feel the need or desire to be closer to “normal”, simply because I have no idea what it means to not have CP, I can’t really imagine it. This can create some conflicts between the person with CP and their loved ones too. Where the parents for example may want to push their child to exercise more, stretch more, or try harder to walk or walk better, the person with CP, may be content with their functional level as it is, and may not see the point.\nWe both have a responsibility here. The parent should try to understand this, that we don’t necessarily want to be just like an able bodied. Some may, but that may lead to more harm than good. You can’t change the CP; you can’t cure it, at least not right now. And because of that, if you are constantly want something you cannot have, and constantly hating what you have and what you are, you are going to be pretty miserable. Therefore, I would advise you, as a parent to help your child accept their CP rather than fight it. It is not your enemy, nor is it theirs, its a part of them.\nAs people with CP we also have to understand that even if we don’t always see the change the point in stretching or exercises, or even surgeries, we should try to think of the fact that we want to stay happy in the future. The work that you put down now, can be really important later down the road. I used to hate this kind of reasoning however, and I am not expecting you to like it either, so if that doesn’t motivate you, try to find smaller more achievable goals of improvement that you can see in a shorter time period.\nAlso, remember that because your parents want you to exercise more, or walk better or what have you, it doesn’t mean they think you aren’t good enough, you are, and its not about that. They view life from their perspective, and what they have been able to do and enjoy in life, they just want you to feel many of the joys in life that they have, because they love you, not because they don’t think you’re good enough.\nIt is my hope that we can continue to learn from each other, and grow together. That way, we can heal each other and the scars that may open, so I hope you will accept and embrace this open letter as my contribution towards that.\nIf you have had any of these feelings and experiences, either as a parent or as someone with CP, please feel free to comment below and share on your favourite social media, it really helps us grow and write more of these articles!

There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”\n\nEvery person is different and handles situations differently, but hearing for the first time that your child has cerebral palsy is difficult for any parent. “What does this mean for my child?” and “Now what?” are common questions parents ask after learning of the diagnosis. Learning to navigate the numerous medical and community resources can be challenging. Caring for a child with special needs can also be very emotionally difficult and can create stress upon the family. Every county is different in the services offered to children with special needs. It is important to become educated about what services are offered in your area. There are many social workers at Nationwide Children's Hospital who would be happy to help you access all appropriate services for your child. Ask your physician or the nurse to link you with the clinic social worker and she will be happy to help you with any needs or questions that you might have. You can also call the Clinical Services and Care Coordination Department at (614) 722-6300 and ask to speak to a social worker. Finding other parents who are experiencing similar situations can also be very helpful. It is often helpful to talk to someone who understands what you are going through and has gone through similar difficulties. This is also a good way to get “first hand” information on how the system really works and tips on how to navigate the community agencies. The following is a list of community agencies, websites, and literature that can be helpful to you throughout your journey with your child. - To learn more about CP, visit the CDC website. - Find the contact information for your local Help Me Grow. - Find the contact information for your county DODD. - For the current Summer Camp Directory and Family Resource Directory, contact the State Support Team - Region 11 or call (614) 542-4189. Cerebral Palsy Resources\nChildren with cerebral palsy are at risk for learning difficulties or intellectual disability. There are many children with CP, though, who do not have any learning difficulties. There are many resources to help you and your child in this area. One such program is Help Me Grow\/Early Intervention. This is a program for children birth through 3 years who have been identified as having developmental delays or are at risk for being delayed. This is a program that is operated by every county and the services provided vary from county to county. Help Me Grow can help link your child with therapy either in your home or at a therapy center depending upon the resources in your county. You will also be assigned a Help Me Grow Service Coordinator who can help educate you regarding services in your area and also provide you with information on any child development questions you might have. Once your child turns 3, they no longer qualify for Help Me Grow services. Make sure that your Help Me Grow Service Coordinator transitions you to “The Board of Mental Retardation\/Developmental Disabilities” (MRDD) in your county. Along with a Service Coordinator, MRDD has many programs that can help you and your child. When your child turns 3, the school system becomes responsible for providing your child with the appropriate therapies and education your child requires to participate to their full potential in the educational system. Each school system is mandated by law to provide education to children with special needs when they turn 3. Every school system has a special needs preschool program for those children who qualify. Children can be referred to this program by family or professionals. The child will receive a “Multi-Factor Evaluation” (MFE) to determine eligibility. Once the child is deemed eligible for the program, educational goals need to be established for the child. Your child will remain in the special needs preschool until it is time to transition to Kindergarten. The IEP will help make this transition smooth so that the elementary school is aware of your child’s needs and can provide the appropriate accommodations. The parent(s), along with school personnel, meet together to review the results of the MFE and to then develop an “Individualized Education Plan” (IEP). The IEP lists the educational goals for that child for the school year. The preschool program provides all appropriate therapies within the school setting. The IEP is updated every school year, or more often, if the child’s needs change. - Teaching Motor Skills to Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Parents and Professionals, by Sieglinde Martin, M.S., P.T. - Finding A Way: Living with Cerebral Palsy, by Brenda Bilbrey. A children’s book written by someone with CP.\n\nRaising any child is no easy task, and it’s true that it can become even more difficult for parents of children with disabilities. However, CP can vary in severity and therefore require additional care by parents. There is a great deal of support available to families of those with cerebral palsy. These resources range from monetary help to moral support and practical guidance. Simply being able to talk to others who know what you’re going through can help. This means that, while raising a child with CP can be challenging at times, it does not need to be overwhelming. A child with Cerebral Palsy has a limited future. It’s true that people with CP have shorter-than-average life expectancies and that some with more severe forms of the disorder may not make it to adulthood. However, many children with CP end up living long, fulfilling lives. Simply having CP does not prevent a person from developing close friendships, finding romance, or accomplishing great things. People with CP will never have children of their own. New parents of children with CP may feel disheartened by the possibility of never having grandchildren. The truth is that many adults with CP can and do have children of their own. Cerebral palsy does not generally impact a person’s fertility. Additionally, only a minority of CP cases is caused by genetic disorders, and the condition is not usually hereditary — most adults with CP do not have to worry about passing the condition down to their children. Some prospective parents with CP may choose to adopt for medical reasons, while others opt to have biological children. While they may be at greater risk for complications, even women with more severe forms of CP can experience successful pregnancies and give birth to healthy children. Others with the condition may decide maternal surrogacy is right for them. A child with CP will never have a career. While it’s true that people with disabilities face higher rates of unemployment, many children with CP do grow up to have successful careers. People with CP can be found in almost any field. Successful professionals with CP include actors, scientists, authors, and even athletes. Some, such as pediatric neurologist Janice Brunstrom, go on to help improve the lives of future generations of children with CP. Children with Cerebral Palsy can never learn to walk. It’s true that some children with CP will always need to rely on mobility aids, such as wheelchairs or walkers, to get around. However, this is by no means the norm. In fact, over half of people with CP do not require mobility aids at all. While they may walk slowly or with a different gait, children with cerebral palsy may indeed learn to walk independently. Additionally, some people with cerebral palsy aren’t affected by it in their lower limbs and have no trouble walking at all. People with CP will always have limited mobility. Even those who can’t walk aren’t necessarily homebound. Assistive technologies can help wheelchair users stay just as active as independent walkers. For example, modifications to motor vehicles mean that even children who experience paraplegia can learn to drive once they reach their teens. Additionally, more and more communities are investing in accessibility measures, such as curb ramps and wider sidewalks, that ensure people with mobility impairments can freely enjoy the outdoors. Cerebral Palsy is untreatable. For a long time, medical science believed that CP was untreatable. However, this has not been true for decades. Today, children can benefit from a wide variety of cerebral palsy treatments, ranging from physical therapy to medications for co-occurring conditions. Through these therapeutic interventions, parents may see their children’s symptoms improve over time, sometimes significantly. CP is curable. While there are methods of managing CP, there is no current way to cure this condition. However, that doesn’t mean that there will never be a cure for cerebral palsy! The latest research in regenerative medicine and neuroplasticity is quite promising for people living with neurological disorders. Children born with CP today may one day see a true cure for the disorder within their lifetimes. CP is rare. Cerebral Palsy is the number one childhood motor disability and one of the most common causes of chronic disability in children in general. Cerebral palsy affects as many as 1 in 323 children. If you think you’ve never known someone with CP, you may be wrong; remember that mild cases may go unnoticed in adults.\n\nSpecifically, we found parents were more likely to be classified as resolved if their child had a correctable condition such as cleft lip, where surgery could repair the majority of the disfigurement. Parents were more likely to be classified as unresolved if their child had a diagnosis that did not have a medical remedy such as limb deficiencies and cerebral palsy (Barnett et al., 1999). However, child condition made only a tiny contribution to parental adaptation. Several processes that we hypothesize may interfere with parents achieving resolution are listed in Table 3. We believe the unfolding nature of parents' knowledge of their child's prognosis to be one of the biggest challenges to parental adaptation. Specifically, a parent may understand that the child has serious motor impairments and will not walk. However, it may be years before they actually experience the emotions. For example, they may not fully realize their grief until they see their child not walking when his or her peers are, or their child not running and playing tag, when other children are. At each new developmental phase, the parent is likely to experience new emotions related to the child's condition. This developmental unfolding appears to be particularly stressful for parents. They may begin to master their thoughts and feelings, only to have them reawakened over and over. For these reasons, one of the goals of our intervention is to help parents understand the ongoing challenges of raising a child with special needs and to develop the confidence and tools needed to adapt not only in the present, but to anticipate future change and to adapt accordingly. A GROUP INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\nBecause many families report finding it significantly challenging to raise a child with special needs, and because these children are at risk for adjustment problems, we have developed an empirically informed intervention that can improve parent and child well-being. Our group intervention is geared toward parents who have a toddler or a preschooler with special needs. The group was designed for parents of children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and related disorders. It can be adapted to address other conditions. The primary focus is the parent or family psychosocial adaptation to their child rather than working directly with their child per se. Currently, we are offering groups to parents who have known of their child's diagnosis for at least 6 months. We believe that parents should be past the period of initial shock or what Miller (1994) refers to as “surviving” and to have had a chance to learn first hand about their child's condition and some of its implications. Both the literature and parents in our groups suggested that several months are needed to process the medical information on their own or with trusted loved ones, before they are ready to discuss these matters in a group setting with mental health professionals and other parents. We decided not to offer the group to parents of newborns, in part so that they had more time to process the diagnostic information, and because many of the developmental manifestations of their baby's special needs may not be evident until they are older. In contrast, toddlers and preschoolers share a number of developmental issues pertaining to early autonomy and the initial developmental milestones of locomotion and communication (Erickson & Kurz-Riemer, 1999). At the same time, there may be some parents who are more open to change during the initial period of shock and distress. Perhaps the opportunity to engage parents becomes time-limited as some quickly reject their child, placing him or her in the care of a relative or foster parent. An intervention by Pelchat et al. (1999) provided individual counseling by nurses, starting in the hospital and continuing at home soon after the child's birth. Pelchat and colleagues' intervention was based in systems theory. It also had a broad focus that included an effort “To help the parent gain a realistic understanding of the situation and to help them grieve their dream of a perfect child” (p. 468). Those parents who completed the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in their adjustment and social support compared with comparison parents, even when parents were reassessed a year after the intervention. Consequently, identifying when optimally to offer interventions is an open and important question. Our intervention is grounded both in the stress, support, and coping as well as in the grief and adaptation research reviewed in the initial sections of this article.\n\nCerebral palsy in adults can present many unique and unresolved challenges. Medical professionals do not yet have a clear view of how to manage all the issues relevant to an individual with cerebral palsy. Health problems such as arthritis, strained organs, and fatigue can plague patients as they grow older. The disease can affect a person's ability to work or care for him or herself, and aging parents and family members may no longer be available for intensive assistance and care. Ongoing research in the field provides physicians, patients, and their families with hope for new treatments and therapies. A better understanding of the disease will serve to address many of the challenges faced by cerebral palsy in adults. A person diagnosed with cerebral palsy most often experiences an extreme strain on the systems of his or her body. Premature aging is normal and frequently seen in adults with this condition by the time they reach the age of 40. Organs like the heart and lungs may not have developed fully, and have spent decades working in overdrive to respond to the demands of the body. Arthritis is also commonly associated with cerebral palsy in adults, due to years of disproportionate joint compression and a limited range of motion. Cerebral palsy in adults can cause fatigue that interferes with the individual's ability to work or care for him or herself. The complications associated with cerebral palsy and growing older, like premature aging and arthritis, can be draining and difficult to live with. Additionally, the simple act of moving around requires a person living with this disease to exert three to five times the amount of energy as an average person. This extreme strain can limit a person's ability to work in traditional employment. A person affected by cerebral palsy may have had a large support system as a child. Parents are usually available and involved in the upbringing of a child with a developmental or physical illness, and cerebral palsy is no exception. One challenge that occurs with cerebral palsy in adults is the aging of the patient's parents and family. The individual's parents may no longer be living, or could be handling their own medical issues related to aging. Cerebral palsy support groups can be instrumental in assisting an adult living with the disease. Without support, it can be difficult for the person to navigate issues like employment, health care, insurance, and living arrangements. Group homes are an option for people who suffer from severe cerebral palsy, and require daily, hands-on assistance with self-care and feeding.\n\nThe Top Cerebral Palsy Myths\nMany myths about cerebral palsy (CP) persist despite enormous advocacy efforts. These myths also put undue stress on parents and other family members of children with CP. The following list clears up 17 of the most pervasive myths about cerebral palsy:\nCP is a progressive condition. This misconception may come from the confusion of CP with certain neurological disorders, such as Tay–Sachs disease, that are degenerative. Those disorders worsen as the patient gets older. In contrast, cerebral palsy symptoms do not generally increase in severity and instead may actually improve over time. Continued research into surgical options and other therapeutic strategies has made the latter scenario more common in recent years. People with CP can’t live independently. It is true that some people with cerebral palsy need to be cared for their entire lives through family and caregiver support. However, many adults with CP are independent, while others may still require some help. Adults with CP who live independently may make use of the following strategies:\n- Assistive technologies, including mobility aids and transfer equipment. - Modifications to the home and workplace, such as lower countertops for wheelchair users. - Personal care assistance for potentially difficult tasks, such as household chores. Children with Cerebral Palsy can’t communicate. While children with cerebral palsy are more likely to also have language disorders and hearing impairments, many do not. And, those who do have challenges may overcome them through speech therapy and the use of communication devices. Children with CP are intellectually disabled. It is important to remember that, while a neurological disorder, CP is fundamentally a problem with motor function. Still, as many as half of children with CP also have some level of cognitive impairment. This ranges from very mild to severe intellectual disability. Children with CP are also more likely than the general population to have learning disabilities — which are distinct from intellectual disabilities. CP is the same for everyone. CP is actually an umbrella term for a diverse group of neurological disorders that may involve very different symptoms. The four main types of CP are:\n- Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Pyramidal)\n- Athetoid Cerebral Palsy (Extrapyramidal or Dyskinetic)\n- Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n- Mixed Cerebral Palsy\nAnd within each is a wide range of symptoms and severities. For example, one child with spastic CP might have trouble controlling a single arm, while another child with the same condition may have quadriplegia with all four limbs severely affected. Your child’s specific needs and challenges will be unique. Colleges do not accommodate students with Cerebral Palsy. It is increasingly common for young adults with cerebral palsy to pursue a college education. In the US, colleges that receive federal funding — the vast majority of institutions of higher education — are legally required to make accommodations for all disabled students, including those with CP. Even many colleges that don’t receive federal funding often voluntarily offer assistance to students with CP. Accommodations may include following the recommendations outlined in a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), as well as ensuring accessibility to campus facilities. Having CP won’t prevent your child from receiving a quality education. Cerebral Palsy is always caused by medical malpractice. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly following a child’s birth. It could also be due to a condition that results in the brain failing to develop properly. This may be mediated by injury, inflammation, or a lack of oxygen. While it’s true that some cases of CP may be caused by medical malpractice, many are not. Common causes of CP include:\n- Serious maternal infection during pregnancy. - Brain infections after birth, such as meningitis. - Birth complications. - Head trauma. - Congenital disorders, such as heart defects and issues with blood clotting. - Medication errors. - Maternal substance abuse\nFactors that increase the risk for CP include:\n- Premature birth. - Low birth weight. - Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets). - Certain infertility treatments, which increase the chance of having multiple births. - Maternal health conditions, such as seizures and thyroid disorders. Parenting a child with CP is overwhelming.\n\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder that permanently affects movement. Cerebral palsy appears in early childhood or infancy and occurs in about 2.1 of every 1,000 children. While there is no way to fully prevent or cure CP, the condition can be managed in a way that maximizes independence and quality of life for affected individuals. Take the Next Step\nThe key next step for parents is finding the best care for your child. Our multidisciplinary team includes a range of specialists to help with even the most complex mobility challenges. What Is Cerebral Palsy? Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development in the part of the brain that controls muscle movement and coordination. There are three types of cerebral palsy:\n- Spastic cerebral palsy causes muscle stiffness and movement difficulty\n- Athetoid cerebral palsy causes involuntary movements\n- Ataxic cerebral palsy leads to problems with balance and depth perception\nIn Motion: 5K Prep\nMeet up at the front entrance of Dell Children’s Medical Center, from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Ages 5 and up are welcome.

Cerebral Palsy Causes\nMost commonly, cerebral palsy develops in the fetus, but the condition can also develop during infancy or early childhood. The causes of CP are not always identifiable, but many cases can be linked to infection or exposure to radiation during pregnancy, fetal growth restriction or complications during labor. Birth asphyxia, seizures, respiratory problems and low blood sugar during or immediately after birth can also lead to CP. In very young children, cerebral palsy can be caused by lead poisoning, stroke, near drowning, encephalitis, meningitis, shaken baby syndrome or jaundice. Rarely, cases of CP are genetic. Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis\nCerebral palsy is usually initially diagnosed by a physical exam assessing general movements, especially in children 4 months of age or younger. Neuroimaging tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine the cause of CP, but are usually not necessary for a diagnosis. Cerebral Palsy Treatment\nTreatment of cerebral palsy focuses on maximizing independence for each individual with the disorder. Treatment of CP is a lifelong process that can include medication, therapy, surgery or a combination. Therapy can begin as soon as CP is diagnosed and may include physical therapy, speech therapy and therapy for social and emotional development. Medications can help improve muscle stiffness or pain, while braces can assist with walking and other movements. In some cases, orthopedic surgery can repair dislocated hips or abnormal spine curvature such as scoliosis. By focusing on a long-term vision of independence and quality of life from infancy through adulthood, our team of specialists can help infants, children and adolescents with cerebral palsy enjoy activities and hobbies that promote empowerment and enjoyment with as few limitations as possible. - CPATH – Central Texas support group for families & individuals living with cerebral palsy\n- Cerebral Palsy Research Registry\n- American Academy for Cerebral Palsy & Developmental Medicine\n- CP Daily Living\n- United Cerebral Palsy Resource Guide\n- The Cerebral Palsy International Research Foundation (CPIRF)\n- Let’s Cure CP\n\nNo one can relate to what I go through. You need to have a good caregiver since they do not come cheap owing to what it entails to bring her up. You constantly have to plan for the future since there is the overwhelming thought of what would happen should I die tomorrow as my child is totally dependent on me; it’s a very scary feeling. Who has been your biggest support? It’s funny how people get offended when I say I don’t have anybody giving me the type of support I need. Occasionally, friends will support in terms of buying nappies or whatever essentials for her and I’m always grateful for that, but in terms of bearing the load and walking in my shoes, it’s me, God and the caregivers that I employ. I don’t hold grudges because, at the end of the day, she is my daughter to take care of. What advice can you share with new parents of children living with Cerebral Palsy? They should always know that they are their children’s best advocates, listen to their instincts, and research as much as possible about the different treatment options available out there. There are various organisations like Bravehearts Special Needs Association where parents of children living with CP have come together to support each other and raise awareness.\n\nHypotonic Cerebral Palsy\nHypotoniccerebral palsy affects an individual’s muscles by making them overly relaxed. The muscles become so relaxed that it diminishes muscle tone in this condition. In addition, the arms and legs don’t move in tandem with the rest of your body. As a result, individuals with these disorders face problems like difficulty speaking, poor reflexes, and walking abnormalities as they grow up. It is common to have symptoms from all the above types of cerebral palsy. This condition is known as mixed cerebral palsy. Cerebral Palsy: Causes\nCerebral palsy is a result of neurological disorders. It can happen in a mother’s womb or immediately after birth. Hence, several causes can result in cerebral palsy in a child. However, in most cases, the condition is not known. Here are some of the common causes. Fetal Stroke or Hypo-Oxygenemia: Reduced blood or oxygen supply to the brain.Infection caught by the mother: Rubella, chickenpox etc.An injury to the unborn baby’s head in the womb can also lead to cerebral palsy. A severe head injury in the early yearsA strokeBrain not getting enough oxygen (maybe due to nearly choking or drowning)\nCerebral Palsy: Diagnosis\nMost children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed during the first two years. However, if the symptoms are mild, it can be challenging for a doctor to make a reliable diagnosis before 4 or 5. The primary level of diagnosis involves a thorough physical examination of the child. The doctor will assess the child’s development, growth, muscle tone, age-appropriate motor control, hearing and vision, posture, and coordination. That will help them rule out the possibilities of other disorders that could cause similar symptoms. Although symptoms can change over time, cerebral palsy is not progressive. Therefore, if a child continuously loses motor skills, the problem is a condition other than CP. For example, it can be a genetic or muscle disease, metabolism disorder, or tumours in the nervous system. Besides a physical examination, a doctor can recommend some lab tests to diagnose the brain injury that causes the problem. Some of the standard tests are:\nCranial UltrasoundComputed TomographyMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nCerebral Palsy: Treatment\nAlthough there is no permanent cure for cerebral palsy, some treatments and practices can improve a child’s symptoms. As per a study, these practices and treatments include medications, therapies and surgical procedures. The exact choice of these procedures depends upon the specific symptoms that the child undergoes. Like treatments, there is no standard therapy for cerebral palsy. Instead, a healthcare professional will diagnose the child’s impairment to understand the symptoms and affected motor movements. Then, they will work with a child and their parents to develop an appropriate plan to tackle the core disabilities that affect the child’s quality of life. Many children go on to enjoy near-normal adult lives if they successfully manage their disabilities. The earlier treatment begins, the better chance children have of overcoming developmental disabilities or learning new ways to accomplish the tasks that challenge them. Hence, it is essential to rely on therapies under an expert’s guidance to ensure that the child can lead an everyday life with CP disorders. It usually begins in the first few years of life or soon after diagnosis. this is one of the best therapies for children with cerebral palsy. It involves specific exercises like resistive or strength training programs to help the child develop more strength. In addition, it involves activities to help maintain or improve muscle strength, balance, and motor skills and prevent contractures. In addition, healthcare experts also recommend using special braces (called orthotic devices) to improve mobility and stretch spastic muscles. Occupational therapy focuses on optimising upper body function, improving posture, and making the most of a child’s mobility. The therapists help individuals address new ways to perform their everyday activities such as dressing, going to school, and participating in day-to-day activities. Recreation therapy encourages children to participate in art and cultural programs, sports, and other events. It helps them expand physical and cognitive skills and abilities. Children’s parents usually notice an improvement in their condition after participating in recreational therapies. These improvements are primarily in their child’s speech, self-esteem, and emotional well-being.","passages":[{"passage":"I don´t know what its like to have a child with CP, and I don’t know what it feels like when you are told the diagnosis for the first time. However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent. Throughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret. Guilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you. Guilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all. I’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP. I think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day. Just as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret. P.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP. Loss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7ef0cf77-a406-4750-beb2-be4205253fd4>"]},{"passage":"Raising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ebe68948-380b-4167-ba10-e3246f84b471>"]},{"passage":"Every person is different and handles situations differently, but hearing for the first time that your child has cerebral palsy is difficult for any parent. “What does this mean for my child?” and “Now what?” are common questions parents ask after learning of the diagnosis. Learning to navigate the numerous medical and community resources can be challenging. Caring for a child with special needs can also be very emotionally difficult and can create stress upon the family. Every county is different in the services offered to children with special needs. It is important to become educated about what services are offered in your area. There are many social workers at Nationwide Children's Hospital who would be happy to help you access all appropriate services for your child. Ask your physician or the nurse to link you with the clinic social worker and she will be happy to help you with any needs or questions that you might have. You can also call the Clinical Services and Care Coordination Department at (614) 722-6300 and ask to speak to a social worker. Finding other parents who are experiencing similar situations can also be very helpful. It is often helpful to talk to someone who understands what you are going through and has gone through similar difficulties. This is also a good way to get “first hand” information on how the system really works and tips on how to navigate the community agencies. The following is a list of community agencies, websites, and literature that can be helpful to you throughout your journey with your child. - To learn more about CP, visit the CDC website. - Find the contact information for your local Help Me Grow. - Find the contact information for your county DODD. - For the current Summer Camp Directory and Family Resource Directory, contact the State Support Team - Region 11 or call (614) 542-4189. Cerebral Palsy Resources\nChildren with cerebral palsy are at risk for learning difficulties or intellectual disability. There are many children with CP, though, who do not have any learning difficulties. There are many resources to help you and your child in this area. One such program is Help Me Grow\/Early Intervention. This is a program for children birth through 3 years who have been identified as having developmental delays or are at risk for being delayed. This is a program that is operated by every county and the services provided vary from county to county. Help Me Grow can help link your child with therapy either in your home or at a therapy center depending upon the resources in your county. You will also be assigned a Help Me Grow Service Coordinator who can help educate you regarding services in your area and also provide you with information on any child development questions you might have. Once your child turns 3, they no longer qualify for Help Me Grow services. Make sure that your Help Me Grow Service Coordinator transitions you to “The Board of Mental Retardation\/Developmental Disabilities” (MRDD) in your county. Along with a Service Coordinator, MRDD has many programs that can help you and your child. When your child turns 3, the school system becomes responsible for providing your child with the appropriate therapies and education your child requires to participate to their full potential in the educational system. Each school system is mandated by law to provide education to children with special needs when they turn 3. Every school system has a special needs preschool program for those children who qualify. Children can be referred to this program by family or professionals. The child will receive a “Multi-Factor Evaluation” (MFE) to determine eligibility. Once the child is deemed eligible for the program, educational goals need to be established for the child. Your child will remain in the special needs preschool until it is time to transition to Kindergarten. The IEP will help make this transition smooth so that the elementary school is aware of your child’s needs and can provide the appropriate accommodations. The parent(s), along with school personnel, meet together to review the results of the MFE and to then develop an “Individualized Education Plan” (IEP). The IEP lists the educational goals for that child for the school year. The preschool program provides all appropriate therapies within the school setting. The IEP is updated every school year, or more often, if the child’s needs change. - Teaching Motor Skills to Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Parents and Professionals, by Sieglinde Martin, M.S., P.T. - Finding A Way: Living with Cerebral Palsy, by Brenda Bilbrey.

However, CP can vary in severity and therefore require additional care by parents. There is a great deal of support available to families of those with cerebral palsy. These resources range from monetary help to moral support and practical guidance. Simply being able to talk to others who know what you’re going through can help. This means that, while raising a child with CP can be challenging at times, it does not need to be overwhelming. A child with Cerebral Palsy has a limited future. It’s true that people with CP have shorter-than-average life expectancies and that some with more severe forms of the disorder may not make it to adulthood. However, many children with CP end up living long, fulfilling lives. Simply having CP does not prevent a person from developing close friendships, finding romance, or accomplishing great things. People with CP will never have children of their own. New parents of children with CP may feel disheartened by the possibility of never having grandchildren. The truth is that many adults with CP can and do have children of their own. Cerebral palsy does not generally impact a person’s fertility. Additionally, only a minority of CP cases is caused by genetic disorders, and the condition is not usually hereditary — most adults with CP do not have to worry about passing the condition down to their children. Some prospective parents with CP may choose to adopt for medical reasons, while others opt to have biological children. While they may be at greater risk for complications, even women with more severe forms of CP can experience successful pregnancies and give birth to healthy children. Others with the condition may decide maternal surrogacy is right for them. A child with CP will never have a career. While it’s true that people with disabilities face higher rates of unemployment, many children with CP do grow up to have successful careers. People with CP can be found in almost any field. Successful professionals with CP include actors, scientists, authors, and even athletes. Some, such as pediatric neurologist Janice Brunstrom, go on to help improve the lives of future generations of children with CP. Children with Cerebral Palsy can never learn to walk. It’s true that some children with CP will always need to rely on mobility aids, such as wheelchairs or walkers, to get around. However, this is by no means the norm. In fact, over half of people with CP do not require mobility aids at all. While they may walk slowly or with a different gait, children with cerebral palsy may indeed learn to walk independently. Additionally, some people with cerebral palsy aren’t affected by it in their lower limbs and have no trouble walking at all. People with CP will always have limited mobility. Even those who can’t walk aren’t necessarily homebound. Assistive technologies can help wheelchair users stay just as active as independent walkers. For example, modifications to motor vehicles mean that even children who experience paraplegia can learn to drive once they reach their teens. Additionally, more and more communities are investing in accessibility measures, such as curb ramps and wider sidewalks, that ensure people with mobility impairments can freely enjoy the outdoors. Cerebral Palsy is untreatable. For a long time, medical science believed that CP was untreatable. However, this has not been true for decades. Today, children can benefit from a wide variety of cerebral palsy treatments, ranging from physical therapy to medications for co-occurring conditions. Through these therapeutic interventions, parents may see their children’s symptoms improve over time, sometimes significantly. CP is curable. While there are methods of managing CP, there is no current way to cure this condition. However, that doesn’t mean that there will never be a cure for cerebral palsy! The latest research in regenerative medicine and neuroplasticity is quite promising for people living with neurological disorders. Children born with CP today may one day see a true cure for the disorder within their lifetimes. CP is rare. Cerebral Palsy is the number one childhood motor disability and one of the most common causes of chronic disability in children in general. Cerebral palsy affects as many as 1 in 323 children. If you think you’ve never known someone with CP, you may be wrong; remember that mild cases may go unnoticed in adults.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9a5a699c-e09e-44c9-a141-f0a39b271c98>"]},{"passage":"Specifically, we found parents were more likely to be classified as resolved if their child had a correctable condition such as cleft lip, where surgery could repair the majority of the disfigurement. Parents were more likely to be classified as unresolved if their child had a diagnosis that did not have a medical remedy such as limb deficiencies and cerebral palsy (Barnett et al., 1999). However, child condition made only a tiny contribution to parental adaptation. Several processes that we hypothesize may interfere with parents achieving resolution are listed in Table 3. We believe the unfolding nature of parents' knowledge of their child's prognosis to be one of the biggest challenges to parental adaptation. Specifically, a parent may understand that the child has serious motor impairments and will not walk. However, it may be years before they actually experience the emotions. For example, they may not fully realize their grief until they see their child not walking when his or her peers are, or their child not running and playing tag, when other children are. At each new developmental phase, the parent is likely to experience new emotions related to the child's condition. This developmental unfolding appears to be particularly stressful for parents. They may begin to master their thoughts and feelings, only to have them reawakened over and over. For these reasons, one of the goals of our intervention is to help parents understand the ongoing challenges of raising a child with special needs and to develop the confidence and tools needed to adapt not only in the present, but to anticipate future change and to adapt accordingly. A GROUP INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\nBecause many families report finding it significantly challenging to raise a child with special needs, and because these children are at risk for adjustment problems, we have developed an empirically informed intervention that can improve parent and child well-being. Our group intervention is geared toward parents who have a toddler or a preschooler with special needs. The group was designed for parents of children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and related disorders. It can be adapted to address other conditions. The primary focus is the parent or family psychosocial adaptation to their child rather than working directly with their child per se. Currently, we are offering groups to parents who have known of their child's diagnosis for at least 6 months. We believe that parents should be past the period of initial shock or what Miller (1994) refers to as “surviving” and to have had a chance to learn first hand about their child's condition and some of its implications. Both the literature and parents in our groups suggested that several months are needed to process the medical information on their own or with trusted loved ones, before they are ready to discuss these matters in a group setting with mental health professionals and other parents. We decided not to offer the group to parents of newborns, in part so that they had more time to process the diagnostic information, and because many of the developmental manifestations of their baby's special needs may not be evident until they are older. In contrast, toddlers and preschoolers share a number of developmental issues pertaining to early autonomy and the initial developmental milestones of locomotion and communication (Erickson & Kurz-Riemer, 1999). At the same time, there may be some parents who are more open to change during the initial period of shock and distress. Perhaps the opportunity to engage parents becomes time-limited as some quickly reject their child, placing him or her in the care of a relative or foster parent. An intervention by Pelchat et al. (1999) provided individual counseling by nurses, starting in the hospital and continuing at home soon after the child's birth. Pelchat and colleagues' intervention was based in systems theory. It also had a broad focus that included an effort “To help the parent gain a realistic understanding of the situation and to help them grieve their dream of a perfect child” (p. 468). Those parents who completed the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in their adjustment and social support compared with comparison parents, even when parents were reassessed a year after the intervention. Consequently, identifying when optimally to offer interventions is an open and important question. Our intervention is grounded both in the stress, support, and coping as well as in the grief and adaptation research reviewed in the initial sections of this article.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b9b0feec-c823-4aeb-8b62-892bbab6fd78>"]},{"passage":"Cerebral palsy in adults can present many unique and unresolved challenges. Medical professionals do not yet have a clear view of how to manage all the issues relevant to an individual with cerebral palsy. Health problems such as arthritis, strained organs, and fatigue can plague patients as they grow older. The disease can affect a person's ability to work or care for him or herself, and aging parents and family members may no longer be available for intensive assistance and care. Ongoing research in the field provides physicians, patients, and their families with hope for new treatments and therapies. A better understanding of the disease will serve to address many of the challenges faced by cerebral palsy in adults. A person diagnosed with cerebral palsy most often experiences an extreme strain on the systems of his or her body. Premature aging is normal and frequently seen in adults with this condition by the time they reach the age of 40. Organs like the heart and lungs may not have developed fully, and have spent decades working in overdrive to respond to the demands of the body. Arthritis is also commonly associated with cerebral palsy in adults, due to years of disproportionate joint compression and a limited range of motion. Cerebral palsy in adults can cause fatigue that interferes with the individual's ability to work or care for him or herself. The complications associated with cerebral palsy and growing older, like premature aging and arthritis, can be draining and difficult to live with. Additionally, the simple act of moving around requires a person living with this disease to exert three to five times the amount of energy as an average person. This extreme strain can limit a person's ability to work in traditional employment. A person affected by cerebral palsy may have had a large support system as a child. Parents are usually available and involved in the upbringing of a child with a developmental or physical illness, and cerebral palsy is no exception. One challenge that occurs with cerebral palsy in adults is the aging of the patient's parents and family. The individual's parents may no longer be living, or could be handling their own medical issues related to aging. Cerebral palsy support groups can be instrumental in assisting an adult living with the disease. Without support, it can be difficult for the person to navigate issues like employment, health care, insurance, and living arrangements. Group homes are an option for people who suffer from severe cerebral palsy, and require daily, hands-on assistance with self-care and feeding.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f6923bb2-67b1-46fb-b7cc-826f5b10526b>"]},{"passage":"The Top Cerebral Palsy Myths\nMany myths about cerebral palsy (CP) persist despite enormous advocacy efforts. These myths also put undue stress on parents and other family members of children with CP. The following list clears up 17 of the most pervasive myths about cerebral palsy:\nCP is a progressive condition. This misconception may come from the confusion of CP with certain neurological disorders, such as Tay–Sachs disease, that are degenerative. Those disorders worsen as the patient gets older. In contrast, cerebral palsy symptoms do not generally increase in severity and instead may actually improve over time. Continued research into surgical options and other therapeutic strategies has made the latter scenario more common in recent years. People with CP can’t live independently. It is true that some people with cerebral palsy need to be cared for their entire lives through family and caregiver support. However, many adults with CP are independent, while others may still require some help. Adults with CP who live independently may make use of the following strategies:\n- Assistive technologies, including mobility aids and transfer equipment. - Modifications to the home and workplace, such as lower countertops for wheelchair users. - Personal care assistance for potentially difficult tasks, such as household chores. Children with Cerebral Palsy can’t communicate. While children with cerebral palsy are more likely to also have language disorders and hearing impairments, many do not. And, those who do have challenges may overcome them through speech therapy and the use of communication devices. Children with CP are intellectually disabled. It is important to remember that, while a neurological disorder, CP is fundamentally a problem with motor function. Still, as many as half of children with CP also have some level of cognitive impairment. This ranges from very mild to severe intellectual disability. Children with CP are also more likely than the general population to have learning disabilities — which are distinct from intellectual disabilities. CP is the same for everyone. CP is actually an umbrella term for a diverse group of neurological disorders that may involve very different symptoms. The four main types of CP are:\n- Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Pyramidal)\n- Athetoid Cerebral Palsy (Extrapyramidal or Dyskinetic)\n- Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n- Mixed Cerebral Palsy\nAnd within each is a wide range of symptoms and severities. For example, one child with spastic CP might have trouble controlling a single arm, while another child with the same condition may have quadriplegia with all four limbs severely affected. Your child’s specific needs and challenges will be unique. Colleges do not accommodate students with Cerebral Palsy. It is increasingly common for young adults with cerebral palsy to pursue a college education. In the US, colleges that receive federal funding — the vast majority of institutions of higher education — are legally required to make accommodations for all disabled students, including those with CP. Even many colleges that don’t receive federal funding often voluntarily offer assistance to students with CP. Accommodations may include following the recommendations outlined in a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), as well as ensuring accessibility to campus facilities. Having CP won’t prevent your child from receiving a quality education. Cerebral Palsy is always caused by medical malpractice. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly following a child’s birth. It could also be due to a condition that results in the brain failing to develop properly. This may be mediated by injury, inflammation, or a lack of oxygen. While it’s true that some cases of CP may be caused by medical malpractice, many are not. Common causes of CP include:\n- Serious maternal infection during pregnancy. - Brain infections after birth, such as meningitis. - Birth complications. - Head trauma. - Congenital disorders, such as heart defects and issues with blood clotting. - Medication errors. - Maternal substance abuse\nFactors that increase the risk for CP include:\n- Premature birth. - Low birth weight. - Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets). - Certain infertility treatments, which increase the chance of having multiple births. - Maternal health conditions, such as seizures and thyroid disorders.

Cerebral Palsy Causes\nMost commonly, cerebral palsy develops in the fetus, but the condition can also develop during infancy or early childhood. The causes of CP are not always identifiable, but many cases can be linked to infection or exposure to radiation during pregnancy, fetal growth restriction or complications during labor. Birth asphyxia, seizures, respiratory problems and low blood sugar during or immediately after birth can also lead to CP. In very young children, cerebral palsy can be caused by lead poisoning, stroke, near drowning, encephalitis, meningitis, shaken baby syndrome or jaundice. Rarely, cases of CP are genetic. Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis\nCerebral palsy is usually initially diagnosed by a physical exam assessing general movements, especially in children 4 months of age or younger. Neuroimaging tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine the cause of CP, but are usually not necessary for a diagnosis. Cerebral Palsy Treatment\nTreatment of cerebral palsy focuses on maximizing independence for each individual with the disorder. Treatment of CP is a lifelong process that can include medication, therapy, surgery or a combination. Therapy can begin as soon as CP is diagnosed and may include physical therapy, speech therapy and therapy for social and emotional development. Medications can help improve muscle stiffness or pain, while braces can assist with walking and other movements. In some cases, orthopedic surgery can repair dislocated hips or abnormal spine curvature such as scoliosis. By focusing on a long-term vision of independence and quality of life from infancy through adulthood, our team of specialists can help infants, children and adolescents with cerebral palsy enjoy activities and hobbies that promote empowerment and enjoyment with as few limitations as possible. - CPATH – Central Texas support group for families & individuals living with cerebral palsy\n- Cerebral Palsy Research Registry\n- American Academy for Cerebral Palsy & Developmental Medicine\n- CP Daily Living\n- United Cerebral Palsy Resource Guide\n- The Cerebral Palsy International Research Foundation (CPIRF)\n- Let’s Cure CP","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3412a23f-09ec-4a74-9b13-95114ec13975>"]},{"passage":"No one can relate to what I go through.

The muscles become so relaxed that it diminishes muscle tone in this condition. In addition, the arms and legs don’t move in tandem with the rest of your body. As a result, individuals with these disorders face problems like difficulty speaking, poor reflexes, and walking abnormalities as they grow up. It is common to have symptoms from all the above types of cerebral palsy. This condition is known as mixed cerebral palsy. Cerebral Palsy: Causes\nCerebral palsy is a result of neurological disorders. It can happen in a mother’s womb or immediately after birth. Hence, several causes can result in cerebral palsy in a child. However, in most cases, the condition is not known. Here are some of the common causes. Fetal Stroke or Hypo-Oxygenemia: Reduced blood or oxygen supply to the brain.Infection caught by the mother: Rubella, chickenpox etc.An injury to the unborn baby’s head in the womb can also lead to cerebral palsy. A severe head injury in the early yearsA strokeBrain not getting enough oxygen (maybe due to nearly choking or drowning)\nCerebral Palsy: Diagnosis\nMost children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed during the first two years. However, if the symptoms are mild, it can be challenging for a doctor to make a reliable diagnosis before 4 or 5. The primary level of diagnosis involves a thorough physical examination of the child. The doctor will assess the child’s development, growth, muscle tone, age-appropriate motor control, hearing and vision, posture, and coordination. That will help them rule out the possibilities of other disorders that could cause similar symptoms. Although symptoms can change over time, cerebral palsy is not progressive. Therefore, if a child continuously loses motor skills, the problem is a condition other than CP. For example, it can be a genetic or muscle disease, metabolism disorder, or tumours in the nervous system. Besides a physical examination, a doctor can recommend some lab tests to diagnose the brain injury that causes the problem. Some of the standard tests are:\nCranial UltrasoundComputed TomographyMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nCerebral Palsy: Treatment\nAlthough there is no permanent cure for cerebral palsy, some treatments and practices can improve a child’s symptoms. As per a study, these practices and treatments include medications, therapies and surgical procedures. The exact choice of these procedures depends upon the specific symptoms that the child undergoes. Like treatments, there is no standard therapy for cerebral palsy. Instead, a healthcare professional will diagnose the child’s impairment to understand the symptoms and affected motor movements. Then, they will work with a child and their parents to develop an appropriate plan to tackle the core disabilities that affect the child’s quality of life. Many children go on to enjoy near-normal adult lives if they successfully manage their disabilities. The earlier treatment begins, the better chance children have of overcoming developmental disabilities or learning new ways to accomplish the tasks that challenge them. Hence, it is essential to rely on therapies under an expert’s guidance to ensure that the child can lead an everyday life with CP disorders. It usually begins in the first few years of life or soon after diagnosis. this is one of the best therapies for children with cerebral palsy. It involves specific exercises like resistive or strength training programs to help the child develop more strength. In addition, it involves activities to help maintain or improve muscle strength, balance, and motor skills and prevent contractures. In addition, healthcare experts also recommend using special braces (called orthotic devices) to improve mobility and stretch spastic muscles. Occupational therapy focuses on optimising upper body function, improving posture, and making the most of a child’s mobility. The therapists help individuals address new ways to perform their everyday activities such as dressing, going to school, and participating in day-to-day activities. Recreation therapy encourages children to participate in art and cultural programs, sports, and other events. It helps them expand physical and cognitive skills and abilities. Children’s parents usually notice an improvement in their condition after participating in recreational therapies. These improvements are primarily in their child’s speech, self-esteem, and emotional well-being.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:241c8977-f164-4413-9c52-d8a7926ebcc4>"]}]}

Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many.\nA new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain.\nThe cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop.\n\"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\nIntervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster.\nAlthough past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine.\nThis study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans.\nEach disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated.

Nicotine-induced damage to the blood vessels can impair this process, leading to a lack of essential nutrients and oxygen for the discs. This can contribute to the degeneration of the discs, making them more susceptible to injury and less able to absorb shock.\n\nAdditionally, nicotine has been shown to stimulate the production of certain proteins called metalloproteinases, which can break down the extracellular matrix (the structural framework) of the discs. This further contributes to disc degeneration and may increase the risk of disc herniation.\n\nIn summary, nicotine consumption can negatively impact the health of intervertebral discs by damaging the blood vessels that supply them with nutrients and oxygen, as well as promoting the breakdown of the discs' structural framework.

Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Intervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. On average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not. \"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\" The study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA.

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption. Smoking cessation is highly advisable with positive effects on the bone metabolism on the long term. More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.\n\nFacts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.\n\nThe Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.\n\nWhen you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)\n\nNicotine is usually associated with tobacco cigarettes and it is probably why it enjoys such a negative reputation. Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.\n\nIndividuals exposed to carcinogens, such as asbestos and radon, are likely to suffer from: Lung cancer, Oral and nasal cavity cancer, pharynx and larynx cancers, and esophagus cancer, pancreatic cancer, urinary bladder cancer, stomach, liver and kidney cancers. They may also suffer from leukemia and uterine cervix cancer. Miscellaneous Health Effects\nSmoking may cause complications to the eyes, such as cataract, macular degeneration, which results in loss of sharp vision. Smoking has a major influence on oral hygiene, such as bad breath increasing the risk of tooth loss. It also contributes to bone loss, poor healing of muscle and skeletal injuries. Smoking results Compromised reproductive health in the male body by reducing the male sperm level, increases the number of deformed sperms, results in genetic damage to the sperm and impotence due to the effects of smoking on blood flow and damage to the blood vessels of the penis. In the female body, smoking results in reduced fertility, menstrual cycle irregularities or absence of menstruation cycle and attainment of menopause prior to an individuals original time that is one or two years earlier. The effects of tobacco smoke are not limited to smokers alone. Maternal smoking effects can be realized on the unborn baby leading to an increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. It brings about low birth weight, which may have a lasting effect on the growth and development of a child. Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, being overweight and diabetes in adulthood Maternal smoking increases the risk of cleft palate (palatoschisis) and cleft lip (cheiloschisis) a congenital deformity caused by abnormal facial development during gestation resulting in a gap on the upper lip of a child. Second-hand smoke may harm a fetus if the mother is exposed to paternal smoking. Some of the negative social consequences of smoking are based on what smoking does to a person's body. Cigarette smoking causes the following symptoms:\nIt stains the teeth yellow and causes bad breath. Yellow teeth make a person look older while bad breath is unattractive and a social ill. Smoking causes tooth decay making smokers prone to losing teeth. Smoking also stains fingernails and skin. People can develop yellow fingernails and skin from smoking, which makes them look unhealthy and unattractive. It causes chronic coughs, which may make other people avoid the smoker. It causes wrinkled skin making the smokers look older than they are. Some of smoking paradoxes have been uncovered by researchers that nicotine in tobacco smoke contains anti-inflammatory agents and deters disease forming process. Nicotine has the following effects:\nRisk of ulcerative colitis, a disease of the colon that is characterized by ulcers or open sores has been shown to be reduced by smokers on a dose-dependent basis. According to studies, smokers are less likely to be affected by aphthous ulcer, a type of mouth ulcer that presents as a painful open sore inside the mouthor upper throat characterized by a tear in the mucus linings. Smoking can also reduce rates of uterine fibroids, a benign tumor in the muscles of the uterus. Nicotine is also an effective antipsychotic. Studies have shown that nicotine from smoke reduces schizophrenia Nicotine reduces the risk of Pre-eclampsia a medical condition in which hypertension arises during pregnancy as a result of increased levels of protein in the urine. Apart from health advantages of smoking as stated above, smoking aids in social group acceptance. It is also an effective weight loss aid through a variety of mechanisms including increased metabolic demand and appetite suppression. It also aids in performance enhancement in tasks requiring concentration. This is especially so for smokers who have used tobacco for a long time. Cigarette smoking has been shown to increase serum hemoglobin and total lung capacity, factors that all contribute to enhanced performance in endurance sports. Nicotine in tobacco smoke is also responsible for Stress relief and anxiety loss as a result of relaxation of the muscles.\n\nShort term effects of tobacco\nWhen a person smokes a cigarette, the body responds immediately to the chemical nicotine in the smoke. Nicotine causes a short-term increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and the flow of blood from the heart. It also causes the arteries to narrow. Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen the blood can carry. This, combined with the effects produced by nicotine, creates an imbalance in the demand for oxygen by the cells and the amount of oxygen the blood is able to supply. Long term effetcs of tobacco\nMost people think of cancer when they think of tobacco use. Tobacco does cause a wide variety of devastating cancers. However, tobacco kills even more people through heart disease and stroke than it does through cancer! About 181,000 people die each year in the United States from smoking-related heart disease and stroke, and about 158,000 die from smoking-related cancer. The remainder of the smoking-related deaths, 123,000, are from lung diseases other than cancer. - Hypertension (high blood pressure.) - Congestive heart failure — Ineffective pumping of the heart leads to an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. - Coronary heart disease – Narrowed arteries lead to heart attack and death. - Heart attacks and congestive heart failure. - Blocked blood vessels. - Strokes – Blocked bloodflow to the brain or bleeding in the brain. Stroke is a major killer. - Smoking causes cancer of the lung, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, bladder and cervix. Recent evidence links smoking with cancer of large intestine and some forms of leukemia. - Most deaths from lung cancer are caused by smoking\n- Although other factors can cause lung cancer, smoking is responsible for 85% of all new cases of lung cancer in Canada. - Lung cancer is a highly lethal disease; only a small minority of patients are alive five years after diagnosis. - The causal relationship between smoking and cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus has been established for many years. Smokeless tobacco also causes cancer of the mouth. - Like all tobacco-caused diseases, the risk increases with amount and duration of smoking. Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for these cancers, and the combination of alcohol consumption and smoking results in a greatly increased risk. - Recent studies confirm earlier findings of a strong link between smoking and cancer of the pancreas and with cancer of the kidney and bladder. - Recent findings also suggest that smoking may be a previously unrecognized cause of cancer of the large intestine (colorectal cancer) in both men and women. Evidence is also growing concerning a link between smoking and some forms of leukemia. - Emphysema — The very small airways (bronchioles) that join the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs lose elasticity. Patient loses ability to exhale fully, and chemical balance in the blood is disturbed. There is no cure for emphysema. - Chronic Bronchitis — The airways of the lungs change shape and size and the mucous glands are enlarged, causing coughing and production of sputum. - Abnormal sperm cells. - Difficulty maintaining pregnancy. - Menstrual disorders and early menopause\n- Smoking during pregnancy can lead to:\n- Miscarriage or stillbirth. - Low birth weight –\n- Babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy weigh on the average between 200 to 300 grams less than other babies. - Premature birth –\n- Both low birth weight and premature birth can lead to breathing and other health problems. - Learning and behavior problems later in childhood. - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or “crib death” — Seemingly healthy babies die without warning. - More upper respiratory problems, ear complications, or asthma when exposed to tobacco prior to birth. - Prematurely wrinkled skin. - Permanent gum and tooth loss. - Lost or weakened sense of taste. - Weakened immune system. - Stomach ulcers. - Unwanted weight loss.

By giving a cushioning effect, the intervertebral discs allow us to achieve a certain degree of body flexion. As modern people often bow their heads to look down on their mobile phones and bend their spines incorrectly, the intervertebral discs in the neck and waist are often stressed, which make disc herniation an even more common problem nowadays. Intervertebral discs are in fact surrounded by fibrous tissues. In the centre of the discs is a jelly-like substance called nucleus pulposus, which is tightly wrapped and protected by the annulus. When the tissues have been stressed for a prolonged period, aged or strained, the annulus may tear. Then when the gel is squeezed out, the problem of disc herniation will result. The protruding discs may be pressed to the surrounding nerves, causing sciatica, which often comes with pain, tingling sensation, numbness or weakness.","passages":[{"passage":"(RxWiki News) It’s a well-known fact — cigarettes are bad for your health. Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Intervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. On average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not. \"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\" The study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA.

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption.

More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bafe38fc-6bf3-468e-94be-7ebd726b62ad>"]},{"passage":"Facts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d90f364-0e12-4570-af17-d6e8974bc88f>"]},{"passage":"The Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:98323d54-2e04-4c69-b3f0-aed4fe55fc3e>"]},{"passage":"When you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3333a0ac-7f61-4293-b595-b8ad37fe5a5d>"]},{"passage":"In the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691.

Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d346b643-d24f-4d27-b93d-2ce56fa23091>"]},{"passage":"Individuals exposed to carcinogens, such as asbestos and radon, are likely to suffer from: Lung cancer, Oral and nasal cavity cancer, pharynx and larynx cancers, and esophagus cancer, pancreatic cancer, urinary bladder cancer, stomach, liver and kidney cancers. They may also suffer from leukemia and uterine cervix cancer. Miscellaneous Health Effects\nSmoking may cause complications to the eyes, such as cataract, macular degeneration, which results in loss of sharp vision. Smoking has a major influence on oral hygiene, such as bad breath increasing the risk of tooth loss. It also contributes to bone loss, poor healing of muscle and skeletal injuries. Smoking results Compromised reproductive health in the male body by reducing the male sperm level, increases the number of deformed sperms, results in genetic damage to the sperm and impotence due to the effects of smoking on blood flow and damage to the blood vessels of the penis. In the female body, smoking results in reduced fertility, menstrual cycle irregularities or absence of menstruation cycle and attainment of menopause prior to an individuals original time that is one or two years earlier. The effects of tobacco smoke are not limited to smokers alone. Maternal smoking effects can be realized on the unborn baby leading to an increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature birth. It brings about low birth weight, which may have a lasting effect on the growth and development of a child. Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, being overweight and diabetes in adulthood Maternal smoking increases the risk of cleft palate (palatoschisis) and cleft lip (cheiloschisis) a congenital deformity caused by abnormal facial development during gestation resulting in a gap on the upper lip of a child. Second-hand smoke may harm a fetus if the mother is exposed to paternal smoking. Some of the negative social consequences of smoking are based on what smoking does to a person's body. Cigarette smoking causes the following symptoms:\nIt stains the teeth yellow and causes bad breath. Yellow teeth make a person look older while bad breath is unattractive and a social ill. Smoking causes tooth decay making smokers prone to losing teeth. Smoking also stains fingernails and skin. People can develop yellow fingernails and skin from smoking, which makes them look unhealthy and unattractive. It causes chronic coughs, which may make other people avoid the smoker. It causes wrinkled skin making the smokers look older than they are. Some of smoking paradoxes have been uncovered by researchers that nicotine in tobacco smoke contains anti-inflammatory agents and deters disease forming process. Nicotine has the following effects:\nRisk of ulcerative colitis, a disease of the colon that is characterized by ulcers or open sores has been shown to be reduced by smokers on a dose-dependent basis. According to studies, smokers are less likely to be affected by aphthous ulcer, a type of mouth ulcer that presents as a painful open sore inside the mouthor upper throat characterized by a tear in the mucus linings. Smoking can also reduce rates of uterine fibroids, a benign tumor in the muscles of the uterus. Nicotine is also an effective antipsychotic. Studies have shown that nicotine from smoke reduces schizophrenia Nicotine reduces the risk of Pre-eclampsia a medical condition in which hypertension arises during pregnancy as a result of increased levels of protein in the urine. Apart from health advantages of smoking as stated above, smoking aids in social group acceptance. It is also an effective weight loss aid through a variety of mechanisms including increased metabolic demand and appetite suppression. It also aids in performance enhancement in tasks requiring concentration. This is especially so for smokers who have used tobacco for a long time.

Nicotine causes a short-term increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and the flow of blood from the heart. It also causes the arteries to narrow. Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen the blood can carry. This, combined with the effects produced by nicotine, creates an imbalance in the demand for oxygen by the cells and the amount of oxygen the blood is able to supply. Long term effetcs of tobacco\nMost people think of cancer when they think of tobacco use. Tobacco does cause a wide variety of devastating cancers. However, tobacco kills even more people through heart disease and stroke than it does through cancer! About 181,000 people die each year in the United States from smoking-related heart disease and stroke, and about 158,000 die from smoking-related cancer. The remainder of the smoking-related deaths, 123,000, are from lung diseases other than cancer. - Hypertension (high blood pressure.) - Congestive heart failure — Ineffective pumping of the heart leads to an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. - Coronary heart disease – Narrowed arteries lead to heart attack and death. - Heart attacks and congestive heart failure. - Blocked blood vessels. - Strokes – Blocked bloodflow to the brain or bleeding in the brain. Stroke is a major killer. - Smoking causes cancer of the lung, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, bladder and cervix. Recent evidence links smoking with cancer of large intestine and some forms of leukemia. - Most deaths from lung cancer are caused by smoking\n- Although other factors can cause lung cancer, smoking is responsible for 85% of all new cases of lung cancer in Canada. - Lung cancer is a highly lethal disease; only a small minority of patients are alive five years after diagnosis. - The causal relationship between smoking and cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus has been established for many years. Smokeless tobacco also causes cancer of the mouth. - Like all tobacco-caused diseases, the risk increases with amount and duration of smoking. Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for these cancers, and the combination of alcohol consumption and smoking results in a greatly increased risk. - Recent studies confirm earlier findings of a strong link between smoking and cancer of the pancreas and with cancer of the kidney and bladder. - Recent findings also suggest that smoking may be a previously unrecognized cause of cancer of the large intestine (colorectal cancer) in both men and women. Evidence is also growing concerning a link between smoking and some forms of leukemia. - Emphysema — The very small airways (bronchioles) that join the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs lose elasticity. Patient loses ability to exhale fully, and chemical balance in the blood is disturbed. There is no cure for emphysema. - Chronic Bronchitis — The airways of the lungs change shape and size and the mucous glands are enlarged, causing coughing and production of sputum. - Abnormal sperm cells. - Difficulty maintaining pregnancy. - Menstrual disorders and early menopause\n- Smoking during pregnancy can lead to:\n- Miscarriage or stillbirth. - Low birth weight –\n- Babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy weigh on the average between 200 to 300 grams less than other babies. - Premature birth –\n- Both low birth weight and premature birth can lead to breathing and other health problems. - Learning and behavior problems later in childhood. - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or “crib death” — Seemingly healthy babies die without warning. - More upper respiratory problems, ear complications, or asthma when exposed to tobacco prior to birth. - Prematurely wrinkled skin. - Permanent gum and tooth loss. - Lost or weakened sense of taste. - Weakened immune system. - Stomach ulcers. - Unwanted weight loss.

Composed of bone and intervertebral discs, the spine plays a major role in supporting and bearing the weight of the body. By giving a cushioning effect, the intervertebral discs allow us to achieve a certain degree of body flexion. As modern people often bow their heads to look down on their mobile phones and bend their spines incorrectly, the intervertebral discs in the neck and waist are often stressed, which make disc herniation an even more common problem nowadays. Intervertebral discs are in fact surrounded by fibrous tissues. In the centre of the discs is a jelly-like substance called nucleus pulposus, which is tightly wrapped and protected by the annulus. When the tissues have been stressed for a prolonged period, aged or strained, the annulus may tear. Then when the gel is squeezed out, the problem of disc herniation will result. The protruding discs may be pressed to the surrounding nerves, causing sciatica, which often comes with pain, tingling sensation, numbness or weakness.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ddb1ede2-77b4-46a4-a6a6-e834eff76d65>"]}]}

For chest, waist, or hips measurements, the tape should be parallel to the ground.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Chest\/Bust**: Place the measuring tape under the arms and wrap it around the fullest part of the bust, keeping the tape parallel to the floor.\n\n2. **Waist**: Find your natural waist, which is usually the narrowest part of your torso above the belly button.

Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding.

The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket.

To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below:\nHere are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones:\nSleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement\nThis is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight\nIt’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad\nYou want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad\nYes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up\nHold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so:\nPretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes\nLet’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly.

You can find out your waist measurement easily, in the comfort of your home. Strip down to your underwear before starting the waist-measuring process. Stand up straight and relax your abdominal muscles. Find your natural waist. An easy way to do this is to stand in front of the mirror and bend at your side. The crease that forms indicates your natural waistline, directly above the belly button and below the ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape completely around your waist starting at the belly button. Begin at the spot on the tape where the measure reads \"0.\" Make sure the tape is level around your waistline--not too loose, not too tight. Do not place the measuring tape over clothes. You'll get the most accurate results on bare skin. However, make sure the tape is not squeezing into your skin. The number that meets the \"0\" after you have circled your entire waist is your waist measurement. Remove the tape and jot down your measurement for future reference. You may want to take your measurements in front of a full-length mirror to ensure you are measuring the right area and that the measuring tape isn't crooked. A healthy waistline for a woman is between 32 and 23 inches. For a man, it's between 45 and 32 inches. Make sure you use body measuring tape, which is made of fabric or bendable plastic.

By Samantha Eckert\nIf you do decide to shop, make it easier on yourself by knowing your measurements before you try on or order show clothes. With show clothing, it is important that everything fits correctly. If something is too tight or loose, it can compromise your overall appearance in the show pen. Buy a flexible measuring tape from your local craft or fabric store for the most accurate numbers. When measuring yourself, wear the same undergarments that you show in. Enlist the help of a friend to take the most accurate measurements. Be sure to write them all down and keep them with you while you are shopping. Learn Nicole Barnes’ secrets to perfect showmanship patterns in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report! Where to Measure\nThe basic measurements women will need to find a well-fitted jacket are: waist, bust, neck, hips, front width and back waist. It is important when measuring to not pull to tightly on the measuring tape. This is called a skin measurement. Stand relaxed, but with good posture. Start with your waist. Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding. Your front width is from the crease where the arm meets the body to the crease on the other side, above the breasts and not across the fullest part. The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket. To measure your back waist, put the measuring tape at the nape of your neck. Then, measure the distance to where you would like your jacket to end. Showmanship jackets should end at the fullest part of your hips, anything longer will make your legs look short. Your hips are measured around the fullest part of your bottom with the tape parallel to the floor. For riding jackets you need to know where your chaps fit while you are mounted and riding. It is popular to have jackets that can be worn in multiple classes. If you are looking for a versatile jacket, be sure to know whether you want to wear it tucked in or left out while showing in riding classes. If you plan on wearing the jacket tucked in, be sure it is long enough that it will not un-tuck while riding and moving. If you plan on wearing the jacket un-tucked, it needs to fit over your chaps or hit just above them to show your belt buckle. Here are the top 24 photos we’ve picked for the AQHA calendar contest.

How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS. Our technicians are standing by to answer your questions, so you can see if you’re a candidate for TMS treatment.\n\n- Follow the schedule through until the very end. - Stay in touch with your doctor and report any side effects. - Talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you cope with any side effects or returning symptoms of depression or anxiety while you are tapering the medication. TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants? If you would like to stop or reduce the dosage of antidepressants you are taking, consult with your doctor.

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes in the brain that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, among others that are commonly found with antidepressant drugs. The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required. Sarkis Family Psychiatry typically delivers NeuroStar TMS Therapy 5 times per week for 50 minute sessions over 5-6 weeks, but it varies. Your treatment may be shorter or longer.\n\nMagnetic energy similar to what is used in an (MRI) is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that are sluggish and causing depressed mood. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of NeuroStar® TMS Therapy in treating patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant medication. NeuroStar TMS Therapy was studied in adult patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, all of whom had not received satisfactory improvement with previous treatments. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of the brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 19-37 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. It usually takes time for healthcare insurers to establish coverage policies for newly approved treatments such as NeuroStar TMS. However, many commercial and Medicare plans have recognized the effectiveness of treating depression with TMS Therapy and now cover TMS as part of their plans. See here for a full list of insurance plans that cover TMS. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were headache and scalp discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment.

These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells.\n\nTMS can improve depression symptoms in clients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to other depression treatments like antidepressant medications or talk therapy. It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.\n\nWhile TMS Therapy has shown to be effective, not all patients will benefit from it. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, signs or symptoms of suicidal behavior, and\/or unusual behavior. Families and caregivers should also be aware of the need to observe patients and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen. Typically, the average course of TMS Therapy happens five times per week for exactly 37 minutes sessions over a 4-6 week timeframe. Any additional treatments are based on clinical judgment. No. While both show effective results for treating depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During a TMS treatment session, patients are sitting, awake and alert throughout the entire 37-minute procedure. This means that no sedation is required for TMS Therapy. Patients are able to transport themselves to and from their treatment. In contrast, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), commonly referred to as “shock therapy,” is meant to intentionally causes a seizure. Patients who receive ECT are sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. After the treatment, recovery occurs slowly, and patients are typically monitored under close supervision for minutes or a even few hours after a treatment. Patients often experience short-term confusion and memory loss after a ECT session. Even long-term memory disruptions have been reported and may persist indefinitely in some people. Significant caregiver supervision is often required after treatment, due to the side effects commonly associated with ECT. TMS is non-systemic, which means that it does not circulate in the blood throughout the body. Because it’s non-systemic, it does not have typical anti-depression medication side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate headache and scalp discomfort. Side effects typically occur less frequently after the first week of treatment. Yes! Transcranial magnetic stimulation is typically covered by most insurances. You can speak to one of our intake specialists to learn more about your specific plan. A TMS device sends short stimulating pulses of magnetic fields to the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. An electric current is produced by the magnetic field in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). The results show changes that may be beneficial in the treatment of depression. Initial treatment often lasts about 37 minutes, performed every day for about 4-6 weeks. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is commonly used to treat forms of depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine.\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) affects nearly eight percent of the population older than 12 years in the United States. It frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as one of the top causes of disability globally. Every day, people suffer from symptoms that cause difficulties in carrying out their activities of daily living. Thankfully, there are numerous pharmacological treatments, in addition to psychotherapy, that help many individuals lead normal lives. Unfortunately, for some individuals, their symptoms persist despite these treatments. If you are one of these individuals, you may benefit from non-medication-based interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. What Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS? Since its approval by the FDA in 2008, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an enticing treatment for depression. It is a non-invasive treatment that can be used by itself or in conjunction with psychotherapy and medication. Typically an electromagnetic coil is placed just above the left temple to deliver magnetic pulses. It helps stimulate cortical neurons to improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. The goal is to activate the areas of the brain with decreased activity that can be contributing to depression or other mental health symptoms. How Can I Determine if TMS Could Work for Me? Many factors go into treating depression, and a personalized treatment plan developed with a doctor is required to treat it effectively. Here are a couple of valuable points to consider when determining if TMS is right for you. ● Medication Side Effects\nMedications used to treat depression can have intolerable side effects such as sleep problems, GI upset, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. These side effects can have a minor impact on your daily life or can be debilitating in more extreme cases. On the other hand, TMS has little to no short-term side effects. The most common side effect reported has been scalp discomfort from the coil placement during the period of active stimulation. The worst side effect would be the occasional headaches that occur while acclimating to the stimulation and resolve shortly within starting treatment. There have been no long-term side effects reported due to TMS therapy other than continued relief from depression symptoms. ● No Relief\nMany medications treat depression and approximately half of patients will respond to the first antidepressant treatment. However, up to 40% of patients with depression do not experience relief from their symptoms with medications at all. Consequently, their diagnosis may change to treatment-resistant depression. If a patient has taken two or more full anti-depression medication courses as prescribed, they can be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They do need to take it at the full dose considered effective for the entire length of time, often up to 14 weeks. If you fall into this category, non-medication treatment routes should be explored, including TMS therapy. NeuroStim TMS treatment results are encouraging. Since 2018, NeuroStim TMS have performed over 65,000 successful TMS treatments and over 70% of our patients have experienced greater than 50% improvement in their depressive symptoms. Additionally, 46% have achieved full remission. Even if you are not diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, you may find that you only achieve partial relief from medication, and TMS can further improve symptoms. When used alongside psychotherapy, it often has the most significant impact to help develop coping strategies for your symptoms in these scenarios. While some medications are categorized as safe to be taken when pregnant, most patients planning to become pregnant need to discontinue their antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, this is a risk for the patient and her baby. TMS may be an excellent non-pharmacological option during this time. ● Medical History\nUnfortunately, if you have been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, you are not a candidate for TMS therapy due to the risks seizures pose. Additionally, if you have brain or neural implants, permanent metal in the body, or previous brain damage from illness or injury, TMS treatment may not be safe for you. Talk with your doctor about your medical history before beginning a course of treatment. If you have previously undergone TMS treatment and found it ineffective, that can change. As your depression, diagnosis, and body change, you may find you are more responsive to TMS therapy than in the past.\n\nTMS Therapy safety and tolerability\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy (TMS) is safe and easy to tolerate. Because it is not a depression drug, NeuroStar TMS Therapy does not have the same side effects that are associated with traditional antidepressant medications. More than 1.6 million treatments have been performed with NeuroStar, further proving its safety and tolerability record.5,12\nNeuroStar TMS Therapy Side Effects\nIn clinical trials, fewer than 5% of people discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The most common side effect was temporary pain or discomfort at or near the treatment site during therapy that usually resolves within the first week of treatment.1,2\nPeople should notify their doctor if they experience worsening depression symptoms, signs, or symptoms of suicidal behavior and\/or unusual behavior. Family members and support individuals should also be aware of the need to observe their loved ones and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen.5\nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy (TMS) should not be used with people who have non-removable conductive metal or stimulator implants in or near the head or people who have active or inactive implants such as deep brain stimulators, cochlear implants, and vagus nerve stimulators.5\nIs TransformHealth right for you?\n\nCommonly asked questions about Transcranila Magnetic Stimlation (TMS) answered by Dr. Daniel Press, Director, TMS Clinical Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center:\nWhat is TMS? TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven't seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined \"markedly after the first week.\" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments. Our staff will assist you in contacting your insurance company about coverage. Where do I call for more information?

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include:\n2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles\n3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation\nYou can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions:\nYou are pregnant or planning to get pregnant\nThere is an implanted medical device in the body\nYou have a history of seizures\nThere is brain damage from past injury or illness\nYou suffer from frequent headaches\nTo ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:006fbb26-e254-4535-8f97-45999dcce05e>"]},{"passage":"A therapist helps patients identify their triggers and develop healthy coping mechanisms to prevent future episodes. How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you.

TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants? If you would like to stop or reduce the dosage of antidepressants you are taking, consult with your doctor.

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes in the brain that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, among others that are commonly found with antidepressant drugs. The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required.

It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide.

TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields.

TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven't seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined \"markedly after the first week.\" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments. Our staff will assist you in contacting your insurance company about coverage. Where do I call for more information?

Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.” The “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.” As aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist. He’ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper’s new attempt at Cole’s attention in the video below.

He stated that the game just changes, and pointed to the financially elevated lifestyle that rap has afforded artists today as a sign of growth.","answer":"French Montana, in a 2017 interview with DJ Phocus for Focus Hip Hop, shared his thoughts on the evolution of hip-hop and its different generations. He noted that the culture of Hip Hop is spreading worldwide and cannot slow down, as communities everywhere have their unique expressions of Hip Hop and topics they wish to discuss. Regarding Rap music in the United States, he pointed out that the current situation involves many individuals identifying as rappers, leading to a saturated market where the longevity of a rapper's career might only last a few months. He highlighted the need for more variety in the genre to keep it sustainable and interesting.\n\nMontana mentioned several prominent figures in hip-hop who represent their unique perspectives and styles, such as The Common, T.I., Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Lupe Fiasco. He expressed that the genre could become interesting if it continues to diversify, implying that the future of hip-hop lies in embracing variety and new expressions.\n\nWhen discussing where hip-hop will be in 15-20 years, French Montana suggested that while the culture will always exist, it may evolve into a new form of expression, possibly returning to melodies and songs, indicating a potential shift in the musical style and focus of hip-hop.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Everyone I had worked with on my early projects is gone -- they’ve all been fired and there are new guys coming in that think they can teach old dogs new tricks. They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.\n\n“What we’re gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time.”\n— Troglodite, by the Jimmy Castor Bunch\nHip-Hop has always been hyper-conscious about its roots, maybe because it began with young people playing, and then rapping over, older music. Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http:\/\/rap.genius.com\/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow\nToday the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ\/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common\nIn this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nHip-hop is more than just music. The term encompasses a whole culture, and that helps explain how it has become one of the most influential elements shaping global entertainment and youth self-expression. All over the world, hip-hop is a tool for explaining the complexities of daily life and speaking truth to power, whether through spoken lyrics, graffiti art, dance or disc jockey mastery. Not to be confused with commercial rap — which often glorifies material excess, violence and misogyny — hip-hop was born in the South Bronx, New York, more than 40 years ago as an alternative to self-destructive gang culture. Hip-hop gave disaffected youth in impoverished neighborhoods an opportunity to channel their frustrations into art rather than violence. In a rented Sedgwick Avenue recreation room on August 11, 1973, a Jamaican-born DJ named Kool Herc debuted the art of separating the breakbeat from recorded songs and extending it using two turntables that were playing the same record. Herc's friend Coke La Rock began rapping over the infectious beats. The sound sparked an instant revolution, and it was soon being recreated at parties all over the South Bronx. The extended breakbeat also encouraged the evolution of break dancing, in addition to rapping, and graffiti artists offered a visual complement to the musical and dance performance. \"Culture doesn't begin on a single day, but events can happen on a single day that put a lot of things in motion,\" says Ben Ortiz, assistant curator of Cornell University's Hip Hop Collection in Ithaca, New York. The university has been preserving hip-hop artifacts and recordings since 2007 and boasts the largest collection of its kind in the world. Cornell's curator of rare books and manuscripts, Katherine Reagan, says the university not only is preserving the story of hip-hop's beginnings, but also giving its originators and new artists a chance to tell the story to students and community youth organizations, as well as musicologists. \"We want to give this living culture a voice because the originators of that culture are by and large still alive and we want to include them in this process of documentation while we still can,\" she said. Cornell has recruited hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa as a visiting scholar. The South Bronx DJ and founder of the hip-hop awareness group the Universal Zulu Nation chose the term \"hip-hop\" as the name for the culture and identified its core elements as rapping or emceeing, breakbeat deejaying, break dancing (b-boying and b-girling) and graffiti art. \"The fifth element that Afrika Bambataa described is knowledge, and hip-hop's art forms are the tools to achieve it,\" Ortiz said. \"Knowledge, in this case, means an awareness, a consciousness and understanding about the world and understanding of yourself, your history and heritage and the heritage of other people.\" Hip-hop grew to include techniques such as vocal percussion, known as beat boxing, and vinyl scratching, and through recordings such as the Sugarhill Gang's 1979 hit \"Rapper's Delight,\" its fan base began to expand from the urban African-American, Afro-Caribbean and Latino communities of the South Bronx to include suburban American kids of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Today, without question, hip-hop is a global phenomenon. Break dance moves have spread to countries that only recently have been connected to the Internet, and rap lyrics are being spoken in nearly every language. Easily adapting hip-hop to their own cultures, young artists worldwide are using it to express themselves, as bluntly or as eloquently as they prefer, making statements on anything from love and abandonment to poverty and corruption. Noting hip-hop's amazing growth from its roots in the South Bronx, Bambaataa said the culture \"has brought more people together than all the politicians on Earth put together.\"\n\nand MTV's Sway Calloway provides: \"The detail that manufactured that period so wonderful is that absolutely nothing was contrived. Every thing was even now becoming discovered and anything was however revolutionary and new\". [one zero five] Author William Jelani Cobb suggests \"what produced the era they inaugurated deserving of your expression golden was the sheer quantity of stylistic improvements that arrived into existence. The 2008 Broadway production fused salsa and hip hop types, and involved rap. Miranda introduced hip hop to Richard Rogers Theater a second time in 2015 with his creation Hamilton. The demonstrate had box Business success. Hamilton and Within the Heights bundled rap as well as the cast recording of Hamilton created a number 1 album on the Billboard rap charts. The success of Hamilton reveals that hip hop might have a vital job in musical theater. [a hundred and seventy] Innovation and revitalization\nIn late 1979, Debbie Harry of Blondie took Nile Rodgers of Stylish to these types of an occasion, as the most crucial backing monitor made use of was the split from Stylish's \"Very good Situations\". The new model motivated Harry, and Blondie's afterwards hit one from 1981 \"Rapture\" became the 1st key single containing hip hop factors by a white team or artist to strike primary over the U. ..they have accomplished movies about nurse killers and Trainer killers and pupil killers. [Actor] Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops because the Terminator. But I do not hear anybody complaining about that.\" In exactly the same interview, Ice-T instructed to Philips which the misunderstanding of Cop Killer plus the tries to censor it experienced racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court suggests It really is OK to get a white male to melt away a cross in community. But nobody would like a black man to write a file about a cop killer.\" Occasional data—such as Grandmaster Flash's \"The Message\" in 1982 and Operate-DMC's \"It is Like That\" in 1984—received vital approval, but rap, typically, was dismissed being a passing fancy—far too repetitious, way too 1 dimensional. Still rap did not disappear, and an explosion of Strength and creativeness within the late eighties leaves rap these days as arguably the most very important new street-oriented audio in pop since the start of rock inside the fifties. Lots of individuals are unaware that Perry Ellis aided launch the streetwear scene with its typical Perry Ellis The usa sub-line that premiered back again in 1984, but now It really is back again to point out us how the OGs are having points... Examine Post\nHip hop as both a musical genre along with a tradition was shaped in the course of the seventies when block functions grew to become ever more preferred in Ny city, significantly among African-American youth residing in the Bronx. Nevertheless hip-hop music did not get officially recorded for the radio or television to play till 1979, largely on account of poverty for the duration of hip-hop's start and not enough acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods. At block events DJs played percussive breaks of well-liked tunes utilizing two turntables as well as a DJ mixer to be able to Enjoy breaks from two copies of a similar history, alternating from one to another and lengthening the \"split\". [sixteen] Hip hop's early evolution happened as sampling technologies and drum devices turned extensively offered and affordable. Turntablist strategies for example scratching and beatmatching formulated combined Ateo Feo with the breaks and Jamaican toasting, a chanting vocal type, was applied over the beats. In Tanzania inside the early 2000s, community hip hop artists became well-known by infusing regional models of Afrobeat and arabesque melodies, dancehall and hip-hop beats with Swahili lyrics. Rap linguistics\nHip hop as music and tradition fashioned in the course of the 1970s in Ny city in the multicultural Trade in between African-American youth from America and young immigrants and youngsters of immigrants from nations during the Caribbean. Hip hop music in its infancy is called an outlet plus a voice for the disenfranchised youth of marginalized backgrounds and lower-income regions, as the hip hop lifestyle mirrored the social, economic and political realities in their lives.\n\nspawned a new breed of rapper, styled as gun-toting hoodlum supposedly giving suburban America a frightening peek into ghetto life the group knew from pretty early on that about 80 percent of the people buying their albums were white, middle-class kids. Although the industry was happy to cash in, pressure by conservative advocacy groups on major corporations such as Time Warner (parent company of TIME.com) resulted in the industry backing away from promoting gangsta rap. \"Hip-Hop Nation\" includes original correspondence detailing efforts by Ice-T to be released from his Warner Brothers contract after the corporation had sought to curb certain lyrics. Gangsta rap, with its narrative tales and its cinematic funk-driven sound, offered a distinct alternative to the tricky bebop gymnastics of the freestyling East Coast. But hip-hop came close to destroying itself in the mid-'90s when that bicoastal rivalry almost turned into a shooting war, as Tupac Shakur between surviving shootings and spells in prison threatened the life of Brooklyn rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and both men, former friends, were by the end of 1997 dead in as-yet-unsolved drive-by shootings. But while most hip-hop fans today may be well versed in the tale of Tupac and Biggie, the show transports them back to an era they may find hard to imagine. After all, the almost pharaonic fantasy world of a Puffy Combs video is light-years away from the hand-stenciled mimeographs with crude sketches advertising an around-the-way appearance of Kurtis Blow or a block party featuring Grandmaster Flash. This was a do-it yourself movement in the outer boroughs, a culture being built by hand, brick by brick one to which the suits running the music industry in the glass towers across the river were mostly impervious for more than a decade. And for kids grown accustomed to hip-hop as the bearer of grim tales of death and destruction, \"Hip-Hop Nation\" offers a glimpse of a reminder that the cultural roots were in joyous block parties and people having getting together to have a good time no matter how grim their circumstances. That much is summed up in the words of one pioneering DJ carried in a video installation: \"If there was negativity and fights breaking out at your party, that means your DJ was whack.\" IT WAS AT THOSE PARTIES in the \"Boogie Down\" South Bronx where hip-hop's founding fathers Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grandmaster Flash first began delivering spoken rhymes over the break beats on funk and disco records sometime in the mid-'70s. Today the signature beats-and-rhymes combination of the musical art form they created is as ubiquitous in America's tony suburbs as in its forgotten housing projects, and has kids in distant parts of the world whose first language may be French or Japanese or Wolof chanting choruses inviting their friends to \"get at me, dawg.\" Hip-hop's language not simply its slang, which is as likely to be heard in Yale dorm rooms as on inner-city street corners, but its idiom, which involves combining the spoken (or screamed) word with a pastiche of musical elements drawn from previous songs and styles reassembled in new and unique combinations is not only the preeminent musical genre of a generation, it's also a complex, ever-evolving organism that has spawned countless dialects that are constantly in conversation with one another. HIP-HOP CULTURE may be difficult to define, but it is pervasive nonetheless. It began simply as a combination of four art forms deejaying, rapping, break dancing and graffiti tagging but it quickly evolved into a cultural revolution in which young African-Americans literally remade their America. In the spirit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, they didn't simply demand to be admitted as an equal in Whitey's world; they created their own popular culture grounded in the lived reality and aspirations of black life in America. Far from demanding to join the club, the hip-hop kids created their own. And once they'd built it, Whitey came, desperately seeking access to the \"cool\" that, as Norman Mailer famously noted, has in postwar urban America been inexorably associated with blackness.\n\nAvailable for all styles: Electro, Techno, Hip-Hop, Dub, Dubstep, Dancehall, Trap, Trance.

What is hip hop? “Hip Hop is still fundamentally an art form that traffics in hyperbole, parody, kitsch, dramatic license, double entendres, signification, and other literary and artistic conventions to get its point across.” Michael Eric Dyson, scholar (Dyson 2007: xvii)\n“Hip-Hop does not make it exceptionally endearing to me by the attitude that the menfolk have towards the women. It’s very difficult to hold your head up with dignity when guys are looking at you like you just some b*tch or a hoe. It’s not exactly a fun kind of subculture for the women. It’s all good for the men that get to be machismo and posture and strut about, that’s all good. But the ladies…it’s very hard.” Lady Pink, graffiti writer (quoted in Aqua)\n“Hip-hop was born in New York City in the mid-1970s as a vehicle for inner-city youth to throw parties on their blocks and at area clubs, and for them to make money as DJs and promoters.” Kevin Powell, writer (Powell)\n“According to one ex-high Satanist, it is identical with the voodoo chants and rituals used within Satanism to summon up demons of lust and violence.” Jack Chick, Battle Cry newspaper (Small 1992: 4)\n“Hip and Hop is more than musicHip is the knowledgeHop is the movementHip and Hop is intelligent movement” KRS-One and Marley Marl lyrics to song “Hip Hop Lives”\n“Hip-hop, everybody’s allowed to come in it, because it’s a street thing. I heard someone say, ‘Frank Ocean hip-hop artist.’ He is, hip-hop loves Frank Ocean, he’s our brother, but [he’s not a hip-hop artist]. Miguel is not a hip-hop artist.

This is the third interview I’ve ever done, and I think it’s the best one I’ve done so far. If you haven’t checked out my review of (((echo chamber))), you’re fuckin’ up. Shoutout to Mello Music Group for putting it out. Hello, good sir. Would you be interested in doing an interview for Focus Hip Hop? “Excitement.” How many languages have you tried to learn? Only a few. Wish I knew them all. The most helpful thing I learned in the hospital was body language. How did you get a citation in the Oxford English Dictionary. I was recognized for an accomplishment; pretty straightforward. How do you speak body language? Emotions. “Acting.” When did you overcome nerves? Does anyone ever? It appears that way to many? We’re asking too many deep questions. Which acting gestures did you have to be taught or relearn? Believe the message. “I know everything.”\nOkay, so these things apply to ALL gestures slash communicaziones. Let’s do a collaborative illustration for this interview. Good idea. I’ll draw my words. What are the most boring compliments you receive? I can’t complain about compliments, but I will say this. My old friend Brian Gibson once said, “People will like you for the wrong reasons. That’s something you’ll have to deal with.” No idea what he meant at the time, but mind blowing soon after. Understandable. Who’s your favorite writer? What kind of work does he write? Novels, poetry, and anthologies. Who’s your favorite writer? He writes at top levels in so many formats. It’s incredible. He’s who I aspire to be. Okay, I want to add George Carlin to my list. Prophetic. And Lao Tzu. Important names are being said. None more important than you, DJ Phocus. I appreciate that. Confidence is lacking by most people my age. Why and how do you know that’s true? I’m mentally ill.\nYou’re not alone in that, but are you generalizing that your generation is too? Funny. You’re smart. What did you think of (((Age War)))? Didn’t experience one. What is it? It’s on my album! For what it’s worth, I felt that way as a kid before you were born, so there goes the generation gap. “Thanksgiving.” Do you philosophize? You mean philosophize about thanksgiving? In general, what are the hardest questions to which you search for answers? 1. Can we instill values without religion? 2. How do we get rid of money? 3. Can I be a great dad & a great artist at the same time? 4. How do we prepare for climate collapse? 5. How do I bring people closer to oneness? 6. You got any answers for those? 7. Should I follow up Re-Thankskilling? 1. Doubted by most. 2. Be manipulative. 3. Yes. 4. Study Earth. 5. Role models. 6. Everyone has an “answer.” 7. Depends on inspiration. Just try your best. Any trauma in your life? Elaborate. Never mind, that’s kind of a rude command. Define “horror.” Personally…\nJeez, that sounds terrible for everyone involved. I stumbled on an article last night about greater mental health problems generally in younger generations. Hard to believe it’s not all pervasive, but I guess I really don’t know. Anyway, I have to wrap up this interview, DJ Phocus. Thanks for reaching out!!! Of course. Thank you for your participation. Yo. I would like to apologize for being resistant to the idea that mental illness is only getting worse. I actually know it is, but wanted to pretend otherwise so I could be less scared for my kids. Don’t worry, man. I understand. if you don't share this article i will hunt you down\n\nQuestion: Where is hip-hop headed? Wyclef Jean: I think the culture of Hip Hop is spreading through the world and it can’t -- it can’t slow down because what happened is every place there’s communities, and all these communities have they own expression of Hip Hop and what they wanna talk about. I think Rap music in the States -- you know we’re in a situation right now where we’re trying to figure out what it is, you know what I’m saying, because every other person is a Rapper. So what’s gonna determine, you know, your life as a rapper? Every other person’s a rapper, every other person’s talking about Jews, every other person’s talking about champagne, every other person’s talking about they rims and they’re grills. That’s every other person. So, like, the lifespan of a Rapper now is probably eight months. So we’re like, “Yo, where’s the actual go,” you know what I’m saying? So it’s like, you know, you still got the Commons, you know. You’d have -- you still have people that represents they side. T.I. represents his side, Lil Wayne has his side, you know, Common, Kanye, you know what I’m saying; Lupe Fiasco just came and claimed his side. So I think, you know, it could get interesting, but we just need more variety so that it could be sustainable. Because if we don’t get more variety, then what’s gonna end up happening is it’s just gonna get boring. Question: Where do you see hip-hop in 15-20 years? Wyclef Jean: In 15, 20 years, you know, Hip Hop will always be around, the culture will be around, but it will be in a new form of a new expression, and it’s probably gonna go back to melodies and songs.\n\nI take the same approach when I make music, so I’ll often start out by singing a melody and then I convert that to another sound—or sometimes I’ll keep it as a vocal, and fill the same melody with lyrics. The practice of doing that helps me come up with new ideas. And sometimes the only thing you may have with you [to] get an idea is your voice and your iPhone... Exactly. Or that might just be the quickest way of doing it, if I don’t know how to play that specific chord off the top of my head. I still do that a lot actually. You moved around a lot when you were growing up, before eventually setting in Minnesota and graduating there—and I remember reading before that the whole experience of attending all these different schools often made you feel like an outsider, naturally. I was wondering if you could explain that period of your life? Yeah man, we moved around a lot because of my mom’s work as a scientist. I probably moved something like 7 times, but it was all the same northern region of the country—Florida, New York, Minnesota, etc. I guess it was just a case of finding the right spot to settle in. My mom came from a different country, then I was born in another country and then we both moved to a new country together—so it was always a case of fitting in, the same as when anyone moves to a new place or a new school or a new job. Would you say that outsider perspective is something that follows you into hip-hop? Your music certainly stands out from the crowd, but how do you feel about the hip-hop community? Do you hang out with other rappers? I hear other rappers be like, “Man, I hate rappers. I don’t fuck with rappers...”—but honestly, I’m down to hang out with whoever has good vibes. If anything, I feel like a lot of rappers don’t fuck with me! I’m like that kid at school that’s like, “Yo, let’s hang out, let’s play video games,” and all the other kids are just like, “Nah”. Sometimes I feel like that, but as I get older, I’m realizing that whoever I naturally connect with will just happen, you know? My sound is a reflection of my real life, so if I sound like an outsider, that’s because I feel like that—that just reflects in my music. I hear that. On a similar note, when you listen to some rappers, you can tell by their delivery that they only listen to rap. You don’t strike me as one of those guys, in fact I can hear an eclectic mix of influences in your sound. I have these time periods where I listen to a lot of the same thing at once, so right now I’m listening to a lot of reggae—but it changes. I always go back to hip-hop, but I think that’s just because when I was growing up, I found hip-hop when I moved to the US. A lot of rappers my age were born into a world where hip-hop already existed, where it was more familiar, but for me, it was just another tool that I could use to express myself. “I like to say I’m optimistic rather than positive.”\nLet’s track back that two-year time period between Future Memoirs and Northern Lights. In between those two records, you had the whole Kanye thing, debuting your feature on “All Day” live at the Brit Awards here in London. I was wondering what it was like coming back to perform in the city this time around—considering the last time you played here was on that award show stage. It’s cool, because the Brit Awards was like I got invited to someone else’s party—which still felt like it was my moment—but it was more of a unifying experience for everybody. No one else will ever understand what that meant for me as an artist, or the grime scene, or for hip-hop—that whole message that we sent out. The best thing was just feeling like I was part of something. This time felt way more familiar. I was playing to the people that I know listen to my music, so it felt like we knew each other. It just felt like I was hanging out with my friends. For an artist, that’s the perfect vibe. I feel like you give off a pretty positive vibe in person too. I’m sure that plays a part in connecting with your fans. I like to say I’m optimistic rather than positive. Everybody is fucked up in a certain way.","passages":[{"passage":"Everyone I had worked with on my early projects is gone -- they’ve all been fired and there are new guys coming in that think they can teach old dogs new tricks. They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7a388a19-2a38-4b87-ada3-db14ec5ac33e>"]},{"passage":"“What we’re gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time.”\n— Troglodite, by the Jimmy Castor Bunch\nHip-Hop has always been hyper-conscious about its roots, maybe because it began with young people playing, and then rapping over, older music. Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http:\/\/rap.genius.com\/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow\nToday the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ\/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common\nIn this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e0611a38-30c6-490a-b139-1622d0c33d9e>"]},{"passage":"Hip-hop is more than just music. The term encompasses a whole culture, and that helps explain how it has become one of the most influential elements shaping global entertainment and youth self-expression. All over the world, hip-hop is a tool for explaining the complexities of daily life and speaking truth to power, whether through spoken lyrics, graffiti art, dance or disc jockey mastery. Not to be confused with commercial rap — which often glorifies material excess, violence and misogyny — hip-hop was born in the South Bronx, New York, more than 40 years ago as an alternative to self-destructive gang culture. Hip-hop gave disaffected youth in impoverished neighborhoods an opportunity to channel their frustrations into art rather than violence. In a rented Sedgwick Avenue recreation room on August 11, 1973, a Jamaican-born DJ named Kool Herc debuted the art of separating the breakbeat from recorded songs and extending it using two turntables that were playing the same record. Herc's friend Coke La Rock began rapping over the infectious beats. The sound sparked an instant revolution, and it was soon being recreated at parties all over the South Bronx. The extended breakbeat also encouraged the evolution of break dancing, in addition to rapping, and graffiti artists offered a visual complement to the musical and dance performance. \"Culture doesn't begin on a single day, but events can happen on a single day that put a lot of things in motion,\" says Ben Ortiz, assistant curator of Cornell University's Hip Hop Collection in Ithaca, New York. The university has been preserving hip-hop artifacts and recordings since 2007 and boasts the largest collection of its kind in the world. Cornell's curator of rare books and manuscripts, Katherine Reagan, says the university not only is preserving the story of hip-hop's beginnings, but also giving its originators and new artists a chance to tell the story to students and community youth organizations, as well as musicologists. \"We want to give this living culture a voice because the originators of that culture are by and large still alive and we want to include them in this process of documentation while we still can,\" she said. Cornell has recruited hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa as a visiting scholar. The South Bronx DJ and founder of the hip-hop awareness group the Universal Zulu Nation chose the term \"hip-hop\" as the name for the culture and identified its core elements as rapping or emceeing, breakbeat deejaying, break dancing (b-boying and b-girling) and graffiti art. \"The fifth element that Afrika Bambataa described is knowledge, and hip-hop's art forms are the tools to achieve it,\" Ortiz said. \"Knowledge, in this case, means an awareness, a consciousness and understanding about the world and understanding of yourself, your history and heritage and the heritage of other people.\" Hip-hop grew to include techniques such as vocal percussion, known as beat boxing, and vinyl scratching, and through recordings such as the Sugarhill Gang's 1979 hit \"Rapper's Delight,\" its fan base began to expand from the urban African-American, Afro-Caribbean and Latino communities of the South Bronx to include suburban American kids of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Today, without question, hip-hop is a global phenomenon. Break dance moves have spread to countries that only recently have been connected to the Internet, and rap lyrics are being spoken in nearly every language. Easily adapting hip-hop to their own cultures, young artists worldwide are using it to express themselves, as bluntly or as eloquently as they prefer, making statements on anything from love and abandonment to poverty and corruption. Noting hip-hop's amazing growth from its roots in the South Bronx, Bambaataa said the culture \"has brought more people together than all the politicians on Earth put together.\"","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d7565f4f-a25b-484c-bc3e-01f2c279b7f9>"]},{"passage":"and MTV's Sway Calloway provides: \"The detail that manufactured that period so wonderful is that absolutely nothing was contrived.

Although the industry was happy to cash in, pressure by conservative advocacy groups on major corporations such as Time Warner (parent company of TIME.com) resulted in the industry backing away from promoting gangsta rap. \"Hip-Hop Nation\" includes original correspondence detailing efforts by Ice-T to be released from his Warner Brothers contract after the corporation had sought to curb certain lyrics. Gangsta rap, with its narrative tales and its cinematic funk-driven sound, offered a distinct alternative to the tricky bebop gymnastics of the freestyling East Coast. But hip-hop came close to destroying itself in the mid-'90s when that bicoastal rivalry almost turned into a shooting war, as Tupac Shakur between surviving shootings and spells in prison threatened the life of Brooklyn rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and both men, former friends, were by the end of 1997 dead in as-yet-unsolved drive-by shootings. But while most hip-hop fans today may be well versed in the tale of Tupac and Biggie, the show transports them back to an era they may find hard to imagine. After all, the almost pharaonic fantasy world of a Puffy Combs video is light-years away from the hand-stenciled mimeographs with crude sketches advertising an around-the-way appearance of Kurtis Blow or a block party featuring Grandmaster Flash. This was a do-it yourself movement in the outer boroughs, a culture being built by hand, brick by brick one to which the suits running the music industry in the glass towers across the river were mostly impervious for more than a decade. And for kids grown accustomed to hip-hop as the bearer of grim tales of death and destruction, \"Hip-Hop Nation\" offers a glimpse of a reminder that the cultural roots were in joyous block parties and people having getting together to have a good time no matter how grim their circumstances. That much is summed up in the words of one pioneering DJ carried in a video installation: \"If there was negativity and fights breaking out at your party, that means your DJ was whack.\" IT WAS AT THOSE PARTIES in the \"Boogie Down\" South Bronx where hip-hop's founding fathers Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grandmaster Flash first began delivering spoken rhymes over the break beats on funk and disco records sometime in the mid-'70s. Today the signature beats-and-rhymes combination of the musical art form they created is as ubiquitous in America's tony suburbs as in its forgotten housing projects, and has kids in distant parts of the world whose first language may be French or Japanese or Wolof chanting choruses inviting their friends to \"get at me, dawg.\" Hip-hop's language not simply its slang, which is as likely to be heard in Yale dorm rooms as on inner-city street corners, but its idiom, which involves combining the spoken (or screamed) word with a pastiche of musical elements drawn from previous songs and styles reassembled in new and unique combinations is not only the preeminent musical genre of a generation, it's also a complex, ever-evolving organism that has spawned countless dialects that are constantly in conversation with one another. HIP-HOP CULTURE may be difficult to define, but it is pervasive nonetheless. It began simply as a combination of four art forms deejaying, rapping, break dancing and graffiti tagging but it quickly evolved into a cultural revolution in which young African-Americans literally remade their America. In the spirit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, they didn't simply demand to be admitted as an equal in Whitey's world; they created their own popular culture grounded in the lived reality and aspirations of black life in America. Far from demanding to join the club, the hip-hop kids created their own. And once they'd built it, Whitey came, desperately seeking access to the \"cool\" that, as Norman Mailer famously noted, has in postwar urban America been inexorably associated with blackness.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4186a596-cbc5-4679-858a-47c8818bb34f>"]},{"passage":"Available for all styles: Electro, Techno, Hip-Hop, Dub, Dubstep, Dancehall, Trap, Trance.

What is hip hop? “Hip Hop is still fundamentally an art form that traffics in hyperbole, parody, kitsch, dramatic license, double entendres, signification, and other literary and artistic conventions to get its point across.” Michael Eric Dyson, scholar (Dyson 2007: xvii)\n“Hip-Hop does not make it exceptionally endearing to me by the attitude that the menfolk have towards the women. It’s very difficult to hold your head up with dignity when guys are looking at you like you just some b*tch or a hoe. It’s not exactly a fun kind of subculture for the women. It’s all good for the men that get to be machismo and posture and strut about, that’s all good. But the ladies…it’s very hard.” Lady Pink, graffiti writer (quoted in Aqua)\n“Hip-hop was born in New York City in the mid-1970s as a vehicle for inner-city youth to throw parties on their blocks and at area clubs, and for them to make money as DJs and promoters.” Kevin Powell, writer (Powell)\n“According to one ex-high Satanist, it is identical with the voodoo chants and rituals used within Satanism to summon up demons of lust and violence.” Jack Chick, Battle Cry newspaper (Small 1992: 4)\n“Hip and Hop is more than musicHip is the knowledgeHop is the movementHip and Hop is intelligent movement” KRS-One and Marley Marl lyrics to song “Hip Hop Lives”\n“Hip-hop, everybody’s allowed to come in it, because it’s a street thing. I heard someone say, ‘Frank Ocean hip-hop artist.’ He is, hip-hop loves Frank Ocean, he’s our brother, but [he’s not a hip-hop artist]. Miguel is not a hip-hop artist. Trey Songz is not a hip-hop artist. They’re singers.” Nas (Bené Viera)\n” Hip Hop music is made from black, brown, yellow, red, white—whatever music that gives you the grunt, that funk, that groove or that beat. It’s all part of hip hop.” Afrika Bambaataa, DJ (Davy D)\n“Hip-hop is about youth and the young at heart.” Kool Herc, DJ (Mao 2013: 66)\nPart 2: Drawing on 2-4 of the definitions provided above and chapters 1-5 of our text book Rap and Hip Hop Culture (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015) complete the following 4 steps which contain strict guidelines and some (semi-open ended) questions to develop an argument to help you explain the different ideas community members and media critics have about “hip hop.”\n(0-5 points) In one paragraph, set your tone and inform your reader that you are about to address the complex and inconsistent ways “we” have defined and misused the terms “hip hop” and “rap.” Can you do it in an interesting way to draw a reader to continue reading your work? Required elements:\nFocus on 2-4 examples as opposed to responding to every definition on the list. What background information does your reader need to know in order to understand your claim? (example: why it is necessary to address definitions. Or how key terms are used and abused. Or …)\nWho does “we” represent? Your last sentence should be your claim. (0-7.5 points) In following 2-3 paragraphs, problematize(to view as a problem to solve) a couple of the definitions. Introduce your evidence to prove your claim. NOTE: Your opinion alone is not sufficient. Instead, you must draw on the other definitions from this group to help support your argument and draw on the data from your text book and\/or you may draw on other academically sound materials and include that source in your WORKS CITED page.

Recognize your own biases: I am young and a current fan of hip hop culture. OR I am an older fan and perhaps romanticize the past too much. OR I am male and might ignore the ways it has impacted female participants.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f0d4b13a-a81c-48f3-b3dc-575826182d41>"]},{"passage":"This interview took place on June 24th. This is the third interview I’ve ever done, and I think it’s the best one I’ve done so far. If you haven’t checked out my review of (((echo chamber))), you’re fuckin’ up. Shoutout to Mello Music Group for putting it out. Hello, good sir. Would you be interested in doing an interview for Focus Hip Hop? “Excitement.” How many languages have you tried to learn? Only a few. Wish I knew them all. The most helpful thing I learned in the hospital was body language. How did you get a citation in the Oxford English Dictionary. I was recognized for an accomplishment; pretty straightforward. How do you speak body language? Emotions. “Acting.” When did you overcome nerves? Does anyone ever? It appears that way to many? We’re asking too many deep questions. Which acting gestures did you have to be taught or relearn? Believe the message. “I know everything.”\nOkay, so these things apply to ALL gestures slash communicaziones. Let’s do a collaborative illustration for this interview. Good idea. I’ll draw my words. What are the most boring compliments you receive? I can’t complain about compliments, but I will say this. My old friend Brian Gibson once said, “People will like you for the wrong reasons. That’s something you’ll have to deal with.” No idea what he meant at the time, but mind blowing soon after. Understandable. Who’s your favorite writer? What kind of work does he write? Novels, poetry, and anthologies. Who’s your favorite writer? He writes at top levels in so many formats. It’s incredible. He’s who I aspire to be. Okay, I want to add George Carlin to my list. Prophetic. And Lao Tzu. Important names are being said. None more important than you, DJ Phocus. I appreciate that. Confidence is lacking by most people my age. Why and how do you know that’s true? I’m mentally ill.\nYou’re not alone in that, but are you generalizing that your generation is too? Funny. You’re smart. What did you think of (((Age War)))? Didn’t experience one. What is it? It’s on my album! For what it’s worth, I felt that way as a kid before you were born, so there goes the generation gap. “Thanksgiving.” Do you philosophize? You mean philosophize about thanksgiving? In general, what are the hardest questions to which you search for answers? 1. Can we instill values without religion? 2. How do we get rid of money? 3. Can I be a great dad & a great artist at the same time? 4. How do we prepare for climate collapse? 5. How do I bring people closer to oneness? 6. You got any answers for those? 7. Should I follow up Re-Thankskilling? 1. Doubted by most. 2. Be manipulative. 3. Yes. 4. Study Earth. 5. Role models. 6. Everyone has an “answer.” 7. Depends on inspiration. Just try your best. Any trauma in your life? Elaborate. Never mind, that’s kind of a rude command. Define “horror.” Personally…\nJeez, that sounds terrible for everyone involved. I stumbled on an article last night about greater mental health problems generally in younger generations. Hard to believe it’s not all pervasive, but I guess I really don’t know. Anyway, I have to wrap up this interview, DJ Phocus. Thanks for reaching out!!! Of course. Thank you for your participation. Yo. I would like to apologize for being resistant to the idea that mental illness is only getting worse. I actually know it is, but wanted to pretend otherwise so I could be less scared for my kids. Don’t worry, man. I understand. if you don't share this article i will hunt you down","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5341174b-06df-4cd7-a165-61133f7ca0f7>"]},{"passage":"Question: Where is hip-hop headed? Wyclef Jean: I think the culture of Hip Hop is spreading through the world and it can’t -- it can’t slow down because what happened is every place there’s communities, and all these communities have they own expression of Hip Hop and what they wanna talk about. I think Rap music in the States -- you know we’re in a situation right now where we’re trying to figure out what it is, you know what I’m saying, because every other person is a Rapper. So what’s gonna determine, you know, your life as a rapper? Every other person’s a rapper, every other person’s talking about Jews, every other person’s talking about champagne, every other person’s talking about they rims and they’re grills. That’s every other person. So, like, the lifespan of a Rapper now is probably eight months. So we’re like, “Yo, where’s the actual go,” you know what I’m saying? So it’s like, you know, you still got the Commons, you know. You’d have -- you still have people that represents they side. T.I. represents his side, Lil Wayne has his side, you know, Common, Kanye, you know what I’m saying; Lupe Fiasco just came and claimed his side. So I think, you know, it could get interesting, but we just need more variety so that it could be sustainable. Because if we don’t get more variety, then what’s gonna end up happening is it’s just gonna get boring. Question: Where do you see hip-hop in 15-20 years? Wyclef Jean: In 15, 20 years, you know, Hip Hop will always be around, the culture will be around, but it will be in a new form of a new expression, and it’s probably gonna go back to melodies and songs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:75b99a9a-84a9-4286-be29-7e6baae50bb9>"]},{"passage":"I take the same approach when I make music, so I’ll often start out by singing a melody and then I convert that to another sound—or sometimes I’ll keep it as a vocal, and fill the same melody with lyrics. The practice of doing that helps me come up with new ideas. And sometimes the only thing you may have with you [to] get an idea is your voice and your iPhone... Exactly. Or that might just be the quickest way of doing it, if I don’t know how to play that specific chord off the top of my head. I still do that a lot actually. You moved around a lot when you were growing up, before eventually setting in Minnesota and graduating there—and I remember reading before that the whole experience of attending all these different schools often made you feel like an outsider, naturally. I was wondering if you could explain that period of your life? Yeah man, we moved around a lot because of my mom’s work as a scientist. I probably moved something like 7 times, but it was all the same northern region of the country—Florida, New York, Minnesota, etc. I guess it was just a case of finding the right spot to settle in. My mom came from a different country, then I was born in another country and then we both moved to a new country together—so it was always a case of fitting in, the same as when anyone moves to a new place or a new school or a new job. Would you say that outsider perspective is something that follows you into hip-hop? Your music certainly stands out from the crowd, but how do you feel about the hip-hop community? Do you hang out with other rappers? I hear other rappers be like, “Man, I hate rappers. I don’t fuck with rappers...”—but honestly, I’m down to hang out with whoever has good vibes. If anything, I feel like a lot of rappers don’t fuck with me! I’m like that kid at school that’s like, “Yo, let’s hang out, let’s play video games,” and all the other kids are just like, “Nah”. Sometimes I feel like that, but as I get older, I’m realizing that whoever I naturally connect with will just happen, you know? My sound is a reflection of my real life, so if I sound like an outsider, that’s because I feel like that—that just reflects in my music. I hear that. On a similar note, when you listen to some rappers, you can tell by their delivery that they only listen to rap. You don’t strike me as one of those guys, in fact I can hear an eclectic mix of influences in your sound. I have these time periods where I listen to a lot of the same thing at once, so right now I’m listening to a lot of reggae—but it changes. I always go back to hip-hop, but I think that’s just because when I was growing up, I found hip-hop when I moved to the US. A lot of rappers my age were born into a world where hip-hop already existed, where it was more familiar, but for me, it was just another tool that I could use to express myself. “I like to say I’m optimistic rather than positive.”\nLet’s track back that two-year time period between Future Memoirs and Northern Lights. In between those two records, you had the whole Kanye thing, debuting your feature on “All Day” live at the Brit Awards here in London. I was wondering what it was like coming back to perform in the city this time around—considering the last time you played here was on that award show stage. It’s cool, because the Brit Awards was like I got invited to someone else’s party—which still felt like it was my moment—but it was more of a unifying experience for everybody. No one else will ever understand what that meant for me as an artist, or the grime scene, or for hip-hop—that whole message that we sent out. The best thing was just feeling like I was part of something. This time felt way more familiar. I was playing to the people that I know listen to my music, so it felt like we knew each other. It just felt like I was hanging out with my friends. For an artist, that’s the perfect vibe. I feel like you give off a pretty positive vibe in person too. I’m sure that plays a part in connecting with your fans. I like to say I’m optimistic rather than positive. Everybody is fucked up in a certain way.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dfec4e5f-e848-424d-9d47-65a82118916f>"]}]}

(Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?","gold":"The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars. They prevented slipping on difficult terrain and enabled soldiers to both hold their ground and advance effectively, as a retreating army rarely wins wars, while an army that can advance and take ground is more likely to be victorious.","answer":"The Roman military footwear, known as caligae, was distinctive for its low-cut design and the use of hobnails or small metal studs on the soles. These hobnails served multiple purposes, primarily enhancing traction and durability.\n\nStrategically, the spiked soles of the caligae were important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Traction:** The spikes provided better grip on various terrains, especially on wet, muddy, or uneven ground. This was crucial for Roman soldiers who needed to maintain stability during marches, battles, and maneuvers.\n\n2. **Durability:** The hobnails extended the life of the sandals by protecting the leather soles from wear and tear, which was essential given the extensive distances Roman soldiers often had to cover on foot.\n\n3. **Defensive Advantage:** In combat, the spikes could provide a slight defensive advantage by making it more difficult for opponents to trip or pull the soldier's feet out from under them.\n\n4. **Offensive Potential:** In close combat, the spikes could also be used offensively, as soldiers could kick or stomp with their feet, potentially causing injury to their enemies.\n\n5. **Standardization:** The use of hobnails was part of the standardized equipment that helped maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the Roman military. Uniformity in footwear ensured that all soldiers could operate effectively as part of a cohesive unit.\n\nIn summary, the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear lay in their ability to enhance the soldier's mobility, durability, and combat effectiveness across various terrains and situations.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism. This article is part of the series on:\nMilitary of ancient Rome (portal)\n753 BC – AD 476\nStructural history Roman army (unit types and ranks, legions, auxiliaries, generals) Roman navy (fleets, admirals) Campaign history Lists of wars and battles Decorations and punishments Technological history Military engineering (castra, siege engines, arches, roads) Political history Strategy and tactics Infantry tactics Frontiers and fortifications (limes, Hadrian's Wall)\nThe structural history of the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.\n\nRome began as a collection of villages on several hills near the river Tiber. Life there was neither comfortable, nor safe. War was always looming. Neighbouring tribes and cultures envied Rome for its favourable position on the Tiber, from which it controlled the salt trade in Central Italy. Rome itself also sought to expand its influence and fought and conquered other peoples from her earliest days. In these days, Rome was ruled by kings and we traditionally count seven of them. After the last king, Tarquinius Superbus, was ousted, a Republic was founded. The Roman Republic needed a good army. This army was not composed of mercenaries, nor originally of professional soldiers. It was made up of ordinary citizens, Roman men who owned a farm and could be turned into legionaries to fight Rome’s offensive and defensive wars. The legions were – and we should never forget this – supported by soldiers provided by allied nations, who supplied roughly half of the infantry in the Roman armies and the majority of the cavalry. This essay aims to reconstruct the Republican army. A previous essay discussed the Imperial army. The early days\nBurial gifts can give us some information about the earliest Roman soldiers, the men who fought for Rome’s kings. From these gifts, Belgian archaeologist Bernard van Daele has deduced that these soldiers were heavily influenced by the Etruscan civilisation, and perhaps even by the so-called Villanovan culture, the first Iron Age culture of Italy that preceded it. Roman warriors fought with spears, javelins, swords, axes and daggers. Swords were usually of the antenna type, which means that they had long (around 70 cm), yet very narrow blades. Wooden shields, both round and oval, were used, but the early Roman soldiers appear to have worn little armour. If they did, they usually donned bronze breastplates known as the pectorale or cardiophylax (“heart-protector”). The richest citizens could also afford round or pointed helmets. Most of the material found appears to be Etruscan in origin. The names of the three Roman tribes (tribus) that are mentioned in Livius 1.13 – Ramnes, Tities and Luceres – are probably also Etruscan. The Etruscan heartland was in present-day Tuscany, which is named after them. The Estruscans had expanded their territories to the north, into the fertile Po Valley, where they clashed with Celts and Ligurians, and to the south, where they came into conflict with Italian tribes and the Greek colonists of Magna Graecia. Rome was at the most a local power at that time. It was subjugated and ruled by Etruscan kings – or perhaps rather: warlords – from the late seventh to the late sixth century. It is not clear when the hoplite style of warfare was introduced in ancient Rome, but the introduction of the hoplite and the phalanx are traditionally attributed to the military reforms of king Servius Tullius (578-534 BCE), who is often equated with the Etruscan warlord Mastarna. Of the five classes of Roman citizens he is said to have created, only the first class, the wealthiest citizens, fought as hoplites. They were completely equipped in the Greek style, with a long thrusting spear, a sword, a bronze or linen cuirass, bronze greaves, a helmet and a large, round shield known as the clipeus. The hoplites were supported by centuries of lightly armoured spearmen, light infantry, skirmishers and slingers. These were recruited from the classes II to V, while the Roman elite provided the cavalry (equites). Most of the military equipment used was Greek in origin, although there have been finds of swords from this period which are Italo-Etruscan in design. Some helmets found are also thought to be more Etruscan than Greek.\n\nOf course, the Romans could have countered the Parthian tactics had they brought with them a sizable force of foot archers, and on this point the the blame can be laid on the lack of foresight and incompetence of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the Roman commander at Carrhae. It is interesting to note that, unlike in other circumstances where the Romans adapted their infantry tactics to face a wide array of threats, the Romans ultimately found it necessary to induct the cataphract heavy cavalry into their own armies. This process began in the 3rd century C.E., and by the 6th century C.E. the army of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire essentially mirrored that of their Sassanid Persian rivals in their deployment of cataphracts. It struck me that the best way to visualize pre-modern conflict, is actually by looking at street fights. Forget about cheesy \"historical\" war movies; the vast majority of them do not depict conflict in a realistic way, and focus on entertainment value far more than historical accuracy. If you want to learn how the Romans (or any ancient\/medieval army based on heavy infantry) would have fought, look at this video of a battle between protesters and police in Ukraine. Pay especially close attention from about 3:10 onward:\nGranted, a Roman army would not be as passive as the Ukrainian cops are here. But I still think this gives a good idea of how a disciplined Roman army (the cops) would have dealt with a horde of barbarians (the protesters). The defensive tactic used by the cops in the latter part of the video is practically identical with the Roman testudo. ^^ That actually reminded me of the movie 300! If someone wants to get a feel of medival and ancient warfare, I suggest them playing the total war series. I have played only one game, but it gave me really some knowledge about battles were done during that time. You will find that a lot of @civfanatic said is actually useful when mongols invade Europe :thumb: That I think is a good proof that the game really tries to simulate real battles. romans were trained warriors with years of wrestling experience,also had there own medicine and treatment systems. Compare this with Genghis Khan & his marauding hordes! ( incidentally the broad concept of American FM 105 regarding the Air-land battle concept has been taken from the Mongols) acronym is AIDS, Agility, Initiative, Depth & Synchronization. His army occupied one fifth of the land mass of the globe. phew! Strength vs Weakness - You want to pit your strength against your opponent's weakness in combat. Mobility - Being able to out maneuver your opponent allows you to control most other aspects of a battle. Advance & Retreat - There is no humiliation in retreat. Mongols frequently used retreat to create advantage in combat through ambushes and spreading out the opponent's forces. Discipline - Mongol soldiers were heavily trained in the planned tactics that they could work through a battle without the need to shout orders. Nor did they break ranks except when it was orchestrated. Unlike a temporary feudal service of European armies, Mongol soldiers used their hunting and herding skills in combat and thus were in training year round. Opponent's Morale - Mongols inflated stories of their battlefield prowess to intimidate their opponents, and used other propaganda and pyrotechnics to break the opponent's morale before and during the battle. Even the present meaning of the word Horde in European languages to be a large overwhelming mass of people, rather than a small campsite as it means in Mongol, is a continued result of such propaganda. Objective - Never lose sight of the overall object, even in the heat of battle. A charge may smash the unit in front of you while abandoning an important strategic position thus losing the war. Survival - Here is where Mongols differed most drastically from other cultures such as Europe or Japan. Mongols placed high emphasis on surviving at all costs. There was no glorious defeat. There were no suicide troops, no unit was sent on a mission they would not be expected to survive. The only glory was in winning.\n\nThe chapter concludes with a brief but interesting review of recruitment, training and promotion--with an almost exclusively imperial focus. The fourth chapter, \"The Culture of the Roman Army,\" continues the handbook style\/format. Following a brief section on \"physiognomy,\" by which Southern seems to mean the provenance of the recruits, we read of matters of morale, discipline, and traditions. Southern notes the privileged legal status of soldiers but notes as well that military discipline was apparently enforced with less rigor in the Empire than in the Republic and also less so in peacetime than in war. Punishments ranged from extra duty to loss of rank or pay to discharge and finally execution. Southern notes as well that soldiers were not entitled to leave or furlough but could apparently arrange privately with their commanders to be absent (literally at their own expense) from camp and the duty roster. The section on traditions explores unit names, decorations and medals, uniforms (from helmets to socks over several pages), military music, and holidays. The last include the specially \"military festivals\" of the Quinquatria on 19 March and the feast of Vesta on 9 June as well as the emperor's birthday and 21 April, the anniversary of the founding of the city. A section on veterans concludes the chapter; Southern explains the military diploma, the privileges and obligations, the state funded, one time, cash pensions of the retirees, and finally the exemptions from some taxes. Chapter five examines the subject of \"The Roman Army at War.\" Southern opens with the traditional claim that \"From their earliest beginnings to the late empire, the Romans consistently adopted a warlike disposition\"(171). That said, however, she believes that the Empire lacked a strategic plan: Romans tended to behave reactively in going to war and pragmatically in settling a conflict. Reflecting the defensive posture employed over much of imperial history, Southern devotes several pages (178-186) to frontiers and forts (with perhaps the book's most useful illustrations--diagrams of the Wallsend and Housestead forts on Hadrian's Wall). Under tactics and operational concepts are grouped the order of march (with examples taken from Polybius, Josephus and Arrian), marching and temporary camps, and battle. The chapter examines as well planning and staff work, command and control (including the difficult balance of aggression and diffidence that troubled imperial commanders like Corbulo and Agricola), and operations involving combined naval and ground forces. Rather unusually for this book but doubtlessly reflecting the sources, almost all of the information about the last dates from the Republic rather than the Empire. \"The Tools of War\" occupy chapter six, though in addition to weaponry Southern examines logistics, communications, medicine, technology and cartography. The weapons discussed include gladius, pilum, lancea, spatha, pugio, bows and arrows, artillery, and slingshots. Here more than anywhere else a selection of drawings or photographs would have been immensely helpful. While Southern does provide references to other authors, I would have traded several of the book's illustrations taken from the Library of Congress for genuine \"hardware\" here. In discussing logistics Southern points to the obvious differences between Republic and Empire when permanent forts and bases were the rule. Over several pages Southern discusses food and fodder requirements, the number of pack animals employed by a legion on the move, and the speed of transport\/march. Of intelligence and communications Southern suggests that they worked much better on the local than the regional or imperial level; and so, as the frontiers became increasingly troublesome, emperors necessarily moved from Rome to where their presence was required. The discussion of medicine is brief, though Southern does demonstrate that the Romans made significant advances in the treatment of wounds and outbreaks of disease\/illness in camp. Equally brief are the sections on technology and cartography, the former effectively equated with engineering and the latter with itineraries; again references indicate possibilities for more detailed study. Chapter seven, \"The Late Roman Army,\" returns to more traditional, historical narrative in the book's shortest chapter; here Southern provides a dramatically abridged but updated version of her 1996 work of the same title. The central issues are the adjustments, reforms, and innovations occasioned by \". .\n\nThe importance of ancient roman society\nAncient greek art emphasized the importance and of all things greek and roman browse around this page for anything about art and architecture.

The colosseum a roman architecture history essay was one of the most important architectural works of ancient rome and standards of ancient roman society.\n\nRoman engineering constituted a large portion of Rome's technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of roads, bridges, aqueducts, baths, theaters and arenas. Many monuments, such as the Colosseum, Pont du Gard, and Pantheon, still remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture. The Romans were particularly renowned for their architecture, which is grouped with Greek traditions into \"Classical architecture\". However, for the course of the Roman Republic, Roman architecture remained stylistically almost identical to Greek architecture. Although there were many differences between Roman and Greek building types, Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new orders of columns, composite and Tuscan, and from the dome, which was derived from the Etruscan arch, Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Roman Republic. It was at this time, in the 1st century BC, that Romans started to widely use concrete (which was invented in the late 3rd century BC), a powerful cement derived from pozzolana which soon supplanted marble as the chief Roman building material and allowed for numerous daring architectural schemata. Also in the 1st century BC, Vitruvius wrote De architectura, possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history. In the late 1st century BC, Rome also began to make use of glassblowing soon after its invention in Syria, which occurred about 50 BC, and mosaics took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during Sulla's campaigns in Greece. Article on history of Roman concrete\nConcrete made possible the paved, durable Roman roads, many of which were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Roman Empire dramatically increased Rome's power and influence. Originally constructed for military purposes, to allow Roman legions to be rapidly deployed, these highways had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome's role as a trading crossroads-the origin of the phrase \"all roads lead to Rome\". The Roman government maintained way stations which provided refreshments to travelers at regular intervals along the roads, constructed bridges where necessary, and established a system of horse relays for couriers that allowed a dispatch to travel up to 800 km (500 miles) in 24 hours. The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to assist in their agriculture. The city of Rome itself was supplied by eleven aqueducts with a combined length of 350 km (260 miles). Most aqueducts were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches. Powered entirely by gravity, the aqueducts transported very large amounts of water with an efficiency that remained unsurpassed for two thousand years. Sometimes, where depressions deeper than 50 miles had to be crossed, inverted siphons were used to force water uphill. The Romans also made major advancements in sanitation. Romans were particularly famous for their public baths, called thermae, which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses came to have flush toilets and indoor plumbing, and a complex sewer system, the Cloaca Maxima, was used to drain the local marshes and carry waste into the Tiber river. Some historians have speculated that the use of Lead pipes in sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread lead poisoning which contributed to the decline in birth rate and general decay of Roman society leading up to the fall of Rome. However, lead content would have been minimized because the flow of water from aqueducts could not be shut off; it ran continuously through public and private outlets into the drains, and only a small number of taps were in use. Military power of the Roman Empire. The early Roman army was, like those of other contemporary city-states, a citizen force in which the bulk of the troops fought as a legion. Each legion contained some 5,000 soldiers called legionaries and was divided into groups of 60 to 120 soldiers. The legion had several advantages over the phalanx. It was smaller and could move faster. Soldiers in a phalanx fought as a group and could only move in one direction.\n\nIn fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).\n\nLe Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.\n\nFor a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.\n\nAllason-Jones (2002) has commented on the certainty of local clothes supply at Vindolanda, the quality of which has been described as ‘excellent’ (Wild 2002: 32), and a number of spindle-whorls have been recovered from vici.7 While Wild (2002) favoured requisition as the supply-mechanism, the reference to clothing in the Vindolanda tablets, the level of workmanship, and the continuing importance of the British textile industry into the later empire (receiving prominent mentions in Diocletian’s price edict) point to a specialised industry. Given that soldiers in the Principate nominally purchased their own equipment (Speidel 1992: 131–136), it is not surprising that there should be significant scope for private manufacturers in extramural settlements to establish themselves. It may well be that much textile work, especially repair and maintenance work, was done by soldiers’ families living in extramural settlements. Family ‘back home’ could also certainly have contributed: as noted in the Vindolanda letter recording that socks, sandals, and underpants have been sent to a soldier (Tab. 346). That said, the connection is largely suppositional and does not in any case dent the impression of a specialised industry in operation. Turning to staples, traditional explanations for the grain supply of the Roman army have been found in compulsory methods such as taxation and forced purchase, supported in the British case by Tacitus’ famous passage where Britons are forced to sell grain to the state (Agricola, 19). Subsequently, more complex models of frontier supply have been advanced by scholars. Whittaker (2004) emphasised a mix of tax-in-kind and wholesale purchase of grain, initially involving staple shipment from the continent, and later importation from the south of Britain to the frontier zone. Similarly, Gerrard (2008: 123) explains the ‘irrational’ distribution of Black-Burnished 1 (BB1) ware through a mix of voluntary and involuntary supply mechanisms. Kolb (2002) discusses the Roman state’s use of private enterprise for official supply and transport. However, although they are important in beginning to suggest the complex role that civilians played in military supply, these arguments tend to underestimate the importance of local production sources. Archaeologists have long emphasised the likelihood that northern forts had a local supply of grain (e.g. Higham 1982), supported by pollen studies which have questioned the strict lowland\/highland, cultivated\/pastoral dichotomies which underpinned traditional theories (Van der Veen 1992: 159). Characterisations of the frontier as difficult highland underestimate the complexity of the landscape; there are in fact ‘lowlands’ and fertile valleys in the frontier zone, and the barrenness of upland areas should not be exaggerated. On the other hand, suggestions of local production sometimes lead back to arguments emphasising tax-in-kind, leaving little room for civilian actors; some archaeologists have endorsed the idea of military-controlled land for grain production (e.g. Higham 1991; Huntley 2013). Against this, and working from the Vindolanda corpus, Evers (2011: 25–26, 42–49) posited a nuanced sketch of a complex logistical system, incorporating multiple modes of supply, including local production, staple importation, forced purchase\/taxation, and voluntary supply methods. Indeed, a close reading of Octavius’ letter from Vindolanda (Tab. 343) supports and advances Evers’ reading, and demonstrates that, even early in the province’s development, civilians were closely involved in wholesale supply. The letter, found inside a probable centurion’s-quarters of the early second century AD fort at Vindolanda, concerns the provision of several supplies. Most significant is the fact that Octavius has acquired 5,000 modii of grain, for which he now needs 500 denarii from Candidus, the recipient. There is no question that this must refer to the regular supplies of the unit, and not ‘ancillary’ supplies as Whittaker (2004: 106) suggests; this amount would feed 1,000 men for a month, or the 296 soldiers listed as present in Tab. 154 for over 100 days (based on consumption of a 1\/6 modius per-day, per-soldier), as Evers (2011: 48) recognised.","passages":[{"passage":"In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.

The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>"]},{"passage":"Rome began as a collection of villages on several hills near the river Tiber. Life there was neither comfortable, nor safe. War was always looming. Neighbouring tribes and cultures envied Rome for its favourable position on the Tiber, from which it controlled the salt trade in Central Italy. Rome itself also sought to expand its influence and fought and conquered other peoples from her earliest days. In these days, Rome was ruled by kings and we traditionally count seven of them. After the last king, Tarquinius Superbus, was ousted, a Republic was founded. The Roman Republic needed a good army. This army was not composed of mercenaries, nor originally of professional soldiers. It was made up of ordinary citizens, Roman men who owned a farm and could be turned into legionaries to fight Rome’s offensive and defensive wars. The legions were – and we should never forget this – supported by soldiers provided by allied nations, who supplied roughly half of the infantry in the Roman armies and the majority of the cavalry. This essay aims to reconstruct the Republican army. A previous essay discussed the Imperial army. The early days\nBurial gifts can give us some information about the earliest Roman soldiers, the men who fought for Rome’s kings. From these gifts, Belgian archaeologist Bernard van Daele has deduced that these soldiers were heavily influenced by the Etruscan civilisation, and perhaps even by the so-called Villanovan culture, the first Iron Age culture of Italy that preceded it. Roman warriors fought with spears, javelins, swords, axes and daggers. Swords were usually of the antenna type, which means that they had long (around 70 cm), yet very narrow blades. Wooden shields, both round and oval, were used, but the early Roman soldiers appear to have worn little armour. If they did, they usually donned bronze breastplates known as the pectorale or cardiophylax (“heart-protector”). The richest citizens could also afford round or pointed helmets. Most of the material found appears to be Etruscan in origin. The names of the three Roman tribes (tribus) that are mentioned in Livius 1.13 – Ramnes, Tities and Luceres – are probably also Etruscan. The Etruscan heartland was in present-day Tuscany, which is named after them. The Estruscans had expanded their territories to the north, into the fertile Po Valley, where they clashed with Celts and Ligurians, and to the south, where they came into conflict with Italian tribes and the Greek colonists of Magna Graecia. Rome was at the most a local power at that time. It was subjugated and ruled by Etruscan kings – or perhaps rather: warlords – from the late seventh to the late sixth century. It is not clear when the hoplite style of warfare was introduced in ancient Rome, but the introduction of the hoplite and the phalanx are traditionally attributed to the military reforms of king Servius Tullius (578-534 BCE), who is often equated with the Etruscan warlord Mastarna. Of the five classes of Roman citizens he is said to have created, only the first class, the wealthiest citizens, fought as hoplites. They were completely equipped in the Greek style, with a long thrusting spear, a sword, a bronze or linen cuirass, bronze greaves, a helmet and a large, round shield known as the clipeus. The hoplites were supported by centuries of lightly armoured spearmen, light infantry, skirmishers and slingers. These were recruited from the classes II to V, while the Roman elite provided the cavalry (equites). Most of the military equipment used was Greek in origin, although there have been finds of swords from this period which are Italo-Etruscan in design. Some helmets found are also thought to be more Etruscan than Greek.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:950eb11a-29cb-4063-acd2-44a381425c9d>"]},{"passage":"Of course, the Romans could have countered the Parthian tactics had they brought with them a sizable force of foot archers, and on this point the the blame can be laid on the lack of foresight and incompetence of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the Roman commander at Carrhae. It is interesting to note that, unlike in other circumstances where the Romans adapted their infantry tactics to face a wide array of threats, the Romans ultimately found it necessary to induct the cataphract heavy cavalry into their own armies. This process began in the 3rd century C.E., and by the 6th century C.E. the army of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire essentially mirrored that of their Sassanid Persian rivals in their deployment of cataphracts. It struck me that the best way to visualize pre-modern conflict, is actually by looking at street fights. Forget about cheesy \"historical\" war movies; the vast majority of them do not depict conflict in a realistic way, and focus on entertainment value far more than historical accuracy. If you want to learn how the Romans (or any ancient\/medieval army based on heavy infantry) would have fought, look at this video of a battle between protesters and police in Ukraine. Pay especially close attention from about 3:10 onward:\nGranted, a Roman army would not be as passive as the Ukrainian cops are here. But I still think this gives a good idea of how a disciplined Roman army (the cops) would have dealt with a horde of barbarians (the protesters). The defensive tactic used by the cops in the latter part of the video is practically identical with the Roman testudo. ^^ That actually reminded me of the movie 300! If someone wants to get a feel of medival and ancient warfare, I suggest them playing the total war series. I have played only one game, but it gave me really some knowledge about battles were done during that time.

His army occupied one fifth of the land mass of the globe. phew! Strength vs Weakness - You want to pit your strength against your opponent's weakness in combat. Mobility - Being able to out maneuver your opponent allows you to control most other aspects of a battle. Advance & Retreat - There is no humiliation in retreat. Mongols frequently used retreat to create advantage in combat through ambushes and spreading out the opponent's forces. Discipline - Mongol soldiers were heavily trained in the planned tactics that they could work through a battle without the need to shout orders. Nor did they break ranks except when it was orchestrated. Unlike a temporary feudal service of European armies, Mongol soldiers used their hunting and herding skills in combat and thus were in training year round. Opponent's Morale - Mongols inflated stories of their battlefield prowess to intimidate their opponents, and used other propaganda and pyrotechnics to break the opponent's morale before and during the battle. Even the present meaning of the word Horde in European languages to be a large overwhelming mass of people, rather than a small campsite as it means in Mongol, is a continued result of such propaganda. Objective - Never lose sight of the overall object, even in the heat of battle. A charge may smash the unit in front of you while abandoning an important strategic position thus losing the war. Survival - Here is where Mongols differed most drastically from other cultures such as Europe or Japan. Mongols placed high emphasis on surviving at all costs. There was no glorious defeat. There were no suicide troops, no unit was sent on a mission they would not be expected to survive. The only glory was in winning.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c3cb8837-6107-4307-84a4-241dad48c47a>"]},{"passage":"The chapter concludes with a brief but interesting review of recruitment, training and promotion--with an almost exclusively imperial focus. The fourth chapter, \"The Culture of the Roman Army,\" continues the handbook style\/format. Following a brief section on \"physiognomy,\" by which Southern seems to mean the provenance of the recruits, we read of matters of morale, discipline, and traditions. Southern notes the privileged legal status of soldiers but notes as well that military discipline was apparently enforced with less rigor in the Empire than in the Republic and also less so in peacetime than in war. Punishments ranged from extra duty to loss of rank or pay to discharge and finally execution. Southern notes as well that soldiers were not entitled to leave or furlough but could apparently arrange privately with their commanders to be absent (literally at their own expense) from camp and the duty roster. The section on traditions explores unit names, decorations and medals, uniforms (from helmets to socks over several pages), military music, and holidays. The last include the specially \"military festivals\" of the Quinquatria on 19 March and the feast of Vesta on 9 June as well as the emperor's birthday and 21 April, the anniversary of the founding of the city. A section on veterans concludes the chapter; Southern explains the military diploma, the privileges and obligations, the state funded, one time, cash pensions of the retirees, and finally the exemptions from some taxes. Chapter five examines the subject of \"The Roman Army at War.\" Southern opens with the traditional claim that \"From their earliest beginnings to the late empire, the Romans consistently adopted a warlike disposition\"(171). That said, however, she believes that the Empire lacked a strategic plan: Romans tended to behave reactively in going to war and pragmatically in settling a conflict. Reflecting the defensive posture employed over much of imperial history, Southern devotes several pages (178-186) to frontiers and forts (with perhaps the book's most useful illustrations--diagrams of the Wallsend and Housestead forts on Hadrian's Wall). Under tactics and operational concepts are grouped the order of march (with examples taken from Polybius, Josephus and Arrian), marching and temporary camps, and battle. The chapter examines as well planning and staff work, command and control (including the difficult balance of aggression and diffidence that troubled imperial commanders like Corbulo and Agricola), and operations involving combined naval and ground forces. Rather unusually for this book but doubtlessly reflecting the sources, almost all of the information about the last dates from the Republic rather than the Empire. \"The Tools of War\" occupy chapter six, though in addition to weaponry Southern examines logistics, communications, medicine, technology and cartography. The weapons discussed include gladius, pilum, lancea, spatha, pugio, bows and arrows, artillery, and slingshots. Here more than anywhere else a selection of drawings or photographs would have been immensely helpful. While Southern does provide references to other authors, I would have traded several of the book's illustrations taken from the Library of Congress for genuine \"hardware\" here. In discussing logistics Southern points to the obvious differences between Republic and Empire when permanent forts and bases were the rule. Over several pages Southern discusses food and fodder requirements, the number of pack animals employed by a legion on the move, and the speed of transport\/march. Of intelligence and communications Southern suggests that they worked much better on the local than the regional or imperial level; and so, as the frontiers became increasingly troublesome, emperors necessarily moved from Rome to where their presence was required. The discussion of medicine is brief, though Southern does demonstrate that the Romans made significant advances in the treatment of wounds and outbreaks of disease\/illness in camp. Equally brief are the sections on technology and cartography, the former effectively equated with engineering and the latter with itineraries; again references indicate possibilities for more detailed study. Chapter seven, \"The Late Roman Army,\" returns to more traditional, historical narrative in the book's shortest chapter; here Southern provides a dramatically abridged but updated version of her 1996 work of the same title.

Many monuments, such as the Colosseum, Pont du Gard, and Pantheon, still remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture. The Romans were particularly renowned for their architecture, which is grouped with Greek traditions into \"Classical architecture\". However, for the course of the Roman Republic, Roman architecture remained stylistically almost identical to Greek architecture. Although there were many differences between Roman and Greek building types, Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new orders of columns, composite and Tuscan, and from the dome, which was derived from the Etruscan arch, Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Roman Republic. It was at this time, in the 1st century BC, that Romans started to widely use concrete (which was invented in the late 3rd century BC), a powerful cement derived from pozzolana which soon supplanted marble as the chief Roman building material and allowed for numerous daring architectural schemata. Also in the 1st century BC, Vitruvius wrote De architectura, possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history. In the late 1st century BC, Rome also began to make use of glassblowing soon after its invention in Syria, which occurred about 50 BC, and mosaics took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during Sulla's campaigns in Greece. Article on history of Roman concrete\nConcrete made possible the paved, durable Roman roads, many of which were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Roman Empire dramatically increased Rome's power and influence. Originally constructed for military purposes, to allow Roman legions to be rapidly deployed, these highways had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome's role as a trading crossroads-the origin of the phrase \"all roads lead to Rome\". The Roman government maintained way stations which provided refreshments to travelers at regular intervals along the roads, constructed bridges where necessary, and established a system of horse relays for couriers that allowed a dispatch to travel up to 800 km (500 miles) in 24 hours. The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to assist in their agriculture. The city of Rome itself was supplied by eleven aqueducts with a combined length of 350 km (260 miles). Most aqueducts were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches. Powered entirely by gravity, the aqueducts transported very large amounts of water with an efficiency that remained unsurpassed for two thousand years. Sometimes, where depressions deeper than 50 miles had to be crossed, inverted siphons were used to force water uphill. The Romans also made major advancements in sanitation. Romans were particularly famous for their public baths, called thermae, which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses came to have flush toilets and indoor plumbing, and a complex sewer system, the Cloaca Maxima, was used to drain the local marshes and carry waste into the Tiber river. Some historians have speculated that the use of Lead pipes in sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread lead poisoning which contributed to the decline in birth rate and general decay of Roman society leading up to the fall of Rome. However, lead content would have been minimized because the flow of water from aqueducts could not be shut off; it ran continuously through public and private outlets into the drains, and only a small number of taps were in use. Military power of the Roman Empire. The early Roman army was, like those of other contemporary city-states, a citizen force in which the bulk of the troops fought as a legion. Each legion contained some 5,000 soldiers called legionaries and was divided into groups of 60 to 120 soldiers. The legion had several advantages over the phalanx. It was smaller and could move faster. Soldiers in a phalanx fought as a group and could only move in one direction.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8b224215-202e-43ea-8bb8-65a20366b176>"]},{"passage":"In fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7b1790ca-1d0b-4b0a-8676-7afcb6d5e50b>"]},{"passage":"Le Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:32818d17-4e19-4047-b97f-5ade37102a85>"]},{"passage":"For a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0d9aba3b-5482-4596-bd57-7d9e50cbe67b>"]},{"passage":"Allason-Jones (2002) has commented on the certainty of local clothes supply at Vindolanda, the quality of which has been described as ‘excellent’ (Wild 2002: 32), and a number of spindle-whorls have been recovered from vici.7 While Wild (2002) favoured requisition as the supply-mechanism, the reference to clothing in the Vindolanda tablets, the level of workmanship, and the continuing importance of the British textile industry into the later empire (receiving prominent mentions in Diocletian’s price edict) point to a specialised industry. Given that soldiers in the Principate nominally purchased their own equipment (Speidel 1992: 131–136), it is not surprising that there should be significant scope for private manufacturers in extramural settlements to establish themselves. It may well be that much textile work, especially repair and maintenance work, was done by soldiers’ families living in extramural settlements. Family ‘back home’ could also certainly have contributed: as noted in the Vindolanda letter recording that socks, sandals, and underpants have been sent to a soldier (Tab. 346). That said, the connection is largely suppositional and does not in any case dent the impression of a specialised industry in operation. Turning to staples, traditional explanations for the grain supply of the Roman army have been found in compulsory methods such as taxation and forced purchase, supported in the British case by Tacitus’ famous passage where Britons are forced to sell grain to the state (Agricola, 19). Subsequently, more complex models of frontier supply have been advanced by scholars. Whittaker (2004) emphasised a mix of tax-in-kind and wholesale purchase of grain, initially involving staple shipment from the continent, and later importation from the south of Britain to the frontier zone. Similarly, Gerrard (2008: 123) explains the ‘irrational’ distribution of Black-Burnished 1 (BB1) ware through a mix of voluntary and involuntary supply mechanisms. Kolb (2002) discusses the Roman state’s use of private enterprise for official supply and transport. However, although they are important in beginning to suggest the complex role that civilians played in military supply, these arguments tend to underestimate the importance of local production sources. Archaeologists have long emphasised the likelihood that northern forts had a local supply of grain (e.g. Higham 1982), supported by pollen studies which have questioned the strict lowland\/highland, cultivated\/pastoral dichotomies which underpinned traditional theories (Van der Veen 1992: 159). Characterisations of the frontier as difficult highland underestimate the complexity of the landscape; there are in fact ‘lowlands’ and fertile valleys in the frontier zone, and the barrenness of upland areas should not be exaggerated. On the other hand, suggestions of local production sometimes lead back to arguments emphasising tax-in-kind, leaving little room for civilian actors; some archaeologists have endorsed the idea of military-controlled land for grain production (e.g. Higham 1991; Huntley 2013). Against this, and working from the Vindolanda corpus, Evers (2011: 25–26, 42–49) posited a nuanced sketch of a complex logistical system, incorporating multiple modes of supply, including local production, staple importation, forced purchase\/taxation, and voluntary supply methods. Indeed, a close reading of Octavius’ letter from Vindolanda (Tab. 343) supports and advances Evers’ reading, and demonstrates that, even early in the province’s development, civilians were closely involved in wholesale supply. The letter, found inside a probable centurion’s-quarters of the early second century AD fort at Vindolanda, concerns the provision of several supplies. Most significant is the fact that Octavius has acquired 5,000 modii of grain, for which he now needs 500 denarii from Candidus, the recipient. There is no question that this must refer to the regular supplies of the unit, and not ‘ancillary’ supplies as Whittaker (2004: 106) suggests; this amount would feed 1,000 men for a month, or the 296 soldiers listed as present in Tab. 154 for over 100 days (based on consumption of a 1\/6 modius per-day, per-soldier), as Evers (2011: 48) recognised.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:18612846-6173-450d-92cd-353d5701b857>"]}]}

Though it is a personal choice of taste you should know at least the basics of pairing foods with wine. Always remember that there is no rule of pairing food with wine but if you follow some basic guidelines then you can get the best taste from both the food and wine. Understand the Taste of Food and Wine:\nBefore pairing food and wine you must understand the taste of both. This is very important for understanding the nature of food and wine. Without determining the tastes you can not pair foods with wine. First, taste the wine and try to understand its smell, sweetness, taste and acidity. Mark it as soft or hard. Then try similar foods. Consider the charastics like texture, sweetness, acidity, taste etc. If it tastes good after wine then you’ve found the right pair. Repeat this process to match similar foods with wine. Pair Wine According to Food Taste:\nThere are four types of basic tastes of foods – saltiness, sweetness, bitterness and acidity. It is very easy to understand the saltiness of a food. If your food is salty then choose sweet wine, otherwise the taste of wine will be spoiled. Remember that salt + sweet = good pair. Sweetness is an easy to understand taste but it differs according to age. Sweet food does not go well with sweet wine. Try to match sweet wine with foods that do not taste sweet. Bitterness is a magic taste and it reduces acidity of wine and makes it sweeter. So, pair fresh red wine with bitter foods like olives, wild herbs etc. You should not serve wine with acidic foods like vinegars. You can pair sweet wines with little acidic foods. Pair Wine According to Food Type:\nI already have mentioned that pairing wine and food does not have any rule, it is just a guideline. Wine can be paired according to food types also. Red wine goes well with beef or lamb but if you serve chicken, fish or seafood then pair white wine with it. If your food is spicy then pair it with sweet wine as the sweetness of wine reduces the spiciness and balance it. There are three types of cheese – soft, hard and blue. Pair hard wine with soft cheese, light wine with hard cheese and sweet wine with blue cheese. Though wine does not go well with desserts you can still pair desserts with sweet wines if the desserts itself is not too sweety. Arrange the Meal:\nYou can arrange the meal from two ways – select the foods and pair wine with them or select the wine and pair foods with it. If you follow the basic guidelines of food-wine pairing then your dinner will be very successful. Do not follow any rule when pairing food and wine, you should account personal preferences. The author is a specialist on wine and loves to taste different types of wine from around the world. He is a blogger on 'Wine Cooler Reviews' and reviews wine coolers from various brands.\n\nPairing Food and Wine\nThrow out the old rules-of-thumb\nThere are a whole bunch of rules-of thumb that have developed over the years\n- Serve white wine with fish or white meat and red wine with red meat\n- Serve red wine at room temperature (whatever that might be)\n- You only decant red wine\n- Serve white wine cold\nAll of which only have the tiniest speck of truth, if any at all. Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world \/ old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.\n\nAnd the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.\n\nUndoubtedly, it can be confusing when it comes to choosing the perfect wine with different food, especially if you are new in the field. That is why we have compiled some fundamentals tips and advice to help you pair your wine and food in the correct way below. Here’s What You Need to Know for Great Wine and Food Pairings\nThere Need to Have More Acidic than the Meal\nYou need to choose a wine having a very sour or sharp taste; in other words, the amount of acidic should be higher than your food. In this way, you will enjoy the wine much better. The Food Should Be Less Sweeter than the Wine\nUndoubtedly, the food you are having need to contain less sugar than the wine you are drinking. Else, you will not genuinely have the authentic taste of the wine. Drink Low-Alcohol Wine with Spicy Foods\nIt is advisable to drink wine with a low amount of alcohol with spicy food since this can cause stomach burn and deprive you of the wine’s actual taste due to the burning sensation in the mouth. Red Meat is Best to Drink Red Wine With\nIf you have red meat for a meal, consider having a glass of red wine to make the meal more delicious. Red meat with red wine has always been the best combination that could exist. Choose Lighter Wine for Dessert\nWhen having dessert, it is advisable to choose lighter consistency of wine. This will allow you to enjoy your dessert to its authentic taste, especially if it contains sugar. Cheese and Rosé Wine is an Excellent Combination\nHave you ever tried Rosé wine with cheese? If not, you are imperatively missing something excellent. Consider tasting both, and see how delicious the meal will be.\n\nThe Basics of Pairing Food and Wine\nMatching wine with different cuisines and flavour profiles can be confusing, but to help you get it right, the Wine Selectors Tasting Panel has taken the guesswork out of the equation with their handy guide to creating complementary food and wine pairings. Balance & harmony\nWine and food should be partners, with neither dominating the other. Richer foods need a richer wine that won’t fade in comparison, while light foods need a delicate wine, so the flavours in the dish aren’t overwhelmed. You can create a good match by echoing the ingredients in your food with the characteristics in the wine, for example, asparagus with Sauvignon Blanc, a spicy Shiraz with fragrant Asian dishes, or an earthy Pinot enjoyed with anything containing mushrooms. Don’t forget that the dominant feature of a dish can sometimes be the sauce rather than the main ingredient, so use that as your guide. Some wines can suffer in the presence of chilli, but others are ideal. Lower alcohol whites like Riesling and Semillon work really well, as they have high acidity and pair well with fried dishes, and with ingredients high in salt like soy sauce. A spicy red like Shiraz is arguably the best red all-rounder with spicy Asian food – just avoid wines that are too high in alcohol or tannins, as they will accentuate any heat present. Slightly off-dry Rieslings can have a calming effect on spicy food and don’t forget the option of starting the meal with a cold beer. Tannins love fat\nTannins are the astringent structural components in wine and when the tannins are obvious, a meal with a high fat content will soften the mouth-feel and create overall harmony. Great examples are slow roasted lamb shoulder or Parmigiano Reggiano with Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wines. Fire up the barbeque and enjoy a robust Malbec with a fatty prime rib or juicy pork sausage. Acid loves acid, salt & fat\nHigh acid wines harmonise well with the natural acidity in food, with a crisp white paired with a salad featuring a zingy vinaigrette being a good example. Acid also balances fat, so beer-battered fish & chips are best served with a zesty white like Pinot Grigio, Riesling or a Classic White Blend. White wine with white meat & red wine with red meat? There is no right or wrong, but certain varieties do have a natural affinity – think chicken and Chardonnay, or pork and Pinot, however, accompanying sauces & the cooking method may influence your ultimate choice. Add a bunch of Italian herbs and white wine to your chicken dish and you should lean towards a Pinot Grigio, or whip up a slow cooked pork ragu with tomato and olives and a Barbera would be a better choice. Balance remains the key consideration, and neither the wine nor the dish should overpower the other. And don’t forget that gutsier whites like Chardonnay, Roussanne and Viognier can have more than enough weight to pair with a dish normally associated with a red wine match. Don’t forget the fifth taste – Umami\nDiscovered in Japan, and responsible for a heightened sense of deliciousness, umami drives the flavour X-factor in foods as diverse as mushrooms, tomatoes, anchovies, hard cheese, red meat, tomato sauce and Vegemite! Chefs and home cooks are increasing the use of foods rich in umami, which makes wine matching with these foods even more exciting. Start with a match that is well proven, like duck and Pinot, then add a mushroom component to ramp up the flavour complexity. What about desserts? The main consideration with a sweet pairing is that the wine is as sweet or sweeter than the dessert, as a dessert that’s sweeter that the wine will make the wine taste dull and knock out its character. Wines with a bit of fizz like Moscato or sweeter-style Prosecco can also be wonderful with fruit-based desserts or even the classic combination of melon and prosciutto enjoyed as part of an antipasto spread. For more information about specific wine and food pairings, check out Food and Wine Matching 101\n\nHow to Pair Wine and Food\nFocus on structure, weight, and flavor profile. You want both the food and wine to stand up nicely and not overpower one another. We recommend that you look at the dish as a whole, not just the main component or protein of the dish. At the winery, we pay close attention to the sauces, spices, and smaller items that are part of the entire plate. The end goal is to make everything sing and dance together in harmony. Below are a few tips on where to begin your epicurean journey. 3 Styles of Pairings\nComplimentary – multiple components of a dish have similar flavors to the wine. However, you still want some qualities that are different. We like to recommend that when going with the ‘complimentary’ style, acid and tannins really help liven up the pairing while accentuating the fruit without being boring. Contrast – pairing a wine with a dish that has very little or no similar components. For example, sweet and salty or spicy creamy. A wonderful pairing is Mahi Tacos with Habanero Mango Aioli paired with our Viognier. The creaminess of the wine tones down the spice of the aioli while allowing the flavors to shine. The acid cuts through the weight of the aioli keeping the dish fresh and bright. Regional – Regional matches aren’t always the perfect pairing but they do work, especially if you’re short on time. They are a great way to begin to understand more about what’s going on structurally with wine and food pairings. Ask yourself, where does this varietal originate from? A great example of a regional pairing is Paella and Tempranillo. Both originate from Spain’s Rioja region. Another classic is Barbera and Truffles. A good way to think about this is people have been making this wine and cooking this food together for hundreds of years. It WILL be good. Tips to Pair\nAcid and Fat – Nothing cuts through fat like wine with great acidity. A good glass of Sparkling or Champagne is a classic. Pairing a high acid wine with a heavy dish brings out an array of interesting flavors. Acidity in wine pairs well with fatty and sweet foods. The acidity gives the wine a ‘backbone’ to stand up to the food. Alcohol can be used to cut through fatty foods or balance a sweet dish. The high alcohol prevents the food from overpowering the wine. Fruit Characteristics – A good guide is to pair similar color fruit characteristics with a wine. For example, pair red fruits with red fruit wine qualities. Pair blue fruit with blue fruit qualities. Adding contrasting fruits often will counter balance. Bitter and Fat elevate each other and is a classic pairing. The bitterness mellows out the fat letting other qualities step forward. Bitter with bitter does not work. Fat is needed to alleviate bitterness. Fat and Creamy benefit from acid and\/or a little bit of tartness. For example, our White Wine blend with Chicken Picatta is a game changer. The wine’s acid and fruit really accentuates the flavors and seasonings of the sauce and chicken. Fatty foods need either an acidic or high alcohol wine, otherwise the fat overwhelms the wine and it tastes flabby. Salty shouldn’t compete with acidity in wine. Too much salt and acid together is not good. Spicy foods pair well with sweeter wines and more full-bodied creamy whites. An oaky, malolactic white wine and spicy Cuban dishes are excellent pairings. Sweet and Salty – Ever have chocolate covered pretzels or candied maple bacon? The salt and sweet battle each other but it ends up being a tug of war of deliciousness. A little bit of salt opens your taste bud receptors making sweet dishes (like chocolate) taste even richer or sweeter. Sweet food\/wine benefits from a little acidity. The acid helps cut through the sweet to let the flavors step forward. Very tannic wine can be balanced with a sweet food. Some tannic wines (based on flavor components) can go well with fat. Masculine, opulent, dark fruit wines with great tannic structure go phenomenally well with rich steak dishes. Wine acid and food acid need to be similar. If the wine has less acidity than the food, the wine tastes flat.\n\nPart 2: Wine -Food Pairing\nIn the previous post I discussed how wine glasses are uniquely shaped to alter the wine’s taste and aroma, therefore, changing our experience and even our enjoyment with the wine. If you haven’t read the article, you can read it here. It is definitely an informative post for those who want to learn more about wine and for those who enjoy wine. For those of you who love to entertain, this post is for you! I will discuss wine and food pairings. When wine is paired with the proper food, it adds a whole new dimension to our experience of enjoying wine. In the past, I have always thought the general rule to pairing food with wine was to match the color of the wine to that of the food. For example, I thought red wine goes with red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and white wine goes well with white meat (chicken, fish and shellfish). Simple and easy? Well, I mentioned before that there are a lot of complexity with wine. To gain harmony with your food and wine pairing, you actually want to match the acidity, sweetness and strength of flavor of the wine to the food. For a rich full bodied wine you want to pair it with rich food. Sweet wines pairs well with sweet and spicy food. And interestingly, salty food pairs well with sweet and acidic wine. If you recall, in the last post, we looked at 4 different wines made by Pacific Breeze Urban Winery in New Westminster, BC. They are the Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. I have included links to Pacific Breeze catalog for those who may be interested in purchasing their wines. The one thing that stands out for me in regards to Sauvignon Blanc is its freshness. When I took a sip of this wine, the first thing I said was “It’s so refreshing!”. It has aromas of cut grass, mingled with melon, citrus and apple. Sauvignon Blanc has high level of acidity pairing well with equally acidic food such as citrus and tomato based dishes or even salad with light vinaigrette dressing. The acidity in the wine also goes well with fried foods. For our evening, we were served lemon breaded chicken with a salad containing rocket greens, shaved fennel and orange wedges. Truly refreshing! Chardonnay is known as one of France’s great white wines. There is a difference in Chardonnay that has been oaked and unoaked. When Chardonnay has been oaked, the oak is able to impart flavors of buttery and\/or creamy caramel, vanilla, toast and spice; as well, it gives a richer color to the wine. Unoaked varieties will have a more fresh fruit flavor. Some of the fruit aroma can range from citrus and stone fruits (peaches, cherries and plums) to tropical fruits (pineapple). Oaked Chardonnay also have a richer and fuller appearance than those of unoaked Chardonnay. At Pacific Breeze we tried an oaked Chardonnay style which had a hint of butterscotch. Due to its rich and buttery flavor it was paired with Risotto with petite pois and parmesan cheese. Pinot Noir is the most food friendly of the wines because it is able to complement with the widest variety of food. The body and color of Pinot Noir is lighter than the Cabernet Sauvignon. It is light but still have complexity in its flavor. It has moderate level of tannin pairing it well with richer meats such as lamb and duck. But the tannin is also soft enough to go with white meats such as salmon and chicken. It has an earthy flavor pairing well with fruits and vegetable such as mushrooms and figs. On the nose you can smell aroma of berries with earthy tones of mushroom and leather. This wine has not yet been released by Pacific Breeze, but it is wonderful! We tested our palate with goat cheese and Prosciutto wrapped figs. The last wine on our list is the Cabernet Sauvignon, a widely recognized red wine grape variety. It is a wine that is commonly blended with other varieties of wine, such as the Merlot and the Cabernet Franc, to make the Bordeaux blends.\n\nYou may have noticed that we've begun to incorporate pairing suggestions with some of our products, beginning with our red meats, like a Bonanza Cabernet Sauvignon by Caymus with our Chuck Roast (one of Bryce's favorites). We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red\/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!\n\nWelcome to Wine by Alex, the show to watch to take your wine game to the next level! Today you’re watching the first episode of #Askwinebyalex of 2021. I’ve got a question from Alessio of @alevalente91:\n« Alex, can you remind me of the basics of food and wine pairing? »\nAlessio, that’s such a great question! I’ve done a few posts about this topic a while ago. And I was actually thinking to do a video to refresh the information. So you’re right on time! Few things to take into account for food & wine pairings\nEveryone’s perception and taste are different\nSome people are very sensitive, others don’t. The same level of sweetness or acidity can be perceived totally differently by two persons. On top of that, we all have our own personal taste. Some people like bitterness, others don’t. Every one of us is totally different. So you might enjoy your pairings, but it may not be the case of the people around you. Food is generally responsible of bad interaction, not wine\nFood and wine have a mutual influence on each other. The goal here is to have more pleasure having food and wine together, rather than separately. And also to avoid any unfortunate pairings. Now that everything is settled, let’s dive into the basics of food and wine pairing! You’ve got to understand there are 2 elements in food that will improve wine and 2 elements that will spoil it. The 2 wine-friendly elements in food: acidity and saltiness\nI’ll start with the 2 elements that will improve the wine you’re tasting: acidity and saltiness. They increase pleasant sensations in wine: sweetness, fruitiness and body. They also decrease the unpleasant sensations in wine, like astringency, bitterness and too strong acidity. Salty meals go with basically every wine and the great thing is that they’ll enhance wine aromas. So it’s all beneficial to you! Be careful to pair acid meals with wines that are even more acidic. Otherwise, they’ll just seem flat. - Think about Champagne, Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Pinot Noir,…\nThe 2 elements unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami\nNow let’s talk about the 2 elements in food that will be unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami. Not only they increase unpleasant sensations in wine: astringency, bitterness, too strong acidity, alcohol burn. But they also decrease pleasant sensations like sweetness, fruitiness and body… So as you probably guessed by now, they’re quite hard to pair with wine. But, what’s umami? It’s a taste that combines saltiness and bitterness. You’ll find it a lot in Asian food like soy sauce or miso soup, but also in asparagus, eggs, mushrooms and oysters. You need to pair sweet meals with wines that are even sweeter. This way, you’ll increase their fruitiness and balance the acidity that might be increased by the food. Meals that contain umami need to be paired with very fruity wines and, if you want a red wine, choose one that has low tannins. This way you’ll increase the fruitiness and diminish the astringent sensation of tannins. - When you have meals with umami, think about Beaujolais, unoaked Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay from Mâcon. - When you have sweet meals, go all out with a Sauternes, Barsac, Tokaji Aszu or a PX. Other consideration you can take into account\nIt can be tricky to pair spicy food with wine because the spiciness increases alcohol burn and bitterness of a wine. - Think about wines with low tannins and low alcohol. Also try to choose very fruity wines with a bit of sweetness, like Pinot Gris. Similar aromatic intensity\nI said earlier that food and wine pairings are supposed to give you more pleasure than if you were having the food, or the wine, separately. This means you also have to consider the aromatic intensity when you make your pairings! You don’t want to have one element hidden by the other one.\n\nA simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

Though it is a personal choice of taste you should know at least the basics of pairing foods with wine. Always remember that there is no rule of pairing food with wine but if you follow some basic guidelines then you can get the best taste from both the food and wine. Understand the Taste of Food and Wine:\nBefore pairing food and wine you must understand the taste of both. This is very important for understanding the nature of food and wine. Without determining the tastes you can not pair foods with wine. First, taste the wine and try to understand its smell, sweetness, taste and acidity. Mark it as soft or hard. Then try similar foods. Consider the charastics like texture, sweetness, acidity, taste etc. If it tastes good after wine then you’ve found the right pair. Repeat this process to match similar foods with wine. Pair Wine According to Food Taste:\nThere are four types of basic tastes of foods – saltiness, sweetness, bitterness and acidity. It is very easy to understand the saltiness of a food. If your food is salty then choose sweet wine, otherwise the taste of wine will be spoiled. Remember that salt + sweet = good pair. Sweetness is an easy to understand taste but it differs according to age. Sweet food does not go well with sweet wine. Try to match sweet wine with foods that do not taste sweet. Bitterness is a magic taste and it reduces acidity of wine and makes it sweeter. So, pair fresh red wine with bitter foods like olives, wild herbs etc. You should not serve wine with acidic foods like vinegars. You can pair sweet wines with little acidic foods. Pair Wine According to Food Type:\nI already have mentioned that pairing wine and food does not have any rule, it is just a guideline. Wine can be paired according to food types also. Red wine goes well with beef or lamb but if you serve chicken, fish or seafood then pair white wine with it. If your food is spicy then pair it with sweet wine as the sweetness of wine reduces the spiciness and balance it. There are three types of cheese – soft, hard and blue. Pair hard wine with soft cheese, light wine with hard cheese and sweet wine with blue cheese. Though wine does not go well with desserts you can still pair desserts with sweet wines if the desserts itself is not too sweety. Arrange the Meal:\nYou can arrange the meal from two ways – select the foods and pair wine with them or select the wine and pair foods with it. If you follow the basic guidelines of food-wine pairing then your dinner will be very successful. Do not follow any rule when pairing food and wine, you should account personal preferences.

Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world \/ old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b3db4d4b-49df-4c28-bb87-69e6c3e27e32>"]},{"passage":"And the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy.

Red Meat is Best to Drink Red Wine With\nIf you have red meat for a meal, consider having a glass of red wine to make the meal more delicious. Red meat with red wine has always been the best combination that could exist. Choose Lighter Wine for Dessert\nWhen having dessert, it is advisable to choose lighter consistency of wine. This will allow you to enjoy your dessert to its authentic taste, especially if it contains sugar. Cheese and Rosé Wine is an Excellent Combination\nHave you ever tried Rosé wine with cheese? If not, you are imperatively missing something excellent. Consider tasting both, and see how delicious the meal will be.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f46d1542-3d42-4168-94ae-ed2f5031c30b>"]},{"passage":"The Basics of Pairing Food and Wine\nMatching wine with different cuisines and flavour profiles can be confusing, but to help you get it right, the Wine Selectors Tasting Panel has taken the guesswork out of the equation with their handy guide to creating complementary food and wine pairings. Balance & harmony\nWine and food should be partners, with neither dominating the other. Richer foods need a richer wine that won’t fade in comparison, while light foods need a delicate wine, so the flavours in the dish aren’t overwhelmed. You can create a good match by echoing the ingredients in your food with the characteristics in the wine, for example, asparagus with Sauvignon Blanc, a spicy Shiraz with fragrant Asian dishes, or an earthy Pinot enjoyed with anything containing mushrooms. Don’t forget that the dominant feature of a dish can sometimes be the sauce rather than the main ingredient, so use that as your guide. Some wines can suffer in the presence of chilli, but others are ideal. Lower alcohol whites like Riesling and Semillon work really well, as they have high acidity and pair well with fried dishes, and with ingredients high in salt like soy sauce. A spicy red like Shiraz is arguably the best red all-rounder with spicy Asian food – just avoid wines that are too high in alcohol or tannins, as they will accentuate any heat present. Slightly off-dry Rieslings can have a calming effect on spicy food and don’t forget the option of starting the meal with a cold beer. Tannins love fat\nTannins are the astringent structural components in wine and when the tannins are obvious, a meal with a high fat content will soften the mouth-feel and create overall harmony. Great examples are slow roasted lamb shoulder or Parmigiano Reggiano with Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wines. Fire up the barbeque and enjoy a robust Malbec with a fatty prime rib or juicy pork sausage. Acid loves acid, salt & fat\nHigh acid wines harmonise well with the natural acidity in food, with a crisp white paired with a salad featuring a zingy vinaigrette being a good example. Acid also balances fat, so beer-battered fish & chips are best served with a zesty white like Pinot Grigio, Riesling or a Classic White Blend. White wine with white meat & red wine with red meat? There is no right or wrong, but certain varieties do have a natural affinity – think chicken and Chardonnay, or pork and Pinot, however, accompanying sauces & the cooking method may influence your ultimate choice. Add a bunch of Italian herbs and white wine to your chicken dish and you should lean towards a Pinot Grigio, or whip up a slow cooked pork ragu with tomato and olives and a Barbera would be a better choice. Balance remains the key consideration, and neither the wine nor the dish should overpower the other. And don’t forget that gutsier whites like Chardonnay, Roussanne and Viognier can have more than enough weight to pair with a dish normally associated with a red wine match. Don’t forget the fifth taste – Umami\nDiscovered in Japan, and responsible for a heightened sense of deliciousness, umami drives the flavour X-factor in foods as diverse as mushrooms, tomatoes, anchovies, hard cheese, red meat, tomato sauce and Vegemite! Chefs and home cooks are increasing the use of foods rich in umami, which makes wine matching with these foods even more exciting. Start with a match that is well proven, like duck and Pinot, then add a mushroom component to ramp up the flavour complexity. What about desserts? The main consideration with a sweet pairing is that the wine is as sweet or sweeter than the dessert, as a dessert that’s sweeter that the wine will make the wine taste dull and knock out its character. Wines with a bit of fizz like Moscato or sweeter-style Prosecco can also be wonderful with fruit-based desserts or even the classic combination of melon and prosciutto enjoyed as part of an antipasto spread.

You want both the food and wine to stand up nicely and not overpower one another. We recommend that you look at the dish as a whole, not just the main component or protein of the dish. At the winery, we pay close attention to the sauces, spices, and smaller items that are part of the entire plate. The end goal is to make everything sing and dance together in harmony. Below are a few tips on where to begin your epicurean journey. 3 Styles of Pairings\nComplimentary – multiple components of a dish have similar flavors to the wine. However, you still want some qualities that are different. We like to recommend that when going with the ‘complimentary’ style, acid and tannins really help liven up the pairing while accentuating the fruit without being boring. Contrast – pairing a wine with a dish that has very little or no similar components. For example, sweet and salty or spicy creamy. A wonderful pairing is Mahi Tacos with Habanero Mango Aioli paired with our Viognier. The creaminess of the wine tones down the spice of the aioli while allowing the flavors to shine. The acid cuts through the weight of the aioli keeping the dish fresh and bright. Regional – Regional matches aren’t always the perfect pairing but they do work, especially if you’re short on time. They are a great way to begin to understand more about what’s going on structurally with wine and food pairings. Ask yourself, where does this varietal originate from? A great example of a regional pairing is Paella and Tempranillo. Both originate from Spain’s Rioja region. Another classic is Barbera and Truffles. A good way to think about this is people have been making this wine and cooking this food together for hundreds of years. It WILL be good. Tips to Pair\nAcid and Fat – Nothing cuts through fat like wine with great acidity. A good glass of Sparkling or Champagne is a classic. Pairing a high acid wine with a heavy dish brings out an array of interesting flavors. Acidity in wine pairs well with fatty and sweet foods. The acidity gives the wine a ‘backbone’ to stand up to the food. Alcohol can be used to cut through fatty foods or balance a sweet dish. The high alcohol prevents the food from overpowering the wine. Fruit Characteristics – A good guide is to pair similar color fruit characteristics with a wine. For example, pair red fruits with red fruit wine qualities. Pair blue fruit with blue fruit qualities. Adding contrasting fruits often will counter balance. Bitter and Fat elevate each other and is a classic pairing. The bitterness mellows out the fat letting other qualities step forward. Bitter with bitter does not work. Fat is needed to alleviate bitterness. Fat and Creamy benefit from acid and\/or a little bit of tartness. For example, our White Wine blend with Chicken Picatta is a game changer. The wine’s acid and fruit really accentuates the flavors and seasonings of the sauce and chicken. Fatty foods need either an acidic or high alcohol wine, otherwise the fat overwhelms the wine and it tastes flabby. Salty shouldn’t compete with acidity in wine. Too much salt and acid together is not good. Spicy foods pair well with sweeter wines and more full-bodied creamy whites. An oaky, malolactic white wine and spicy Cuban dishes are excellent pairings. Sweet and Salty – Ever have chocolate covered pretzels or candied maple bacon? The salt and sweet battle each other but it ends up being a tug of war of deliciousness. A little bit of salt opens your taste bud receptors making sweet dishes (like chocolate) taste even richer or sweeter. Sweet food\/wine benefits from a little acidity. The acid helps cut through the sweet to let the flavors step forward. Very tannic wine can be balanced with a sweet food. Some tannic wines (based on flavor components) can go well with fat. Masculine, opulent, dark fruit wines with great tannic structure go phenomenally well with rich steak dishes. Wine acid and food acid need to be similar. If the wine has less acidity than the food, the wine tastes flat.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:aafdea38-f3cc-4b99-8d19-29d974aeeaaf>"]},{"passage":"Part 2: Wine -Food Pairing\nIn the previous post I discussed how wine glasses are uniquely shaped to alter the wine’s taste and aroma, therefore, changing our experience and even our enjoyment with the wine. If you haven’t read the article, you can read it here. It is definitely an informative post for those who want to learn more about wine and for those who enjoy wine. For those of you who love to entertain, this post is for you! I will discuss wine and food pairings. When wine is paired with the proper food, it adds a whole new dimension to our experience of enjoying wine. In the past, I have always thought the general rule to pairing food with wine was to match the color of the wine to that of the food. For example, I thought red wine goes with red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and white wine goes well with white meat (chicken, fish and shellfish). Simple and easy? Well, I mentioned before that there are a lot of complexity with wine. To gain harmony with your food and wine pairing, you actually want to match the acidity, sweetness and strength of flavor of the wine to the food. For a rich full bodied wine you want to pair it with rich food. Sweet wines pairs well with sweet and spicy food. And interestingly, salty food pairs well with sweet and acidic wine. If you recall, in the last post, we looked at 4 different wines made by Pacific Breeze Urban Winery in New Westminster, BC. They are the Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. I have included links to Pacific Breeze catalog for those who may be interested in purchasing their wines. The one thing that stands out for me in regards to Sauvignon Blanc is its freshness. When I took a sip of this wine, the first thing I said was “It’s so refreshing!”. It has aromas of cut grass, mingled with melon, citrus and apple. Sauvignon Blanc has high level of acidity pairing well with equally acidic food such as citrus and tomato based dishes or even salad with light vinaigrette dressing. The acidity in the wine also goes well with fried foods. For our evening, we were served lemon breaded chicken with a salad containing rocket greens, shaved fennel and orange wedges. Truly refreshing! Chardonnay is known as one of France’s great white wines. There is a difference in Chardonnay that has been oaked and unoaked. When Chardonnay has been oaked, the oak is able to impart flavors of buttery and\/or creamy caramel, vanilla, toast and spice; as well, it gives a richer color to the wine. Unoaked varieties will have a more fresh fruit flavor. Some of the fruit aroma can range from citrus and stone fruits (peaches, cherries and plums) to tropical fruits (pineapple). Oaked Chardonnay also have a richer and fuller appearance than those of unoaked Chardonnay. At Pacific Breeze we tried an oaked Chardonnay style which had a hint of butterscotch. Due to its rich and buttery flavor it was paired with Risotto with petite pois and parmesan cheese. Pinot Noir is the most food friendly of the wines because it is able to complement with the widest variety of food. The body and color of Pinot Noir is lighter than the Cabernet Sauvignon. It is light but still have complexity in its flavor. It has moderate level of tannin pairing it well with richer meats such as lamb and duck. But the tannin is also soft enough to go with white meats such as salmon and chicken. It has an earthy flavor pairing well with fruits and vegetable such as mushrooms and figs. On the nose you can smell aroma of berries with earthy tones of mushroom and leather. This wine has not yet been released by Pacific Breeze, but it is wonderful! We tested our palate with goat cheese and Prosciutto wrapped figs. The last wine on our list is the Cabernet Sauvignon, a widely recognized red wine grape variety. It is a wine that is commonly blended with other varieties of wine, such as the Merlot and the Cabernet Franc, to make the Bordeaux blends.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:12e9cb6f-44cb-4688-b3bc-e639bc1ed27a>"]},{"passage":"You may have noticed that we've begun to incorporate pairing suggestions with some of our products, beginning with our red meats, like a Bonanza Cabernet Sauvignon by Caymus with our Chuck Roast (one of Bryce's favorites). We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red\/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4b634eaa-a56c-4862-a942-9b9d74bf4a5c>"]},{"passage":"Welcome to Wine by Alex, the show to watch to take your wine game to the next level! Today you’re watching the first episode of #Askwinebyalex of 2021. I’ve got a question from Alessio of @alevalente91:\n« Alex, can you remind me of the basics of food and wine pairing? »\nAlessio, that’s such a great question! I’ve done a few posts about this topic a while ago. And I was actually thinking to do a video to refresh the information. So you’re right on time! Few things to take into account for food & wine pairings\nEveryone’s perception and taste are different\nSome people are very sensitive, others don’t. The same level of sweetness or acidity can be perceived totally differently by two persons. On top of that, we all have our own personal taste. Some people like bitterness, others don’t. Every one of us is totally different. So you might enjoy your pairings, but it may not be the case of the people around you. Food is generally responsible of bad interaction, not wine\nFood and wine have a mutual influence on each other. The goal here is to have more pleasure having food and wine together, rather than separately. And also to avoid any unfortunate pairings. Now that everything is settled, let’s dive into the basics of food and wine pairing! You’ve got to understand there are 2 elements in food that will improve wine and 2 elements that will spoil it. The 2 wine-friendly elements in food: acidity and saltiness\nI’ll start with the 2 elements that will improve the wine you’re tasting: acidity and saltiness. They increase pleasant sensations in wine: sweetness, fruitiness and body. They also decrease the unpleasant sensations in wine, like astringency, bitterness and too strong acidity. Salty meals go with basically every wine and the great thing is that they’ll enhance wine aromas. So it’s all beneficial to you! Be careful to pair acid meals with wines that are even more acidic. Otherwise, they’ll just seem flat. - Think about Champagne, Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Pinot Noir,…\nThe 2 elements unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami\nNow let’s talk about the 2 elements in food that will be unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami. Not only they increase unpleasant sensations in wine: astringency, bitterness, too strong acidity, alcohol burn. But they also decrease pleasant sensations like sweetness, fruitiness and body… So as you probably guessed by now, they’re quite hard to pair with wine. But, what’s umami? It’s a taste that combines saltiness and bitterness. You’ll find it a lot in Asian food like soy sauce or miso soup, but also in asparagus, eggs, mushrooms and oysters. You need to pair sweet meals with wines that are even sweeter. This way, you’ll increase their fruitiness and balance the acidity that might be increased by the food. Meals that contain umami need to be paired with very fruity wines and, if you want a red wine, choose one that has low tannins. This way you’ll increase the fruitiness and diminish the astringent sensation of tannins. - When you have meals with umami, think about Beaujolais, unoaked Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay from Mâcon. - When you have sweet meals, go all out with a Sauternes, Barsac, Tokaji Aszu or a PX. Other consideration you can take into account\nIt can be tricky to pair spicy food with wine because the spiciness increases alcohol burn and bitterness of a wine. - Think about wines with low tannins and low alcohol. Also try to choose very fruity wines with a bit of sweetness, like Pinot Gris. Similar aromatic intensity\nI said earlier that food and wine pairings are supposed to give you more pleasure than if you were having the food, or the wine, separately. This means you also have to consider the aromatic intensity when you make your pairings! You don’t want to have one element hidden by the other one.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:60947fe9-3ef8-45b3-b03a-ecf8977520eb>"]},{"passage":"A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

Maybe you are into a specific type of music and maybe you like 1 or 2 genres more, but the thing is, most people prefer just one genre. This can be useful to new musicians, due to the fact they can start their career in the music genre that is most popular. This would definitely make the things easier. You may believe that POP music is the #1 in the world, but it isn’t. Now you will see the most popular music genres in the world. - Heavy Metal\nOnce treated as outcasts, the musicians of this genre are today the number one when it comes to the music popularity.

Examples of music genres are:\n- EDM (Electronic Dance Music)\n- Afro Pop\n- Gospel and many others\nWemix has compiled a list of 5 components of musical genres that will help you distinguish one genre from the other namely:\nThe songwriting style of a particular genre:\nThe lyrics of a lot of church hymns were written in a poetic style with the last word of a phrase often rhyming with last word of another phrase within the same stanza. For example “Hark The Herald Angels Sing” By Charles Wesley:\nNotice how the last word of the first phrase (sing) rhymes with the last word of the second phrase (king). 2. The prominent instruments used to produce or perform that style of music:\n- In traditional Ugandan music, some of the common instruments used are the harp (Adungu), xylophone (Akadinda), drums (Engoma), rattles (Ebinyege) and ankle bells (Endege). - For reggae music, “The drums are the backbone and the bass guitar is the driving force.”\nImage 2 and 3\n- The electric guitar is the central instrument in rock music. Image 4 and 5\n3. Signature dance moves and choreography:\n- Hip Hop music is and has been characterized by dance moves such as breaking, popping, and locking. - Salsa is a popular form of social dance that often accompanies Salsa music. 4. Symbols and Colors of A Music Genre. - What is the significance of reggae colors, green, yellow and red? Rastafarianism was a religion formed in Jamaica in the 1930s where they recognized Haile Sellasie, the emperor of Ethiopia as their God. The Ethiopian flag has the colors of green, yellow, and red to represent Africa, but to Rastafarians, these colors meant something else. The Red represents the lives lost in the struggle with colonial powers in Ethiopia.The Green represents the vegetation and beauty of Africa while the yellow represents the gold that was looted from Africa in times past. 5. Methods of creation, production and distribution of an album:\nThe term mixtape used to refer to a homemade compilation of songs recorded onto an audio cassette. I started making the “traditional” mixtape around the age of 13. I was a very loyal fan of Power Fm, a Christian radio station in Uganda and I listened to every show whenever I could get my hands on a radio. The Dance Party on Saturday night with the Machine Man Rwabs was always the highlight of my weekend. I got tired of waiting for my favorite songs to play on radio so I would put a cassette our radio and record my songs whenever they played on radio. I was doing this in the year 2003 but this was a very common practice in the 70s and 80s in the United States when cassette tapes were a prime medium of music distribution. Hip hop mixtapes emerged in the 1970s in New York City when people would record live DJ performances by the said founders of hip hop, Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaata on cassettes and then distribute them. Currently, the word mixtape is used to describe full-length albums released for free. Mixtapes have helped further the careers of rappers like Ruyonga and Lecrae. Ruyonga’s mixtapes, “Victory Lap” and “God Over Money” have featured original songs and instrumentals from songs by other musicians. On the other hand, Lecrae’s mixtape series, “Church Clothes” has featured original music only. An avid listener of reggae music has probably realized that a lot of reggae songs seem to use the same instrumental – a riddim. “What is a Riddim?” you may ask. A riddim is typically a bassline and usually a special drum pattern is used with the bassline. The word “riddim” is the Jamaican patois word for rhythm. Riddims tend to follow “a rub a dub dub, a rub a dub dub pattern.”In the world of reggae music, artists and producers often take an existing instrumental song (riddim), record a new voicing over it, and re-release it as if it were a completely new song. Producers may also produce a beat (riddim) and contract artists to voice over it. Below is the Plead Riddim Produced By Lion Of Judah Music Group.\n\nReview of Short Phrases and Links|\nThis Review contains major \"Genres\"- related terms, short phrases and links grouped together in the form of Encyclopedia article. - GENRES is a platform for the support of international co-operation between relevant institutions and organisations in Germany and in partner countries. - Genres are formed by sets of conventions, and many works cross into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. - Genres are often divided into subgenres. - The genres were graded in order of importance, starting at the top: history painting, the portrait, genre painting, still-life and landscape. - Other genres were also represented in Latin: the mock epic, the fabliau, the romance, the beast tale, the folk story. - Terry Manning is a music producer, songwriter, photographer and recording engineer known for work in rock, rhythm and blues, and pop music genres. - These early 'Dub' examples can be looked upon as the prelude to many dance and pop music genres. - In addition to that, screamo has significant overlap with other genres like grindcore and even post rock. - One well-known characteristic of grindcore and related genres is the microsong; songs lasting seconds. - Genres such as metalcore, grindcore and crossover thrash were greatly influenced by punk and heavy metal. - The genres of crossover thrash, thrashcore and metalcore grew out of this fusion. - This was the first house record pressed and sold to the general public and presaged many later genres of electronic dance music such as acid trance. - Michael Woods is a UK producer and remixer of various music genres, including electronic, trance, dance, and jazz. - DJ Nexus - Browse trance, house, techno, breakbeat, drum & bass, downtempo, and other dance music genres from best record stores online. - Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPGs, such as statistical character development, have been widely adapted to other video game genres. - Such genres include puzzle games, such as Tetris, and plot-based role-playing games (RPGs), such as the Final Fantasy series. - Many RPGs have rules designed for a specific genres such as sword and sorcery, or specific universes such as Star Wars. - System Shock 2 is similar to its predecessor in that it is a hybrid encompassing many gameplay elements from various genres. - In the United States, the western has had an extremely rich history that spans many genres (comedy, drama, tragedy, parody, musical, etc.). - Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. - Tragicomedy (or dark comedy or black comedy) refers to fictional works that blend aspects of the genres of tragedy and comedy. - Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. - It is now a common archetype in Samurai films and Western films as well as other genres.

So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.\n\nWhat does music mean to you? What is your “go to” sounds? With all of the genres to choose from, a person can find something to brighten their moment. The soothing sounds of an orchestra or the uplifting lyrics of Christian can lift a somber mood, get someone through grief, or even give comfort to the sick. Country and love songs remind us of love gone bad – or good. The lyrics tell of dreams found, lovers lost. Rock and Pop can get those feet moving, get a body energized. Music completes me. It is a part of what I am made of. Whether I am riding in my car, sitting outside enjoying the fresh air, or writing a scene in one of my books, music is in my soul. I love putting songs in my writing, letting my characters get lost in the sounds of instruments and allowing the lyrics to have meaning in their lives. I listen to everything from Classic, Christian, Pop, 80’s (of course! ), Country, Jazz, and whatever else…\nWhat are some of your favorite songs? What genre of music do you find yourself listening to most often? Do you have a favorite artist or group? Throw those comments out there, let’s see what you like. *** Smoke and Mirrors mentions several songs. I have a contest going on for the month of July in my newsletter, Taylor’s Tidbits. Sign up, receive this month’s Tidbit, and enter the contest. Taylor’s Tidbits sign up\nTill next time – Love, hugs, and kisses – Taylor\n\nTopic «Music» (Топик на английском языке «Музыка»)\nWhat is music? Do you think it’s just a combination of pleasant sounds and nothing more? Of course not! Music is a huge world of the variety of feelings. It is a mirror, which reflects our soul. Nothing can be as impressive as music. It cries with us when we are sad, it laughs when we are happy. It can totally change our mood. We need music as we need food. Without it our life won’t be so bright and beautiful. The perception of music and a great love of it distinguish humans from animals. Music unites people. Many of them communicate with the help of it. Music helps to get acquainted with new interesting people and to make friends, it can become a reason for quarrel. Music influences people’s mind and even can make them perform some strange actions. We can hear sounds of music play every time and everywhere. We hear music in transport, at home, on the radio. Why is it so popular? Firstly it is a necessary part of our life. It was created at the ancient times. People tried to attract the spirit by playing music and dancing. People thought that spirits would help them in hunting. The first instruments appeared at that time. Secondly, scientists have revealed that music influences people’s feelings. That’s why music is widely used in public places. For example slow, calm music in supermarkets makes people buy more goods. In restaurants good, quiet music stimulates appetite; on TV it makes shows brighter and more exciting. Music plays an important role in films. It emphasizes the depth of feelings of actors. It makes tense moments more exciting, pleasant moments more tender. Films would be boring and not interesting without music. Of course music is a really necessary part of my own life. I cannot exist without listening to the music. I listen to music all the time and everywhere if it is only possible. I usually use it as background when I’m playing pc games, painting, browsing internet, taking a shower, cooking and socializing with my friends. Music encourages me when I’m playing, inspires me when I’m creating something and makes funny when I’m with my friends. But for me it’s only possible to listen well known music as background, because when unknown music is playing I don’t hear it as I’m totally absorbed in my business. If I turn my attention to the music I will not concentrate on my work. That’s why calm, melodic and familiar music will be the best variant. But there are some songs while listening to them I cannot do anything. I can only enjoy their sounds, they transport me into my own world where I can really relax and forget about everything. Music is divided into genres and styles. Nowadays a lot of different genres exist. Some of them have appeared rather recently. Such a variety of genres helps everyone to find the most suitable for him. And why do different people like different music? — Because of their different spiritual world and emotional tendencies. I have more than fifty favorite genres. But the most favorite are only three. They are emo-trans, alternative metal and indie-rock. Indie-rock is a really wide and quite independent kind of music genre. It’s like a mixture of many other genres. Every song can be totally different from another one. This genre can express all people’s\nfeelings from love to hatred, from glory to disgrace, from courage to shame. It is really popular in Great Britain. The basic instruments in this kind of music are the bass-guitar, the solo-guitar and the drums. Very often it has the subsidiary instruments such as the piano, violin, saxophone and so on. The subsidiary instrument makes this music more expressive. Alternative metal is rather heavy music. Not everyone can listen to it. But I like this genre very much. It refreshes me and makes feel cheerful. Emo-trans is a so extraordinary music genre. It consists of two different music styles. It is something between live music, electronic music and screaming voices. I know only one group in this genre for this moment. It is called Enter Shikari. I can find in their music everything what I need. That is why I like them so much. Their songs consist of many different parts. It is very important for me. I don’t like monotonous melodies. Every part of the song expresses different feelings and emotions.","passages":[{"passage":"Every man today fits under at least one classification of music essays related to music classifications 1 the classification of film, genre also.

Examples of music genres are:\n- EDM (Electronic Dance Music)\n- Afro Pop\n- Gospel and many others\nWemix has compiled a list of 5 components of musical genres that will help you distinguish one genre from the other namely:\nThe songwriting style of a particular genre:\nThe lyrics of a lot of church hymns were written in a poetic style with the last word of a phrase often rhyming with last word of another phrase within the same stanza. For example “Hark The Herald Angels Sing” By Charles Wesley:\nNotice how the last word of the first phrase (sing) rhymes with the last word of the second phrase (king). 2. The prominent instruments used to produce or perform that style of music:\n- In traditional Ugandan music, some of the common instruments used are the harp (Adungu), xylophone (Akadinda), drums (Engoma), rattles (Ebinyege) and ankle bells (Endege). - For reggae music, “The drums are the backbone and the bass guitar is the driving force.”\nImage 2 and 3\n- The electric guitar is the central instrument in rock music. Image 4 and 5\n3. Signature dance moves and choreography:\n- Hip Hop music is and has been characterized by dance moves such as breaking, popping, and locking. - Salsa is a popular form of social dance that often accompanies Salsa music. 4. Symbols and Colors of A Music Genre. - What is the significance of reggae colors, green, yellow and red? Rastafarianism was a religion formed in Jamaica in the 1930s where they recognized Haile Sellasie, the emperor of Ethiopia as their God. The Ethiopian flag has the colors of green, yellow, and red to represent Africa, but to Rastafarians, these colors meant something else. The Red represents the lives lost in the struggle with colonial powers in Ethiopia.The Green represents the vegetation and beauty of Africa while the yellow represents the gold that was looted from Africa in times past. 5. Methods of creation, production and distribution of an album:\nThe term mixtape used to refer to a homemade compilation of songs recorded onto an audio cassette. I started making the “traditional” mixtape around the age of 13. I was a very loyal fan of Power Fm, a Christian radio station in Uganda and I listened to every show whenever I could get my hands on a radio. The Dance Party on Saturday night with the Machine Man Rwabs was always the highlight of my weekend. I got tired of waiting for my favorite songs to play on radio so I would put a cassette our radio and record my songs whenever they played on radio. I was doing this in the year 2003 but this was a very common practice in the 70s and 80s in the United States when cassette tapes were a prime medium of music distribution. Hip hop mixtapes emerged in the 1970s in New York City when people would record live DJ performances by the said founders of hip hop, Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaata on cassettes and then distribute them. Currently, the word mixtape is used to describe full-length albums released for free. Mixtapes have helped further the careers of rappers like Ruyonga and Lecrae. Ruyonga’s mixtapes, “Victory Lap” and “God Over Money” have featured original songs and instrumentals from songs by other musicians. On the other hand, Lecrae’s mixtape series, “Church Clothes” has featured original music only. An avid listener of reggae music has probably realized that a lot of reggae songs seem to use the same instrumental – a riddim. “What is a Riddim?” you may ask. A riddim is typically a bassline and usually a special drum pattern is used with the bassline. The word “riddim” is the Jamaican patois word for rhythm. Riddims tend to follow “a rub a dub dub, a rub a dub dub pattern.”In the world of reggae music, artists and producers often take an existing instrumental song (riddim), record a new voicing over it, and re-release it as if it were a completely new song. Producers may also produce a beat (riddim) and contract artists to voice over it. Below is the Plead Riddim Produced By Lion Of Judah Music Group.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bd851888-499d-4deb-a7dd-034d64b55615>"]},{"passage":"Review of Short Phrases and Links|\nThis Review contains major \"Genres\"- related terms, short phrases and links grouped together in the form of Encyclopedia article. - GENRES is a platform for the support of international co-operation between relevant institutions and organisations in Germany and in partner countries. - Genres are formed by sets of conventions, and many works cross into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. - Genres are often divided into subgenres. - The genres were graded in order of importance, starting at the top: history painting, the portrait, genre painting, still-life and landscape. - Other genres were also represented in Latin: the mock epic, the fabliau, the romance, the beast tale, the folk story. - Terry Manning is a music producer, songwriter, photographer and recording engineer known for work in rock, rhythm and blues, and pop music genres. - These early 'Dub' examples can be looked upon as the prelude to many dance and pop music genres. - In addition to that, screamo has significant overlap with other genres like grindcore and even post rock. - One well-known characteristic of grindcore and related genres is the microsong; songs lasting seconds. - Genres such as metalcore, grindcore and crossover thrash were greatly influenced by punk and heavy metal. - The genres of crossover thrash, thrashcore and metalcore grew out of this fusion. - This was the first house record pressed and sold to the general public and presaged many later genres of electronic dance music such as acid trance. - Michael Woods is a UK producer and remixer of various music genres, including electronic, trance, dance, and jazz. - DJ Nexus - Browse trance, house, techno, breakbeat, drum & bass, downtempo, and other dance music genres from best record stores online. - Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPGs, such as statistical character development, have been widely adapted to other video game genres. - Such genres include puzzle games, such as Tetris, and plot-based role-playing games (RPGs), such as the Final Fantasy series. - Many RPGs have rules designed for a specific genres such as sword and sorcery, or specific universes such as Star Wars. - System Shock 2 is similar to its predecessor in that it is a hybrid encompassing many gameplay elements from various genres. - In the United States, the western has had an extremely rich history that spans many genres (comedy, drama, tragedy, parody, musical, etc.). - Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. - Tragicomedy (or dark comedy or black comedy) refers to fictional works that blend aspects of the genres of tragedy and comedy. - Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. - It is now a common archetype in Samurai films and Western films as well as other genres.

So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:01af8715-cb18-459c-8f20-ce26682c3249>"]},{"passage":"What does music mean to you? What is your “go to” sounds? With all of the genres to choose from, a person can find something to brighten their moment. The soothing sounds of an orchestra or the uplifting lyrics of Christian can lift a somber mood, get someone through grief, or even give comfort to the sick. Country and love songs remind us of love gone bad – or good. The lyrics tell of dreams found, lovers lost. Rock and Pop can get those feet moving, get a body energized. Music completes me. It is a part of what I am made of. Whether I am riding in my car, sitting outside enjoying the fresh air, or writing a scene in one of my books, music is in my soul. I love putting songs in my writing, letting my characters get lost in the sounds of instruments and allowing the lyrics to have meaning in their lives. I listen to everything from Classic, Christian, Pop, 80’s (of course! ), Country, Jazz, and whatever else…\nWhat are some of your favorite songs? What genre of music do you find yourself listening to most often? Do you have a favorite artist or group? Throw those comments out there, let’s see what you like. *** Smoke and Mirrors mentions several songs. I have a contest going on for the month of July in my newsletter, Taylor’s Tidbits.

Do you think it’s just a combination of pleasant sounds and nothing more? Of course not! Music is a huge world of the variety of feelings. It is a mirror, which reflects our soul. Nothing can be as impressive as music. It cries with us when we are sad, it laughs when we are happy. It can totally change our mood. We need music as we need food. Without it our life won’t be so bright and beautiful. The perception of music and a great love of it distinguish humans from animals. Music unites people. Many of them communicate with the help of it. Music helps to get acquainted with new interesting people and to make friends, it can become a reason for quarrel. Music influences people’s mind and even can make them perform some strange actions. We can hear sounds of music play every time and everywhere. We hear music in transport, at home, on the radio. Why is it so popular? Firstly it is a necessary part of our life. It was created at the ancient times. People tried to attract the spirit by playing music and dancing. People thought that spirits would help them in hunting. The first instruments appeared at that time. Secondly, scientists have revealed that music influences people’s feelings. That’s why music is widely used in public places. For example slow, calm music in supermarkets makes people buy more goods. In restaurants good, quiet music stimulates appetite; on TV it makes shows brighter and more exciting. Music plays an important role in films. It emphasizes the depth of feelings of actors. It makes tense moments more exciting, pleasant moments more tender. Films would be boring and not interesting without music. Of course music is a really necessary part of my own life. I cannot exist without listening to the music. I listen to music all the time and everywhere if it is only possible. I usually use it as background when I’m playing pc games, painting, browsing internet, taking a shower, cooking and socializing with my friends. Music encourages me when I’m playing, inspires me when I’m creating something and makes funny when I’m with my friends. But for me it’s only possible to listen well known music as background, because when unknown music is playing I don’t hear it as I’m totally absorbed in my business. If I turn my attention to the music I will not concentrate on my work. That’s why calm, melodic and familiar music will be the best variant. But there are some songs while listening to them I cannot do anything. I can only enjoy their sounds, they transport me into my own world where I can really relax and forget about everything. Music is divided into genres and styles. Nowadays a lot of different genres exist. Some of them have appeared rather recently. Such a variety of genres helps everyone to find the most suitable for him. And why do different people like different music? — Because of their different spiritual world and emotional tendencies. I have more than fifty favorite genres. But the most favorite are only three. They are emo-trans, alternative metal and indie-rock. Indie-rock is a really wide and quite independent kind of music genre. It’s like a mixture of many other genres. Every song can be totally different from another one. This genre can express all people’s\nfeelings from love to hatred, from glory to disgrace, from courage to shame. It is really popular in Great Britain. The basic instruments in this kind of music are the bass-guitar, the solo-guitar and the drums. Very often it has the subsidiary instruments such as the piano, violin, saxophone and so on. The subsidiary instrument makes this music more expressive. Alternative metal is rather heavy music. Not everyone can listen to it. But I like this genre very much. It refreshes me and makes feel cheerful. Emo-trans is a so extraordinary music genre. It consists of two different music styles. It is something between live music, electronic music and screaming voices. I know only one group in this genre for this moment. It is called Enter Shikari. I can find in their music everything what I need. That is why I like them so much. Their songs consist of many different parts. It is very important for me. I don’t like monotonous melodies. Every part of the song expresses different feelings and emotions.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:45aaa135-e578-412d-bc16-656daca07c0a>"]}]}

In January 1997, once the VRML Consortium was established and sufficient number of organizations had joined as voting members, elections for a new Board of Directors were held in accordance with the approved by-laws. Control was passed from the interim to the elected Board of Directors at the VRML 97 Symposium in Monterey, California on February 23, 1997. Initial members of the Consortium included thirty five leading Internet companies: 3Dlabs, Inc., Apple Computer, Inc., Axial Systems, Inc., Black Sun Interactive, Inc., Construct Internet Design Co., dFORM Inc., Division Ltd., First Virtual Holdings, Inc., IBM Corp., Integrated Data Systems, Intel Corp., Intervista Software, Inc., Kinetix, Microsoft Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, Inc., Netscape Communications Corp., Oracle Corp., ParaGraph International, S3, Inc., SENSE8 Corp., Silicon Graphics, Inc., Sony Corp., Superscape Inc., Template Graphics Software, Inc. and Visible Decisions Inc. Other members included academic institutions (such as the Naval Postgraduate School, Brown University and the San Diego Supercomputer Center) and governmental entities (such as the USA's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)). During the first Board of Directors meeting, the VRML Consortium accepted and endorsed the existing Cooperative Agreement with JTC 1. Since the founding of the VRML Consortium, considerable interest has been shown in VRML 97 and its success has broadened the scope of interest in 3D on the World Wide Web. To more adequately represent this more varied interest, in September 1998, the VRML Consortium voted to become the Web 3D Consortium with a widened mandate to represent all 3D technology for the Web. The VRML Consortium is in the process of formally changing its name and updating its by-laws. Recall that the CD ballot for VRML closed in December 1996 and the coeditors worked for four months, producing the text of DIS 14772-1 in April 1997. This was then balloted within ISO\/IEC JTC 1. The comments from the DIS ballot were processed in October 1997 . There were many fewer comments during this review attesting to an improvement in quality of the specification. Making the required changes took a further two months. In December 1997, the final text was submitted for publication as VRML 97 . To facilitate printing the standard, separate hardcopy versions for ISO (with ISO copyrights) and the VRML Consortium (with VRML Consortium copyrights) were produced in Word 97. Page numbers were added for easier reference. The ISO hardcopy version has been printed and is accompanied by a CD-ROM containing the HTML version. The VRML Consortium hardcopy and softcopy versions are available from http:\/\/www.vrml.org\/Specifications. The VRML community has diverse participation. While there is representation from the research community, there is also wide participation from both the Internet development community as well as from the creative community who design VRML content for the web. Several key factors had an important influence on the development of VRML:\nBecause of the above factors, the VRML community was able to coalesce and work together. While a few of the participants had worked together before, most became acquainted during the development effort, so it was not a case of a team that had worked together successfully before being applied to a new problem. The development of the VRML standard is one of very few successful examples of an \"Internet\" standard being processed to become an International Standard. Initially, considerable effort was expended by the leadership of both the VRML community and of SC 24 to overcome the traditional hostility and clash of styles between the Internet community and ISO. Today, each community has come to realize the value that the other contributes to the standardization process and how a coordinated approach based on combining the best that each community has to offer can be an effective model for standards development. The three most important lessons learned were:\nIn the early and intensely creative stages of specification development, the use of Internet style discussion lists was very valuable. The VRML Community used this technique to great success in soliciting proposals, evaluating them, and refining their initial products.\n\nIndividuals from all major interested vendors participated, and this helped build worldwide consensus. VRML was developed as an open standard instilled with the principle that high quality infrastructures can be built in the open on level playing fields. The result has been faster and better products as well as more interesting and productive market competition based on value, not history or platform dependence. The product of an Internet style development is often referred to as \"rough consensus and working code.\" When the experts of SC 24 got involved, it was evident that this was a fair characterization of the VRML 2.0 Specification. The VRML Community had created an excellent specification based on the right ideas, but one that still needed editorial and technical work to attain the quality expected of an International Standard. Since the initial VRML 2.0 draft was based on new technology, the experts of SC 24 worked hard to increase the descriptiveness of the early drafts. The first result was CD quality text was produced in about 2 months. The step to DIS required considerably more effort and clearly showed the value of SC 24 processes. When a standard moves to DIS, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish the necessary work by an Internet-style discussion list. What is required is careful, thoughtful review by independent groups of experts whose comments are consolidated and resolved at an editing meeting. In the case of VRML, it took a three day meeting by about a dozen experts to process the 200 pages of comments, followed by four additional months of work by the co-editors to make the agreed changes. A less intensive similar meeting was needed nine months later to process the comments on the DIS text and produce the final standard. VRML was developed under a cooperative agreement that proved key to keeping the work on track and resolving problems. Among the most important elements of the agreement was the constraint that no unnecessary technical changes would be made. Although at least four significant technical changes were actually made, both parties recognized each as being necessary. A second key constraint was that the work be accomplished on the shortest feasible schedule. In June 1997, SC 24 and the VRML Consortium mutually adopted the first revision to the original Cooperative Agreement. Under the revised agreement, SC 24 and the VRML Consortium will continue their cooperation to develop specifications for other areas of VRML technology and to make these into International Standards where appropriate. Early technical work will be accomplished principally within the Consortium's Working Groups where SC 24 experts as well any other individuals are free to participate without necessarily being Consortium members. Later stage technical and editorial work will be accomplished within SC 24 (with liaison from the VRML Consortium). Early in the development of VRML, it was decided that ambitious features (such as multi-user interaction or autonomous creatures that can sense and react to their environment) would not be part of the initial version. VRML Consortium Working Groups (with participation of SC 24 experts) are currently specifying, implementing and testing extensions in many areas. (A list of all approved working groups can be found at: http:\/\/www.vrml.org\/WorkingGroups\/ ). The best and most widely accepted extensions will become VRML Consortium Standards and then be processed to become International Standards. Among the areas of active current work are:\nIn addition, work has begun to identify requirements for a next generation VRML. The goal is to overcome some limitations in VRML 97 while maintaining as much compatibility as feasible given the constraints inherent in new requirements. When a draft is available, next generation VRML will be processed to become an International Standard, but this work will proceed only after sufficient agreement on requirements. Meanwhile, a first amendment to VRML 97 is being considered. This amendment will change VRML 97 to enhance its ability of interact with other technologies including MPEG-4. Both SC 24 and the VRML Consortium intend to follow consortium procedures for designing the functionality of new specifications and to decide whether a specification is appropriate for standardization. The product of consortium work can be either be a report not intended for standardization or a specification for additional functionality that may be submitted for standardization. The VRML Consortium has created the VRML Review Board (VRB) to oversee these activities and to determine the viability of each specification. SC 24 has a liaison representative who participates in the work of the VRB and serves as the primary technical interface between the two organizations.\n\nSite home page\nGet alerts when Linktionary is updated\nBook updates and addendums\nGet info about the Encyclopedia of Networking and Telecommunicatons, 3rd edition (2001)\nDownload the electronic version of the Encyclopedia of Networking, 2nd edition (1996).

Web3D is often called virtual reality modeling. It provides a way to deliver interactive 3D objects and artificial worlds across the Internet. An example would be a virtual tour of a house that is for sale in another city. You use a virtual reality-enabled browser to \"walk\" through the house, pointing left, right, forward, and so on. The Web3D Consortium describes Web3D as follows:\nWeb3D blends the intuitive human sense of space and time with user interface interaction and programming language integration producing a truly new and exciting technology for the Internet. The evolution of the Net from command-line to 2D graphical to emergent 3D interfaces reflects ongoing, fundamental progress toward human-centered interface design-that is, toward a more immersive and responsive computer-mediated experience. Open languages for programming and delivery Web3D include VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), Java3D, and X3D. VRML provides an interface that delivers virtual graphical three-dimensional worlds to users of Web browsers without consuming an exorbitant amount of bandwidth. VRML is based on an ASCII file format and three-dimensional modeling environments originally developed at Silicon Graphics. The key to VRML is that the descriptions of objects in the three-dimensional world (not the actual graphics) are transmitted to the user. This reduces the bandwidth requirements and makes virtual reality practical on the Web. Another key feature is scaling, which allows the user to move toward an object and watch that object grow in size. VRML provides information that describes an object, no matter what distance the viewer takes. Although VRML is a coding language, you won't need to do much coding to create virtual worlds. Instead, you create virtual worlds using tools that are essentially three-dimensional painting and modeling packages. VRML files have the extension .wrl (world) and their own MIME type.

It's useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototype, and as a mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides a machine-independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of builtin mathematical and programmatic functions. syslog-ng is a syslogd replacement for a wide variety of UNIX systems that supports IPv6 and is capable of transferring log messages reliably using TCP and SSL and filtering the content of messages using regular expressions. Both RFC3164 and RFC5424 style messages are handled, but more esoteric formats like BSD process accounting logs are supported too. Apart from regular text files, it supports storing messages into SQL and MongoDB databases, and forward messages to local processes via pipes or UNIX domain sockets. This makes syslog-ng ideal as an integration platform. syslog-ng supports extracting structured information from the traditionally text based syslog via csv-parser(), db-parser(), and patterndb. Tag based classification, rewriting messages, and outputting messages in JSON is also possible. This makes syslog-ng ideal for preprocessing events for further analysis, be that home-grown scripts or SIEM systems. syslog-ng scales well on today's multi processor and multi-core systems: reaching 1,000,000 messages per second is a reality for the simplest use cases. white_dune is a graphical VRML97\/X3DV editor, simple NURBS\/Superformula 3D modeller, animation tool, and VRML97\/X3DV commandline compiler in development.

In January 1997, once the VRML Consortium was established and sufficient number of organizations had joined as voting members, elections for a new Board of Directors were held in accordance with the approved by-laws. Control was passed from the interim to the elected Board of Directors at the VRML 97 Symposium in Monterey, California on February 23, 1997. Initial members of the Consortium included thirty five leading Internet companies: 3Dlabs, Inc., Apple Computer, Inc., Axial Systems, Inc., Black Sun Interactive, Inc., Construct Internet Design Co., dFORM Inc., Division Ltd., First Virtual Holdings, Inc., IBM Corp., Integrated Data Systems, Intel Corp., Intervista Software, Inc., Kinetix, Microsoft Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, Inc., Netscape Communications Corp., Oracle Corp., ParaGraph International, S3, Inc., SENSE8 Corp., Silicon Graphics, Inc., Sony Corp., Superscape Inc., Template Graphics Software, Inc. and Visible Decisions Inc. Other members included academic institutions (such as the Naval Postgraduate School, Brown University and the San Diego Supercomputer Center) and governmental entities (such as the USA's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)). During the first Board of Directors meeting, the VRML Consortium accepted and endorsed the existing Cooperative Agreement with JTC 1. Since the founding of the VRML Consortium, considerable interest has been shown in VRML 97 and its success has broadened the scope of interest in 3D on the World Wide Web. To more adequately represent this more varied interest, in September 1998, the VRML Consortium voted to become the Web 3D Consortium with a widened mandate to represent all 3D technology for the Web. The VRML Consortium is in the process of formally changing its name and updating its by-laws. Recall that the CD ballot for VRML closed in December 1996 and the coeditors worked for four months, producing the text of DIS 14772-1 in April 1997. This was then balloted within ISO\/IEC JTC 1. The comments from the DIS ballot were processed in October 1997 . There were many fewer comments during this review attesting to an improvement in quality of the specification. Making the required changes took a further two months. In December 1997, the final text was submitted for publication as VRML 97 . To facilitate printing the standard, separate hardcopy versions for ISO (with ISO copyrights) and the VRML Consortium (with VRML Consortium copyrights) were produced in Word 97. Page numbers were added for easier reference. The ISO hardcopy version has been printed and is accompanied by a CD-ROM containing the HTML version. The VRML Consortium hardcopy and softcopy versions are available from http:\/\/www.vrml.org\/Specifications. The VRML community has diverse participation. While there is representation from the research community, there is also wide participation from both the Internet development community as well as from the creative community who design VRML content for the web. Several key factors had an important influence on the development of VRML:\nBecause of the above factors, the VRML community was able to coalesce and work together. While a few of the participants had worked together before, most became acquainted during the development effort, so it was not a case of a team that had worked together successfully before being applied to a new problem. The development of the VRML standard is one of very few successful examples of an \"Internet\" standard being processed to become an International Standard. Initially, considerable effort was expended by the leadership of both the VRML community and of SC 24 to overcome the traditional hostility and clash of styles between the Internet community and ISO. Today, each community has come to realize the value that the other contributes to the standardization process and how a coordinated approach based on combining the best that each community has to offer can be an effective model for standards development. The three most important lessons learned were:\nIn the early and intensely creative stages of specification development, the use of Internet style discussion lists was very valuable. The VRML Community used this technique to great success in soliciting proposals, evaluating them, and refining their initial products.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4c48a327-796b-404d-8f32-ecbf5c0f361d>"]},{"passage":"Individuals from all major interested vendors participated, and this helped build worldwide consensus. VRML was developed as an open standard instilled with the principle that high quality infrastructures can be built in the open on level playing fields. The result has been faster and better products as well as more interesting and productive market competition based on value, not history or platform dependence. The product of an Internet style development is often referred to as \"rough consensus and working code.\" When the experts of SC 24 got involved, it was evident that this was a fair characterization of the VRML 2.0 Specification. The VRML Community had created an excellent specification based on the right ideas, but one that still needed editorial and technical work to attain the quality expected of an International Standard. Since the initial VRML 2.0 draft was based on new technology, the experts of SC 24 worked hard to increase the descriptiveness of the early drafts. The first result was CD quality text was produced in about 2 months. The step to DIS required considerably more effort and clearly showed the value of SC 24 processes. When a standard moves to DIS, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish the necessary work by an Internet-style discussion list. What is required is careful, thoughtful review by independent groups of experts whose comments are consolidated and resolved at an editing meeting. In the case of VRML, it took a three day meeting by about a dozen experts to process the 200 pages of comments, followed by four additional months of work by the co-editors to make the agreed changes. A less intensive similar meeting was needed nine months later to process the comments on the DIS text and produce the final standard. VRML was developed under a cooperative agreement that proved key to keeping the work on track and resolving problems. Among the most important elements of the agreement was the constraint that no unnecessary technical changes would be made. Although at least four significant technical changes were actually made, both parties recognized each as being necessary. A second key constraint was that the work be accomplished on the shortest feasible schedule. In June 1997, SC 24 and the VRML Consortium mutually adopted the first revision to the original Cooperative Agreement. Under the revised agreement, SC 24 and the VRML Consortium will continue their cooperation to develop specifications for other areas of VRML technology and to make these into International Standards where appropriate. Early technical work will be accomplished principally within the Consortium's Working Groups where SC 24 experts as well any other individuals are free to participate without necessarily being Consortium members. Later stage technical and editorial work will be accomplished within SC 24 (with liaison from the VRML Consortium). Early in the development of VRML, it was decided that ambitious features (such as multi-user interaction or autonomous creatures that can sense and react to their environment) would not be part of the initial version. VRML Consortium Working Groups (with participation of SC 24 experts) are currently specifying, implementing and testing extensions in many areas. (A list of all approved working groups can be found at: http:\/\/www.vrml.org\/WorkingGroups\/ ). The best and most widely accepted extensions will become VRML Consortium Standards and then be processed to become International Standards. Among the areas of active current work are:\nIn addition, work has begun to identify requirements for a next generation VRML. The goal is to overcome some limitations in VRML 97 while maintaining as much compatibility as feasible given the constraints inherent in new requirements. When a draft is available, next generation VRML will be processed to become an International Standard, but this work will proceed only after sufficient agreement on requirements. Meanwhile, a first amendment to VRML 97 is being considered. This amendment will change VRML 97 to enhance its ability of interact with other technologies including MPEG-4. Both SC 24 and the VRML Consortium intend to follow consortium procedures for designing the functionality of new specifications and to decide whether a specification is appropriate for standardization. The product of consortium work can be either be a report not intended for standardization or a specification for additional functionality that may be submitted for standardization. The VRML Consortium has created the VRML Review Board (VRB) to oversee these activities and to determine the viability of each specification. SC 24 has a liaison representative who participates in the work of the VRB and serves as the primary technical interface between the two organizations.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4c48a327-796b-404d-8f32-ecbf5c0f361d>"]},{"passage":"Site home page\nGet alerts when Linktionary is updated\nBook updates and addendums\nGet info about the Encyclopedia of Networking and Telecommunicatons, 3rd edition (2001)\nDownload the electronic version of the Encyclopedia of Networking, 2nd edition (1996).

Web3D is often called virtual reality modeling. It provides a way to deliver interactive 3D objects and artificial worlds across the Internet. An example would be a virtual tour of a house that is for sale in another city. You use a virtual reality-enabled browser to \"walk\" through the house, pointing left, right, forward, and so on. The Web3D Consortium describes Web3D as follows:\nWeb3D blends the intuitive human sense of space and time with user interface interaction and programming language integration producing a truly new and exciting technology for the Internet. The evolution of the Net from command-line to 2D graphical to emergent 3D interfaces reflects ongoing, fundamental progress toward human-centered interface design-that is, toward a more immersive and responsive computer-mediated experience. Open languages for programming and delivery Web3D include VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), Java3D, and X3D. VRML provides an interface that delivers virtual graphical three-dimensional worlds to users of Web browsers without consuming an exorbitant amount of bandwidth. VRML is based on an ASCII file format and three-dimensional modeling environments originally developed at Silicon Graphics. The key to VRML is that the descriptions of objects in the three-dimensional world (not the actual graphics) are transmitted to the user. This reduces the bandwidth requirements and makes virtual reality practical on the Web. Another key feature is scaling, which allows the user to move toward an object and watch that object grow in size. VRML provides information that describes an object, no matter what distance the viewer takes. Although VRML is a coding language, you won't need to do much coding to create virtual worlds. Instead, you create virtual worlds using tools that are essentially three-dimensional painting and modeling packages. VRML files have the extension .wrl (world) and their own MIME type.

Raising awareness, lobbying policies, and supporting local programs could help. Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people live that have a direct or indirect impact on their health and wellbeing. Homelessness is a significant problem in America, and homeless people experience multiple risks with regard to their health and quality of life. Addressing the needs of homeless people through tailored health and social services could help to improve the wellbeing of these populations. The present paper will outline the issue of homelessness as a social determinant of health in greater depth and examine the role that I could play to help my community. Homelessness is a significant determinant of health as it is connected with many issues that affect health. People who do not have a home often have problems with hygiene and face various environmental hazards contributing to their health problems, including cold temperatures and exposure to infections. According to the American Psychological Association (n.d.), homeless people have an increased rate of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and are at a higher risk of contracting HIV. Sexually transmitted infections are also prevalent in specific homeless populations (APA, n.d.). Infectious diseases have a negative impact on any person’s wellbeing and quality of life since they often have symptoms causing discomfort and pain. However, homeless people face more challenges with infections because they are often unable to obtain health care promptly. This may lead to life-threatening health conditions, as well as to chronic health problems, thus impacting the overall health of this population. In the context of homelessness and health, people often overlook the concerns associated with homeless people’s mental health. Psychological conditions have a crucial impact on homeless people’s overall wellbeing and their quality of life. Research shows that homeless populations have a higher prevalence of mental health problems. For example, almost half of homeless women meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is twice the level of prevalence in the general population (APA, n.d.). Homeless people also face the physical and mental health risks of drug addiction and substance use as these issues are widespread in the streets (APA, n.d.). It is also essential to note that many people become homeless while already having mental health problems, thus often losing access to psychological help they need. For instance, homelessness is rather prevalent among veterans and can coincide with posttraumatic stress disorder. One critical characteristic of homelessness as a social determinant of health is that it is connected to other determinants, including poverty, malnutrition, and poor access to care. The interconnectedness of these problems is the primary factor impacting the health of homeless people, meaning that solutions to address the impact of homelessness on health have to be systemic and include low-income housing, improved access to care, and employment support. My role in addressing the issue of homelessness in my community is raising awareness about the problem and solutions, advocating for the needs of homeless populations, and supporting policies and programs to remedy the issue. For instance, I could take part in changing this social determinant by contacting local policymakers and requesting improvements in low-income housing and healthcare in the area. I could also spread awareness about organizations providing services to homeless people in the area to ensure that people know where they can get help. These steps would help to improve the health of people who are homeless while also addressing homelessness in a broader socio-economic context. American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Health & homelessness. Web.\n\nDo you believe that your home can have an impact on your mental health? There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.\n\n“It’s important that we think about the continuing effects that this might have on some sub-populations, such as essential workers or racial ethnic minorities… [and] that we think through cultural and linguistically appropriate intervention.”\n‘Financial insecurity, housing challenges ... creating additional stressors’\nAside from health-related fears, financial insecurity is a major factor for mental health — particularly as the U.S. continues to experience elevated unemployment numbers and Americans remain dependent on government stimulus amid the pandemic-induced recession. “I will say anecdotally, we understand that given the COVID-19 pandemic, there are individuals who are experiencing financial insecurity, housing challenges that may be creating additional stressors,” Lane said. “Additionally, just thinking about ways in which to increase social support during a pandemic like COVID-19 is important to consider in the things that individuals are encountering that are impacting their mental health.”\nA psychological survey of 10,368 American adults conducted by the University of Arkansas specifically cited issues like fear about losing jobs, not being able to pay bills or afford food, and “the unique juxtaposition of extreme physical distancing, approaching geographical isolation, coupled with sustained isolation.”\nAlthough there is no one solution to fixing these mental health effects on Americans, Lane suggested regular screening for mental health, substance use, and suicide ideation. “This can be in the form of traditional treatment, but also thinking about expanding use of telehealth as an effective means for delivering treatment for mental health,” she said. “In general, expanding our mental health services in the United States is important.”\nAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

It begins psychologically in the way that we are using the word “stress” yet soon begins to manifest physically in the body as well. It usually arises when the individual’s various resources – physical, emotional, biological, material, etc. – are not adequate to meet the demands placed by a situation. The Main Causes of Stress\nA whole lot of situations can give rise to stress:\n- Being hard-pressed for time to meet a deadline at work\n- Financial problems\n- Health problems\n- Having to handle too much workload at workplace plus home\n- Loss of a near and dear one and countless other situations. Stress is everywhere and affects everyone – you can be stressed out while doing your darnedest to meet a deadline, or when you’re stuck in a traffic pile-up, or when there’s a fight in the family, or when a student flunks his exams, or when your financial condition is bad and bill payments are pending – such stressful situations encountered in daily life are countless. In fact, stress has become an inevitable part of modern life. The survival factor\nOur fast-paced world is all about the survival of the fittest – you have the resources, you survive; if you don’t, you pay the price. So, any situation that depletes personal resources or threatens them or snatches them away will cause stress to build up. The emotional factor\nAll people respond to situations in an emotional manner. A combination of emotions can lead to stress, depending on how a person can keep his feelings under check and how practical his approach to life is. The lifestyle factor\nToday’s lifestyles are nerve-wracking – commuting problems, terrorism, depression, pink slips, demanding bosses, overwork, fatigue, deadlines, credit, competition, ambitious colleagues, junk food, etc., all combine to raise the stress levels. The health factor\nIf a person keeps poor health or is affected by a threatening medical condition – then such factors can lead to stress. Illness of near and dear ones can also lead to stress. The environmental factor\nTake a look around you and you will find we are living in a noisy, polluted world that’s getting warmer by the day. This too contributes to stress. Types of Stress\nYou have already grasped what stress is all about, and now you need to know how stress affects you. Before we get to the effects of stress, you need to differentiate between two types of stress – good stress and bad stress. Good stress is something that is born out of a feeling of competitiveness – many people try to excel at their professions and they want to be the best in their field. This can happen before an interview, a deadline, a sporting event, etc. Such stress motivates an individual, gives him a sense of purpose, and brings about a happy and positive outcome. However, people must take care to ensure that this good stress occurs in small bouts and doesn’t get stretched. When people get stressed (even though it may be good stress) all the time then such stress can be termed as bad stress. However, that is too narrow a definition for bad stress – bad stress is everything that good stress isn’t – it is long-lived and brought in by negative feelings caused by emotional conflicts or health conditions or negative thoughts or fights or boredom or academics, or a combination of various factors. The outcome of bad stress is negative. Effects of Stress\nStress is the body’s response to a situation. When people are stressed, the body releases energy-boosting chemicals into the blood to fight off stress. These chemicals adrenalize the person and he reacts to the situation – if the situation is defused and the energy is spent positively, then stress does not cause any problems. However, if the energy-boosting chemicals remain in the bloodstream and do not find an outlet, then that is bad news. Such bad stress can affect both mind and body – it can cause health (physical and mental) problems, emotional trauma, conflicts, fatigue and various other negative effects. Facts about Stress\n- Stress is universal. It affects people in large numbers across the world, and it spares no one – man, woman or child. - According to statistics, 75% of Americans experience stress minimum twice in a month. - Stress can cause or aggravate existing medical conditions.\n\nStress and your health\nStress can cause physical changes that may set us up for illness and contribute to serious health problems, including heart disease. Whether we worry about money, work, health problems or Wall Street meltdowns, stress can be a serious problem in our lives—and not just because it batters emotions. Research shows that stress can affect our bodies and contribute to health problems, including headaches, depression and heart disease. The kind of stress that's particularly bad for us is long-term stress, as well as uncontrollable stress, according to the American Psychological Association. Stress and your health\nThe symptoms of stress are actually your body's way of responding to a threat. Hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, are released into the blood, causing heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar to rise. Known as the fight-or-flight response, these and other stress-induced changes may help prepare our bodies to address a challenge. While a reasonable amount of stress can keep us on our toes and help with daily challenges, too much stress may harm our health. Our bodies are ready to fight or run too often. Too much stress can make sleeping difficult and may contribute to headaches and neck, back and muscle aches. Stress can also make diseases such as asthma worse, slow down wound healing and contribute to depression. And, if you cope with stress by eating more, you could end up gaining unwanted weight. In addition, research suggests a link between stress and the following health concerns:\nGastrointestinal problems, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While researchers don't yet know what causes IBS, stress can trigger symptoms, including diarrhea and constipation. Even in people who don't have IBS, problems such as diarrhea and constipation can occur in times of stress. Lowered immunity. Chronic stress may wear on the immune system, opening the door to the common cold or other viral or bacterial infections. Heart disease. Temporary, high levels of stress can trigger heart attacks in people with underlying heart problems, according to the American Medical Association. Research is also looking at links between chronic stress and heart disease, including the possibility that stress hormones directly damage the vascular system or the heart. Stress may also influence heart disease risk factors or trigger unhealthy behaviors, the American Heart Association reports. For example, people under stress may eat unhealthy foods, drink excessive alcohol, overeat, exercise less or smoke. Stress is also implicated in the accumulation of abdominal fat, a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Diabetes. Stress hormones can increase glucose levels, and some research suggests that long-term stress may contribute to the development of diabetes in some people. Also, people who have diabetes may find it harder to control their blood sugar when they're stressed, according to the American Diabetes Association. Cancer. Studies have reached conflicting conclusions, though some evidence suggests that stress may weaken the body's defense against certain cancers or cause unhealthy behaviors that increase cancer risk, according to the National Cancer Institute. Stress is unavoidable, but that doesn't mean we can't manage it. The first step is to recognize problem stress, which affects everyone differently. For some people, warning signs are headaches or an upset stomach. Other signs may be being irritable, sleepy or fatigued. Techniques for coping include changing how you handle stressful situations, exercising and committing even 15 minutes a day to quietly relax.

This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.\n\nHow Housing Quality Affects Child Mental Health\nby Will Schupmann\nHomes are where people expect to be safe, comfortable, and healthy. But this is not the case for millions of children who are at risk of poor health outcomes because of problems with housing quality, housing instability, and unaffordability. Although more than a century of observation and research have documented how household triggers affect children’s physical health, poor housing can be equally destructive to their emotional, psychological, and behavioral health and development. Because so many critical developmental periods are concentrated in early childhood, young children may be most at risk, although research finds connections between housing and mental health during other periods of life as well. As researchers strive to understand the reasons for these complex psychological effects, policymakers, housing developers, advocates, and funders should note that housing quality lays the foundation for children’s mental health. What connections have researchers found between child mental health and housing quality? Whether in a city with concentrated poverty or in a rural community, studies have tracked children’s housing environments, psychological health, and development over time, finding connections for children of all ages. Using data on children ranging widely in age, a team of child development researchers found that children from low-income households living in concentrated poverty were more developmentally harmed by poor housing quality than by residential instability, unaffordability, or other housing factors. Children who lived with leaking roofs, exposed wires, pest infestation, and other problems were more likely to exhibit emotional and behavioral problems, which manifested themselves through anxiety, depression, and other internalizations in some children, and more outwardly aggressive behaviors and rule breaking in others. By adolescence, poor-quality housing was associated with lower reading and math scores on standardized tests. Another study, which tracked children in rural areas beginning at age 9, found after 15 years that poor housing conditions—including physical quality, home hazards, crowding, and clutter—were associated with worse psychological health immediately and over time. Similar to the study above, kids expressed poor psychological health in both internal and external ways. Housing quality deficiencies were also associated with feelings of helplessness over the short term. Why do homes affect children’s mental well-being? The path from a physical hazard to a physical harm is straightforward, but what’s behind the association between poor housing quality and poor child mental health? In part, maternal psychological distress. Researchers have found that poor-quality housing may create stress for parents, increase their own mental health problems, and limit their ability to regulate family activities. A policy research brief on the topic clearly states how housing problems can convert a home from a safe haven to a mental hazard: “Thus, rather than being a source of security and escape from life’s pressures, a home with quality deficiencies may add to other stresses experienced by poor families, leading to a cumulative negative impact on well-being.”\nPoor living conditions can also prevent children from engaging in playful and social activities, which are beneficial to their cognitive, social, and emotional well-being. Cramped or unsafe environments restrict children from exploring, interacting with, and learning from the world around them. As one researcher writes, “play helps children develop new competencies that lead to enhanced confidence and the resiliency they will need to face future challenges.”\nWhat are the broader impacts and societal costs of poor housing quality? Having thousands of children living in poor-quality homes leads to detrimental effects for society. When housing problems exacerbate children’s depressive or aggressive behavior, it can affect their peers, contribute to teacher burnout, reduce school performance ratings, and lead to behavior-based calls that pull parents out of work and hinder productivity. And that’s just in the short term. Evidence shows that psychological problems experienced during childhood can reduce adult earnings (by one-fourth by age 50) and decrease one’s chances of establishing long-term, stable relationships. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and aggression in children can lead to lifelong mental illness, and the economic burden of mental illness is large: the World Health Organization estimated that by 2030, the global cost of mental illness will be over $6 trillion. Poor housing quality is thus a collective problem. Ensuring adequate housing conditions supports children’s healthy development, helps their schools and classrooms succeed, strengthens the economy, and reduces current and future health care costs.\n\nStress and Illness\nThis is Sarah Long. And this is Steve Ember with SCIENCE IN THE NEWS, a VOA Special English program about recent developments in science. Stress is a condition of mental or emotional tension. Today, we tell about the effects of stress on people’s health. Many people suffered mental and emotional problems after the September Eleventh terrorist attacks in the United States last year. Terrorism creates fear and fear often leads to severe stress. Studies suggest that stress can reduce the body’s ability to fight disease and can lead to serious health problems. Stress affects everybody every day. It is your body’s reaction to physical, chemical, emotional or environmental influences. Some stress is unavoidable and may even be good for us. Stress can keep our bodies and minds strong. It gives us the push we need to react to an urgent situation. Some people say it makes them more productive at work and gives them more energy. Too much stress, however, can be harmful. It may make an existing health problem worse. Or it can lead to illness if a person is at risk for the condition. For example, your body reacts to stressful situations by raising your blood pressure and making your heart work harder. This is especially dangerous is you already have heart or artery disease or high blood pressure. Stress is more likely to be harmful if you feel helpless to deal with the problem or situation that causes the stress. Anything you see as a problem can cause stress. It can be caused by everyday situations or by major problems. Stress results when something causes your body to act as if it were under attack. Sources of stress can be physical, such as injury or illness. Or they can be mental, such as problems with your family, job, health or finances. Many visits to doctors are for conditions related to stress. The tension of stress can interfere with sleep or cause uncontrollable anger or sadness. A person may become more forgetful or find it harder to concentrate. Losing one’s sense of humor is another sign of an unhealthy amount of stress. Stress can lead to many other health problems if people try to ease it by smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, or by eating more or less than normal. Chronic stress lasts a long time or happens often. Chronic stress causes the body to produce too much of the hormones cortisol and adrenalin. Cortisol is called the “worry” hormone. It is produced when we are afraid. Adrenalin is known as the “fight or flight” hormone. It prepares the body to react physically to a threat. People under chronic stress produce too much of these hormones for too long. Too much cortisol and adrenalin can result in physical problems and even changes that lead to stress-related illnesses. Cortisol provides high levels of energy during important periods. However, scientists have become concerned about the hormone’s long-term effects on our health. Evidence shows that extended periods of cortisol in the body weakens bones, damages nerve cells in the brain and weakens the body’s defense system against disease. This makes it easier to get viral and bacterial infections. Chronic stress has been linked to high blood pressure and heart disease. Research suggests that people who are easily stressed develop blockages in their arteries faster than other people who are more calm. A recent study of women was carried out in Japan. It found that women who reported high levels of stress were more than two times as likely to die from stroke and heart disease as other women. High stress levels have been found to cause asthma attacks that make it difficult to breathe. Stress is also linked to mental conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Research also shows that chronic stress reduces the levels of the hormone estrogen in women. This might put some women at greater risk for heart disease or the bone-thinning disease, osteoporosis. Experts say long-term stress also can weaken your resistance to infections such as colds and influenza, as well as your ability to recover from these diseases. Extended periods of stress are also linked to headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomach problems and skin problems. Mental and health experts believe personality is an important part in how we experience stress. Personality is the way a person acts, feels and thinks. Many things influence the development of a person’s personality, including genetics and experience. Some people, for example, are aggressive and always in a hurry. They often become angry when things do not happen the way they planned. They are called “Type A” personalities. Studies suggest that these people often get stress-related illnesses.\n\nThis is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS in VOA Special\nEnglish. I'm Barbara Klein. I'm Bob Doughty.

Raising awareness, lobbying policies, and supporting local programs could help. Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people live that have a direct or indirect impact on their health and wellbeing. Homelessness is a significant problem in America, and homeless people experience multiple risks with regard to their health and quality of life. Addressing the needs of homeless people through tailored health and social services could help to improve the wellbeing of these populations. The present paper will outline the issue of homelessness as a social determinant of health in greater depth and examine the role that I could play to help my community. Homelessness is a significant determinant of health as it is connected with many issues that affect health. People who do not have a home often have problems with hygiene and face various environmental hazards contributing to their health problems, including cold temperatures and exposure to infections. According to the American Psychological Association (n.d.), homeless people have an increased rate of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and are at a higher risk of contracting HIV. Sexually transmitted infections are also prevalent in specific homeless populations (APA, n.d.). Infectious diseases have a negative impact on any person’s wellbeing and quality of life since they often have symptoms causing discomfort and pain. However, homeless people face more challenges with infections because they are often unable to obtain health care promptly. This may lead to life-threatening health conditions, as well as to chronic health problems, thus impacting the overall health of this population. In the context of homelessness and health, people often overlook the concerns associated with homeless people’s mental health. Psychological conditions have a crucial impact on homeless people’s overall wellbeing and their quality of life. Research shows that homeless populations have a higher prevalence of mental health problems. For example, almost half of homeless women meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is twice the level of prevalence in the general population (APA, n.d.). Homeless people also face the physical and mental health risks of drug addiction and substance use as these issues are widespread in the streets (APA, n.d.). It is also essential to note that many people become homeless while already having mental health problems, thus often losing access to psychological help they need. For instance, homelessness is rather prevalent among veterans and can coincide with posttraumatic stress disorder. One critical characteristic of homelessness as a social determinant of health is that it is connected to other determinants, including poverty, malnutrition, and poor access to care. The interconnectedness of these problems is the primary factor impacting the health of homeless people, meaning that solutions to address the impact of homelessness on health have to be systemic and include low-income housing, improved access to care, and employment support. My role in addressing the issue of homelessness in my community is raising awareness about the problem and solutions, advocating for the needs of homeless populations, and supporting policies and programs to remedy the issue. For instance, I could take part in changing this social determinant by contacting local policymakers and requesting improvements in low-income housing and healthcare in the area. I could also spread awareness about organizations providing services to homeless people in the area to ensure that people know where they can get help. These steps would help to improve the health of people who are homeless while also addressing homelessness in a broader socio-economic context. American Psychological Association. (n.d.).

There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:068fded4-f2d5-48b6-9bd7-65181a9f5a05>"]},{"passage":"“It’s important that we think about the continuing effects that this might have on some sub-populations, such as essential workers or racial ethnic minorities… [and] that we think through cultural and linguistically appropriate intervention.”\n‘Financial insecurity, housing challenges ... creating additional stressors’\nAside from health-related fears, financial insecurity is a major factor for mental health — particularly as the U.S. continues to experience elevated unemployment numbers and Americans remain dependent on government stimulus amid the pandemic-induced recession. “I will say anecdotally, we understand that given the COVID-19 pandemic, there are individuals who are experiencing financial insecurity, housing challenges that may be creating additional stressors,” Lane said. “Additionally, just thinking about ways in which to increase social support during a pandemic like COVID-19 is important to consider in the things that individuals are encountering that are impacting their mental health.”\nA psychological survey of 10,368 American adults conducted by the University of Arkansas specifically cited issues like fear about losing jobs, not being able to pay bills or afford food, and “the unique juxtaposition of extreme physical distancing, approaching geographical isolation, coupled with sustained isolation.”\nAlthough there is no one solution to fixing these mental health effects on Americans, Lane suggested regular screening for mental health, substance use, and suicide ideation. “This can be in the form of traditional treatment, but also thinking about expanding use of telehealth as an effective means for delivering treatment for mental health,” she said. “In general, expanding our mental health services in the United States is important.”\nAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

It begins psychologically in the way that we are using the word “stress” yet soon begins to manifest physically in the body as well. It usually arises when the individual’s various resources – physical, emotional, biological, material, etc. – are not adequate to meet the demands placed by a situation. The Main Causes of Stress\nA whole lot of situations can give rise to stress:\n- Being hard-pressed for time to meet a deadline at work\n- Financial problems\n- Health problems\n- Having to handle too much workload at workplace plus home\n- Loss of a near and dear one and countless other situations. Stress is everywhere and affects everyone – you can be stressed out while doing your darnedest to meet a deadline, or when you’re stuck in a traffic pile-up, or when there’s a fight in the family, or when a student flunks his exams, or when your financial condition is bad and bill payments are pending – such stressful situations encountered in daily life are countless. In fact, stress has become an inevitable part of modern life. The survival factor\nOur fast-paced world is all about the survival of the fittest – you have the resources, you survive; if you don’t, you pay the price. So, any situation that depletes personal resources or threatens them or snatches them away will cause stress to build up. The emotional factor\nAll people respond to situations in an emotional manner. A combination of emotions can lead to stress, depending on how a person can keep his feelings under check and how practical his approach to life is. The lifestyle factor\nToday’s lifestyles are nerve-wracking – commuting problems, terrorism, depression, pink slips, demanding bosses, overwork, fatigue, deadlines, credit, competition, ambitious colleagues, junk food, etc., all combine to raise the stress levels. The health factor\nIf a person keeps poor health or is affected by a threatening medical condition – then such factors can lead to stress. Illness of near and dear ones can also lead to stress. The environmental factor\nTake a look around you and you will find we are living in a noisy, polluted world that’s getting warmer by the day. This too contributes to stress. Types of Stress\nYou have already grasped what stress is all about, and now you need to know how stress affects you. Before we get to the effects of stress, you need to differentiate between two types of stress – good stress and bad stress. Good stress is something that is born out of a feeling of competitiveness – many people try to excel at their professions and they want to be the best in their field. This can happen before an interview, a deadline, a sporting event, etc. Such stress motivates an individual, gives him a sense of purpose, and brings about a happy and positive outcome. However, people must take care to ensure that this good stress occurs in small bouts and doesn’t get stretched. When people get stressed (even though it may be good stress) all the time then such stress can be termed as bad stress. However, that is too narrow a definition for bad stress – bad stress is everything that good stress isn’t – it is long-lived and brought in by negative feelings caused by emotional conflicts or health conditions or negative thoughts or fights or boredom or academics, or a combination of various factors. The outcome of bad stress is negative. Effects of Stress\nStress is the body’s response to a situation. When people are stressed, the body releases energy-boosting chemicals into the blood to fight off stress. These chemicals adrenalize the person and he reacts to the situation – if the situation is defused and the energy is spent positively, then stress does not cause any problems. However, if the energy-boosting chemicals remain in the bloodstream and do not find an outlet, then that is bad news. Such bad stress can affect both mind and body – it can cause health (physical and mental) problems, emotional trauma, conflicts, fatigue and various other negative effects. Facts about Stress\n- Stress is universal. It affects people in large numbers across the world, and it spares no one – man, woman or child. - According to statistics, 75% of Americans experience stress minimum twice in a month. - Stress can cause or aggravate existing medical conditions.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c5f64a32-f70c-4bfc-ba43-dcb341ab5c09>"]},{"passage":"Stress and your health\nStress can cause physical changes that may set us up for illness and contribute to serious health problems, including heart disease. Whether we worry about money, work, health problems or Wall Street meltdowns, stress can be a serious problem in our lives—and not just because it batters emotions. Research shows that stress can affect our bodies and contribute to health problems, including headaches, depression and heart disease. The kind of stress that's particularly bad for us is long-term stress, as well as uncontrollable stress, according to the American Psychological Association. Stress and your health\nThe symptoms of stress are actually your body's way of responding to a threat. Hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, are released into the blood, causing heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar to rise. Known as the fight-or-flight response, these and other stress-induced changes may help prepare our bodies to address a challenge. While a reasonable amount of stress can keep us on our toes and help with daily challenges, too much stress may harm our health. Our bodies are ready to fight or run too often. Too much stress can make sleeping difficult and may contribute to headaches and neck, back and muscle aches. Stress can also make diseases such as asthma worse, slow down wound healing and contribute to depression. And, if you cope with stress by eating more, you could end up gaining unwanted weight. In addition, research suggests a link between stress and the following health concerns:\nGastrointestinal problems, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While researchers don't yet know what causes IBS, stress can trigger symptoms, including diarrhea and constipation. Even in people who don't have IBS, problems such as diarrhea and constipation can occur in times of stress. Lowered immunity. Chronic stress may wear on the immune system, opening the door to the common cold or other viral or bacterial infections. Heart disease. Temporary, high levels of stress can trigger heart attacks in people with underlying heart problems, according to the American Medical Association. Research is also looking at links between chronic stress and heart disease, including the possibility that stress hormones directly damage the vascular system or the heart. Stress may also influence heart disease risk factors or trigger unhealthy behaviors, the American Heart Association reports. For example, people under stress may eat unhealthy foods, drink excessive alcohol, overeat, exercise less or smoke. Stress is also implicated in the accumulation of abdominal fat, a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Diabetes. Stress hormones can increase glucose levels, and some research suggests that long-term stress may contribute to the development of diabetes in some people. Also, people who have diabetes may find it harder to control their blood sugar when they're stressed, according to the American Diabetes Association. Cancer. Studies have reached conflicting conclusions, though some evidence suggests that stress may weaken the body's defense against certain cancers or cause unhealthy behaviors that increase cancer risk, according to the National Cancer Institute. Stress is unavoidable, but that doesn't mean we can't manage it. The first step is to recognize problem stress, which affects everyone differently. For some people, warning signs are headaches or an upset stomach. Other signs may be being irritable, sleepy or fatigued. Techniques for coping include changing how you handle stressful situations, exercising and committing even 15 minutes a day to quietly relax.

This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small.

But this is not the case for millions of children who are at risk of poor health outcomes because of problems with housing quality, housing instability, and unaffordability. Although more than a century of observation and research have documented how household triggers affect children’s physical health, poor housing can be equally destructive to their emotional, psychological, and behavioral health and development. Because so many critical developmental periods are concentrated in early childhood, young children may be most at risk, although research finds connections between housing and mental health during other periods of life as well. As researchers strive to understand the reasons for these complex psychological effects, policymakers, housing developers, advocates, and funders should note that housing quality lays the foundation for children’s mental health. What connections have researchers found between child mental health and housing quality? Whether in a city with concentrated poverty or in a rural community, studies have tracked children’s housing environments, psychological health, and development over time, finding connections for children of all ages. Using data on children ranging widely in age, a team of child development researchers found that children from low-income households living in concentrated poverty were more developmentally harmed by poor housing quality than by residential instability, unaffordability, or other housing factors. Children who lived with leaking roofs, exposed wires, pest infestation, and other problems were more likely to exhibit emotional and behavioral problems, which manifested themselves through anxiety, depression, and other internalizations in some children, and more outwardly aggressive behaviors and rule breaking in others. By adolescence, poor-quality housing was associated with lower reading and math scores on standardized tests. Another study, which tracked children in rural areas beginning at age 9, found after 15 years that poor housing conditions—including physical quality, home hazards, crowding, and clutter—were associated with worse psychological health immediately and over time. Similar to the study above, kids expressed poor psychological health in both internal and external ways. Housing quality deficiencies were also associated with feelings of helplessness over the short term. Why do homes affect children’s mental well-being? The path from a physical hazard to a physical harm is straightforward, but what’s behind the association between poor housing quality and poor child mental health? In part, maternal psychological distress. Researchers have found that poor-quality housing may create stress for parents, increase their own mental health problems, and limit their ability to regulate family activities. A policy research brief on the topic clearly states how housing problems can convert a home from a safe haven to a mental hazard: “Thus, rather than being a source of security and escape from life’s pressures, a home with quality deficiencies may add to other stresses experienced by poor families, leading to a cumulative negative impact on well-being.”\nPoor living conditions can also prevent children from engaging in playful and social activities, which are beneficial to their cognitive, social, and emotional well-being. Cramped or unsafe environments restrict children from exploring, interacting with, and learning from the world around them. As one researcher writes, “play helps children develop new competencies that lead to enhanced confidence and the resiliency they will need to face future challenges.”\nWhat are the broader impacts and societal costs of poor housing quality? Having thousands of children living in poor-quality homes leads to detrimental effects for society. When housing problems exacerbate children’s depressive or aggressive behavior, it can affect their peers, contribute to teacher burnout, reduce school performance ratings, and lead to behavior-based calls that pull parents out of work and hinder productivity. And that’s just in the short term. Evidence shows that psychological problems experienced during childhood can reduce adult earnings (by one-fourth by age 50) and decrease one’s chances of establishing long-term, stable relationships. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and aggression in children can lead to lifelong mental illness, and the economic burden of mental illness is large: the World Health Organization estimated that by 2030, the global cost of mental illness will be over $6 trillion. Poor housing quality is thus a collective problem. Ensuring adequate housing conditions supports children’s healthy development, helps their schools and classrooms succeed, strengthens the economy, and reduces current and future health care costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c5857c0f-714a-43e7-b500-9adade918495>"]},{"passage":"Stress and Illness\nThis is Sarah Long. And this is Steve Ember with SCIENCE IN THE NEWS, a VOA Special English program about recent developments in science. Stress is a condition of mental or emotional tension. Today, we tell about the effects of stress on people’s health. Many people suffered mental and emotional problems after the September Eleventh terrorist attacks in the United States last year. Terrorism creates fear and fear often leads to severe stress. Studies suggest that stress can reduce the body’s ability to fight disease and can lead to serious health problems. Stress affects everybody every day. It is your body’s reaction to physical, chemical, emotional or environmental influences. Some stress is unavoidable and may even be good for us. Stress can keep our bodies and minds strong. It gives us the push we need to react to an urgent situation. Some people say it makes them more productive at work and gives them more energy. Too much stress, however, can be harmful. It may make an existing health problem worse. Or it can lead to illness if a person is at risk for the condition. For example, your body reacts to stressful situations by raising your blood pressure and making your heart work harder. This is especially dangerous is you already have heart or artery disease or high blood pressure. Stress is more likely to be harmful if you feel helpless to deal with the problem or situation that causes the stress. Anything you see as a problem can cause stress. It can be caused by everyday situations or by major problems. Stress results when something causes your body to act as if it were under attack. Sources of stress can be physical, such as injury or illness. Or they can be mental, such as problems with your family, job, health or finances. Many visits to doctors are for conditions related to stress. The tension of stress can interfere with sleep or cause uncontrollable anger or sadness. A person may become more forgetful or find it harder to concentrate. Losing one’s sense of humor is another sign of an unhealthy amount of stress. Stress can lead to many other health problems if people try to ease it by smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs, or by eating more or less than normal. Chronic stress lasts a long time or happens often. Chronic stress causes the body to produce too much of the hormones cortisol and adrenalin. Cortisol is called the “worry” hormone. It is produced when we are afraid. Adrenalin is known as the “fight or flight” hormone. It prepares the body to react physically to a threat. People under chronic stress produce too much of these hormones for too long. Too much cortisol and adrenalin can result in physical problems and even changes that lead to stress-related illnesses. Cortisol provides high levels of energy during important periods. However, scientists have become concerned about the hormone’s long-term effects on our health. Evidence shows that extended periods of cortisol in the body weakens bones, damages nerve cells in the brain and weakens the body’s defense system against disease. This makes it easier to get viral and bacterial infections. Chronic stress has been linked to high blood pressure and heart disease. Research suggests that people who are easily stressed develop blockages in their arteries faster than other people who are more calm. A recent study of women was carried out in Japan. It found that women who reported high levels of stress were more than two times as likely to die from stroke and heart disease as other women. High stress levels have been found to cause asthma attacks that make it difficult to breathe. Stress is also linked to mental conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Research also shows that chronic stress reduces the levels of the hormone estrogen in women. This might put some women at greater risk for heart disease or the bone-thinning disease, osteoporosis. Experts say long-term stress also can weaken your resistance to infections such as colds and influenza, as well as your ability to recover from these diseases. Extended periods of stress are also linked to headaches, difficulty sleeping, stomach problems and skin problems. Mental and health experts believe personality is an important part in how we experience stress. Personality is the way a person acts, feels and thinks. Many things influence the development of a person’s personality, including genetics and experience. Some people, for example, are aggressive and always in a hurry. They often become angry when things do not happen the way they planned. They are called “Type A” personalities. Studies suggest that these people often get stress-related illnesses.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7217e005-bef7-403b-abdd-07503075bc65>"]},{"passage":"This is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS in VOA Special\nEnglish.

It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House. This article comes from the October\/November issue of ADDitude. SUBSCRIBE TODAY to ensure you don't miss a single issue.\n\nBefore you attend your first appointment\/assessment, have a think about your child’s developmental history and complete the Child History Questionnaire (CHQ). Some of the questions you will be asked in the assessment would be:\nIf your child has attended an assessment or therapy elsewhere (another speech and language therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, etc), it would be useful for you to bring reports or share the information from such sessions with your speech and language therapist also. Speech is the ability to use your lips, tongue and other parts of your mouth to produce sounds. To produce clear speech children need to be able to produce the different sounds of speech, as well as understand the rules for putting those sounds together in their language. Most children have mastered the following sounds by the following ages:\nMost children make mistakes in their speech during the first few years of speech development. But by about three years, most children can be understood by their main caregivers. If you’re worried that your child might have a speech disorder, think about how often people who don’t know your child have trouble understanding your child. It’s best to consider seeking help if your child:\nNo. There are some common myths about multilingual development. It is been said to many parents that multilingualism will cause children to develop language at a slower pace. But there is no scientific evidence to support that belief. Many children around the world learn more than one language at the same time and don’t show language delays. A social conversation requires many areas, all of which we are supporting your child in developing. These areas are not limiting but include, vocabulary, concepts, memory, organizing, sequencing skills, to support your child in being able to have a conversation. Yes, all the information pertaining to the case is deemed highly confidential to respect individual privacy and for strictly upholding the ethical standards on which our psychologists function. Only after written consent from the parent\/client can a professional share the information with another specialist if needed. More information can be found regarding this on our consent forms for psychological therapy and assessment. With children, you should ensure familiarity to the process and environment. You can help your child understand what to expect during therapy\/assessment with social stories. You may also introduce your child to his\/her psychologist, here. During the consult session, you may ask your child’s psychologist for more assistance on how to help your child feel less anxious. With teenagers, you should introduce the topic of seeing a psychologist in a gentle manner, when both you and your child are calm. Express your concerns clearly in an open and loving way, and let your child know you want him to be happier, healthier, more productive, and less sad or anxious. Avoid approaching your child with accusations, lectures and angry or disappointed reactions. This leaves them feeling ashamed and would be more reluctant to see a therapist. Also avoid broaching the topic right after an argument. Seeing a psychologist should not be seen as a punishment or threat to ensure compliance. Many teens resist therapy because they may feel there is a taboo to it, or that their friends will find out and believe there is something ‘wrong’ with them. During the consult session, you may speak to the psychologist to find out more about the client-therapist confidentiality and limits; and how to communicate these to your teenager. You may also ask the psychologist for more assistance on how to help your child feel less anxious. Adequately preparing your child for an assessment can reduce anxiety and encourage cooperation through the upcoming battery of tests. Prior to the assessment:\nFor young children:\nFor school-aged children:\nThe night before the assessment:\nOn the day of the assessment:\nDecades of research indicate that the provision of therapy is an interpersonal process in which a main curative component is the nature of the therapeutic relationship. Comparative studies of psychotherapy consistently report that measures of therapeutic relationship correlate more highly with client outcome than specialised therapy techniques. Some therapists are better than others at contributing to positive client outcome. Such therapists are more understanding and accepting, empathic, warm, and supportive. They engage in fewer negative behaviours such as blaming, ignoring, or rejecting.\n\nFor that reason, they often make an oppositional youngster uncomfortable. The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.\n\nYou have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation.\n\nTreatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.\n\nThis story is a total rip-off. The New York Times recently featured a worthwhile piece entitled, A Doctor’s Guide to a Good Appointment. In that vein, I couldn’t help but add my two cents worth of advice about how to make the best of a family’s first visit to a developmental specialist\nFinding a functional medicine specialist. The opinion of a pediatric neurologist is a good start. But, time is of the essence and evaluations that involve months of waiting serve the patient poorly, because they represent needless delay. A trusted pediatrician can be a great help. Therapists’ views are important because they are independent observers who know the child more intimatel. However, if you still can’t put your finger on what’s wrong, and if you find that you have been going to a variety of specialists (e.g. GI, allergy, dermatologist. pulmonologist), maybe it is time to seek a modern medical viewpoint. When possible, ask other parents about their research and experience, but don’t forget that every child is unique, so this merely represents one piece of the puzzle. The most reliable web advice is to be found at the Medical Academy of Pediatric Special Needs clinician directory. Before your visit:\nLabs, X-rays, MRI’s, EEG’s, IEP’s, psychological reports, hospital records, and evaluations of all types are extremely helpful. It is understandable, however, that some parents may prefer a completely fresh, unbiased opinion, perhaps saving that data for a future visit. At The Child Development Center, we find videos extremely valuable. Taking the time to produce a written history with your specific concerns often yields the most satisfying consultation. On the day of:\nIt may be difficult to appreciate the anxiety that all family members experience in this situation, including the child. Another stranger. More tests. Overcoming fear may require social stories, bribery, a favorite food, electronic devices, or some other tested method. Either a picture, list, or a bag of the present medications and supplements, streamlines the visit. Plus, any archive of past meds – what worked and what didn’t – can similarly improve the efficiency of the interview. Perhaps it goes without saying, but be sure to bring along any familiar toys, blankets, etc., so that the doctor is able to observe the children and the parents can focus on the conversation. Whenever possible, a close family member or therapist will be a valuable addition to the team. An open discussion with the practitioner is imperative. Even the tension caused by a family’s disagreement about whether there really is a problem, is important in making an accurate assessment and creating a useful treatment plan. Back at Home:\nPerhaps this is the most difficult part. Who should you believe? Have any of the previous treatments been particularly successful? Has the child reached some plateau where he\/she seems stuck? What are the alternatives? Listen to your heart. Having reached some degree of non-conventional intervention, there may be a desire to further micromanage. Can 2 functional medicine doctors perform better than one? Although parents who attempt this course may be correct, a mixture of protocols could delay improvement. Get started with one intervention at a time, and become comfortable that nothing is causing harm. Be clear about what skills you are targeting and document progress. Not infrequently, the treatment can involve periods of increased aggression or even regression, due to the ‘die-off’ of harmful organisms, food restriction, arduous therapy sessions, even new-found skills and sensory overload. Close contact with the practitioner (via email, phone, follow-up visits) is a must at this juncture, if the treatment plan is to be followed and successfully implemented. All of the points in the ‘real’ Times article are well-taken and valuable in this instance, as well. Hopefully, this advice will serve to make the experience of taking the next step in your child’s journey even more productive.\n\nA CYC can help by identifying and providing a suitably in-depth assessment of individual children and adolescents, as well as, designing, implementing and evaluating interventions to assist students (and families if necessary) in dealing with specific school-related issues. In addition to this, we can help by developing programs in response to student request or assessed need with both \"normal\" and \"special needs\" students in order to promote the integration of special needs and normal\nThis may be for a short period of time or until they are an adult. It stands a challenge for professionals and a commitment is required when planning to meet positive outcomes for the child. For this type of research, obtaining different results from a multiple-choice questionnaire, face-to-face interviews and surveys for all the children will provide data to support children retaining their identity and establishing positive contact with adults and professionals. To illustrate, collecting all this data at the earliest possible stage, will enable vulnerable children to participate in relevant interventions like therapy sessions, CAMHS etc. In addition, using longitudinal studies follows the young person’s life through a 3-10 months’ time frame and allows the researcher to experience their participation in the care system. Access to other parents with students involved in special education could provide parents with a network of support. Cross-cultural communication strategies such as Skilled Dialogue would provide professionals and parents a guide to ensure the parents can establish goals for their\nSpeech and language therapist – These types of professionals support children and young people who have speech\/communication difficulties. They can work in a variety of community settings such as nurseries and children’s centres. They also provide training to support practitioners so they are able to develop a child’s speech and language skills within the school setting. They also work in partnership with parents to help the child develop their communication skills to the best of their ability and reach their full potential, they do this so that all children are able to develop within the education environment and also have an increased development socially. Accommodations a child may need to be successfully included in a childcare program; When teaching… Present information through demonstration instead of just verbal instruction; use both Written words provide visual cues Signs along with spoken word When communication verbally… Short sentences while communicating verbally Breaking instructions down into small “chunks” so they understand Patience while the child is speaking; allow them so speak slowly Ask parents for help ways they can help there children develop Language & speech therapists are also a useful resource if the child has been referred to one *children with Down syndrome have trouble communicating.

Children and adolescents\nWe know that growing up can be hard sometimes. It can be helpful to talk to someone outside of your family if something is getting in the way of you enjoying life to the full. You might have been experiencing difficulties such as:\n- Low self-esteem\n- Low mood or feeling unhappy\n- Getting worried, panicky or anxious\n- Having problems in your family\n- Living with a health condition\n- Having to do something in a certain way or a certain number of times to make it feel okay\nIt would be helpful for one of us to initially meet with you to understand the difficulties you are facing. We would explore how it affects you at home, at school, with your friends and think about how they can best help you. It would also be helpful to meet one of your parents or guardians, and you could bring a friend if that would help you feel more comfortable. Together we would decide if it is best to work with you individually or if working with you and your parent\/guardian would be better. It is possible for one of our Psychologists to meet individually with a young person as well as meeting individually with a parent; this can often be a helpful way to work. We understand that life can be challenging in a variety of different ways. Sometimes people need space to be heard and supported to understand and work through the difficulties they face. We hope that through this work, using a variety of models tailored to fit your needs, we can support you to maximise your strengths and resilience. We can work therapeutically with a range of difficulties including:\n- Low mood\n- Low self-esteem\n- Work stress\n- Health problems\n- Relationship issues\n- Overcoming traumatic events\n- Grief and loss\nWe would meet with you to get an understanding of the difficulties and to assess your current situation. Based on this information we would think together about what therapeutic approach may be best suited to you. We would also be happy to meet with members of your family or a partner if that would be helpful. We understand that having a child can change your life and throw up challenges along the way that make it hard to feel like a “good enough parent”. We recognise that you are an expert about your child and your family situation. We invite you to bring that knowledge, together with our expertise in evidence-based strategies that have been shown to help parents and their children. In doing so we hope to create a winning team that helps you to move towards your goals. We acknowledge that there is not one “right” answer but we can work together to find strategies that fit you, your child and your family situation. We can work with a variety of difficulties including:\n- Challenging behaviour and tantrums\n- Sleeping and\/or eating difficulties\n- Relationship and communication difficulties\n- Understanding and supporting children with learning or physical disabilities\nWe are experienced at working alongside and supervising other professionals. We understand that working in the helping professions can be stressful in itself and would be happy to meet with mental health professionals from a therapeutic perspective. We are able to offer:\n- Supervision to mental health professionals or other clinical psychologists\n- Therapies for trainee mental health workers\n- Teaching, training and workshops\n- Team building, managing changing circumstances, and building resilience for individuals, teams or groups.\n\nAs a parent with a child newly diagnosed with autism, it can be easy to ask yourself, “What do I do for my child diagnosed with autism?” This is a reaction that is to be expected and can be followed with overwhelming feelings and a lot of questions. The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and\/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual. Click here to sign up now! Where do parents find support? There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.\n\nAssessment is dependent upon our observations of the children. Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?","passages":[{"passage":"Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

Some of the questions you will be asked in the assessment would be:\nIf your child has attended an assessment or therapy elsewhere (another speech and language therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, etc), it would be useful for you to bring reports or share the information from such sessions with your speech and language therapist also. Speech is the ability to use your lips, tongue and other parts of your mouth to produce sounds. To produce clear speech children need to be able to produce the different sounds of speech, as well as understand the rules for putting those sounds together in their language. Most children have mastered the following sounds by the following ages:\nMost children make mistakes in their speech during the first few years of speech development. But by about three years, most children can be understood by their main caregivers. If you’re worried that your child might have a speech disorder, think about how often people who don’t know your child have trouble understanding your child. It’s best to consider seeking help if your child:\nNo. There are some common myths about multilingual development. It is been said to many parents that multilingualism will cause children to develop language at a slower pace. But there is no scientific evidence to support that belief. Many children around the world learn more than one language at the same time and don’t show language delays. A social conversation requires many areas, all of which we are supporting your child in developing. These areas are not limiting but include, vocabulary, concepts, memory, organizing, sequencing skills, to support your child in being able to have a conversation. Yes, all the information pertaining to the case is deemed highly confidential to respect individual privacy and for strictly upholding the ethical standards on which our psychologists function. Only after written consent from the parent\/client can a professional share the information with another specialist if needed. More information can be found regarding this on our consent forms for psychological therapy and assessment. With children, you should ensure familiarity to the process and environment. You can help your child understand what to expect during therapy\/assessment with social stories. You may also introduce your child to his\/her psychologist, here. During the consult session, you may ask your child’s psychologist for more assistance on how to help your child feel less anxious. With teenagers, you should introduce the topic of seeing a psychologist in a gentle manner, when both you and your child are calm. Express your concerns clearly in an open and loving way, and let your child know you want him to be happier, healthier, more productive, and less sad or anxious. Avoid approaching your child with accusations, lectures and angry or disappointed reactions. This leaves them feeling ashamed and would be more reluctant to see a therapist. Also avoid broaching the topic right after an argument. Seeing a psychologist should not be seen as a punishment or threat to ensure compliance. Many teens resist therapy because they may feel there is a taboo to it, or that their friends will find out and believe there is something ‘wrong’ with them. During the consult session, you may speak to the psychologist to find out more about the client-therapist confidentiality and limits; and how to communicate these to your teenager. You may also ask the psychologist for more assistance on how to help your child feel less anxious. Adequately preparing your child for an assessment can reduce anxiety and encourage cooperation through the upcoming battery of tests. Prior to the assessment:\nFor young children:\nFor school-aged children:\nThe night before the assessment:\nOn the day of the assessment:\nDecades of research indicate that the provision of therapy is an interpersonal process in which a main curative component is the nature of the therapeutic relationship. Comparative studies of psychotherapy consistently report that measures of therapeutic relationship correlate more highly with client outcome than specialised therapy techniques. Some therapists are better than others at contributing to positive client outcome. Such therapists are more understanding and accepting, empathic, warm, and supportive. They engage in fewer negative behaviours such as blaming, ignoring, or rejecting.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:709f19ce-bb0c-48f1-beeb-9651ceb80267>"]},{"passage":"For that reason, they often make an oppositional youngster uncomfortable. The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bf776d14-d370-416f-8a38-a212eb6bbf28>"]},{"passage":"You have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children.

The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole.

There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school.

The New York Times recently featured a worthwhile piece entitled, A Doctor’s Guide to a Good Appointment. In that vein, I couldn’t help but add my two cents worth of advice about how to make the best of a family’s first visit to a developmental specialist\nFinding a functional medicine specialist. The opinion of a pediatric neurologist is a good start. But, time is of the essence and evaluations that involve months of waiting serve the patient poorly, because they represent needless delay. A trusted pediatrician can be a great help. Therapists’ views are important because they are independent observers who know the child more intimatel. However, if you still can’t put your finger on what’s wrong, and if you find that you have been going to a variety of specialists (e.g. GI, allergy, dermatologist. pulmonologist), maybe it is time to seek a modern medical viewpoint. When possible, ask other parents about their research and experience, but don’t forget that every child is unique, so this merely represents one piece of the puzzle. The most reliable web advice is to be found at the Medical Academy of Pediatric Special Needs clinician directory. Before your visit:\nLabs, X-rays, MRI’s, EEG’s, IEP’s, psychological reports, hospital records, and evaluations of all types are extremely helpful. It is understandable, however, that some parents may prefer a completely fresh, unbiased opinion, perhaps saving that data for a future visit. At The Child Development Center, we find videos extremely valuable. Taking the time to produce a written history with your specific concerns often yields the most satisfying consultation. On the day of:\nIt may be difficult to appreciate the anxiety that all family members experience in this situation, including the child. Another stranger. More tests. Overcoming fear may require social stories, bribery, a favorite food, electronic devices, or some other tested method. Either a picture, list, or a bag of the present medications and supplements, streamlines the visit. Plus, any archive of past meds – what worked and what didn’t – can similarly improve the efficiency of the interview. Perhaps it goes without saying, but be sure to bring along any familiar toys, blankets, etc., so that the doctor is able to observe the children and the parents can focus on the conversation. Whenever possible, a close family member or therapist will be a valuable addition to the team. An open discussion with the practitioner is imperative. Even the tension caused by a family’s disagreement about whether there really is a problem, is important in making an accurate assessment and creating a useful treatment plan. Back at Home:\nPerhaps this is the most difficult part. Who should you believe? Have any of the previous treatments been particularly successful? Has the child reached some plateau where he\/she seems stuck? What are the alternatives? Listen to your heart. Having reached some degree of non-conventional intervention, there may be a desire to further micromanage. Can 2 functional medicine doctors perform better than one? Although parents who attempt this course may be correct, a mixture of protocols could delay improvement. Get started with one intervention at a time, and become comfortable that nothing is causing harm. Be clear about what skills you are targeting and document progress. Not infrequently, the treatment can involve periods of increased aggression or even regression, due to the ‘die-off’ of harmful organisms, food restriction, arduous therapy sessions, even new-found skills and sensory overload. Close contact with the practitioner (via email, phone, follow-up visits) is a must at this juncture, if the treatment plan is to be followed and successfully implemented. All of the points in the ‘real’ Times article are well-taken and valuable in this instance, as well. Hopefully, this advice will serve to make the experience of taking the next step in your child’s journey even more productive.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9cfa9b88-c4cf-42dd-b527-1f800d2e0cd2>"]},{"passage":"A CYC can help by identifying and providing a suitably in-depth assessment of individual children and adolescents, as well as, designing, implementing and evaluating interventions to assist students (and families if necessary) in dealing with specific school-related issues.

The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and\/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual.

Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:61e7bcf5-822f-47ce-9415-e1eca44301cd>"]}]}

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.\n\nFrom 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.\n\n'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.\n\nWolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall's son, having inherited his father's papers, sued yet again, Chapman's only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. The poem lampooning Jonson's aggressive behaviour and self-believed superiority remained unpublished during Chapman's lifetime, and exists only in documents collected after his death. Plays Comedies By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel.

(Shakespeare apparently was able to learn enough about the content of the \"Iliad,\" whether directly from Chapman's translation, or from an acquaintance with what Chapman was working on acquired otherwise, to enable him to put forth \"Troilus and Cressida\" in 1601-2; that play is remarkable for interweaving the Iliadic story of the deaths of Patroclus and Hector with the quite un-Iliadic story of love betrayed as told first in English by Geoffrey Chaucer in his masterpiece \"Troilus and Criseyde.\") His earliest published works were the obscure philosophical poems The Shadow of Night (1594) and Ovid's Banquet of Sense (1595).

About The Author Two great epics of ancient Greek literature, the Iliad, a classic war story, and the Odyssey, the tale of everyman's journey through life, were believed to have been written by a single poet whom the Greeks named Homer. Nothing is known of his life. While seven Greek cities claim the honor of being his birthplace, ancient tradition places him in Ionia, located in the eastern Aegean. His birthdate is undocumented as well, though most scholars now place the composition of the Iliad and the Odyssey in the late eighth or early seventh century BC. Robert Fagles is Arthur W.

Bernard KnoxÂ is Director Emeritus of Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. Biography We know very little about the author of The Odyssey and its companion tale, The Iliad. Most scholars agree that Homer was Greek; those who try to identify his origin on the basis of dialect forms in the poems tend to choose as his homeland either Smyrna, now the Turkish city known as Izmir, or Chios, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea. According to legend, Homer was blind, though scholarly evidence can neither confirm nor contradict the point. The ongoing debate about who Homer was, when he lived, and even if he wrote The Odyssey and The Iliad is known as the \"Homeric question.\" Classicists do agree that these tales of the fall of the city of Troy (Ilium) in the Trojan War (The Iliad) and the aftermath of that ten-year battle (The Odyssey) coincide with the ending of the Mycenaean period around 1200 BCE (a date that corresponds with the end of the Bronze Age throughout the Eastern Mediterranean). The Mycenaeans were a society of warriors and traders; beginning around 1600 BCE, they became a major power in the Mediterranean. Brilliant potters and architects, they also developed a system of writing known as Linear B, based on a syllabary, writing in which each symbol stands for a syllable. Scholars disagree on when Homer lived or when he might have written The Odyssey. Some have placed Homer in the late-Mycenaean period, which means he would have written about the Trojan War as recent history. Close study of the texts, however, reveals aspects of political, material, religious, and military life of the Bronze Age and of the so-called Dark Age, as the period of domination by the less-advanced Dorian invaders who usurped the Mycenaeans is known. But how, other scholars argue, could Homer have created works of such magnitude in the Dark Age, when there was no system of writing? Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, placed Homer sometime around the ninth century BCE, at the beginning of the Archaic period, in which the Greeks adopted a system of writing from the Phoenicians and widely colonized the Mediterranean. And modern scholarship shows that the most recent details in the poems are datable to the period between 750 and 700 BCE. No one, however, disputes the fact that The Odyssey (and The Iliad as well) arose from oral tradition.","passages":[{"passage":"A Burlesque Translation of Homer, by Thomas Bridges; 1797; G.G. and J.Robinson, London\nHomer’s Iliad set to bawdy verse by Thomas Bridges (c.1710-c.1775), originally published in 1762 under the pseudonym Caustic Barebones.

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d6be2450-699b-4573-87d2-9ebc4f0d58c3>"]},{"passage":"From 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bc6d0d4a-886d-49ee-9c0f-26597634f183>"]},{"passage":"'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'.

Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years.

And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it.

Bernard KnoxÂ is Director Emeritus of Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. Biography We know very little about the author of The Odyssey and its companion tale, The Iliad. Most scholars agree that Homer was Greek; those who try to identify his origin on the basis of dialect forms in the poems tend to choose as his homeland either Smyrna, now the Turkish city known as Izmir, or Chios, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea. According to legend, Homer was blind, though scholarly evidence can neither confirm nor contradict the point. The ongoing debate about who Homer was, when he lived, and even if he wrote The Odyssey and The Iliad is known as the \"Homeric question.\" Classicists do agree that these tales of the fall of the city of Troy (Ilium) in the Trojan War (The Iliad) and the aftermath of that ten-year battle (The Odyssey) coincide with the ending of the Mycenaean period around 1200 BCE (a date that corresponds with the end of the Bronze Age throughout the Eastern Mediterranean). The Mycenaeans were a society of warriors and traders; beginning around 1600 BCE, they became a major power in the Mediterranean. Brilliant potters and architects, they also developed a system of writing known as Linear B, based on a syllabary, writing in which each symbol stands for a syllable. Scholars disagree on when Homer lived or when he might have written The Odyssey. Some have placed Homer in the late-Mycenaean period, which means he would have written about the Trojan War as recent history. Close study of the texts, however, reveals aspects of political, material, religious, and military life of the Bronze Age and of the so-called Dark Age, as the period of domination by the less-advanced Dorian invaders who usurped the Mycenaeans is known. But how, other scholars argue, could Homer have created works of such magnitude in the Dark Age, when there was no system of writing? Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, placed Homer sometime around the ninth century BCE, at the beginning of the Archaic period, in which the Greeks adopted a system of writing from the Phoenicians and widely colonized the Mediterranean. And modern scholarship shows that the most recent details in the poems are datable to the period between 750 and 700 BCE. No one, however, disputes the fact that The Odyssey (and The Iliad as well) arose from oral tradition.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:08eefe8e-e708-46d9-8670-9bff75eb0071>"]}]}

But in exercising the sensors of those test probes, we made the remarkable discovery that there is water in the Cumberland! At first, we were sure that it had to be a faulty reading or a broken instrument, but seven different tests on multiple instruments confirmed the finding!”\nNASA scientists revealed that their findings indicate that the Cumberland River’s elemental make-up contains a staggering 14% water content. The rest, they say, is a mix of spilled beer from Dancin’ In the District concerts in the 1990s, misplaced Red Bulls from various marathons and 5Ks, discarded flyers from your neighbor’s set at Tin Roof, an as-yet-unclassified semi-gaseous element which they are currently calling “Nashvillium”, and the tears of frustrated Titan’s fans. The science team claim they have been withholding their findings for several years until now, so as not to tip off the public that seeking water was an objective of their search on Mars.

The amount of electric power that is drawn from TVA’s electric system at a given point in time. An enclosed dam chamber with gates at each end that allow water to be admitted and released. The resulting change in water level allows vessels to be raised and lowered so they can pass over non-navigable parts of a river. The locks on the Tennessee River make navigation possible for 652 miles, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Paducah, Kentucky. Main-river, or main-stem, reservoirs\nReservoirs where the seasonal lowering to provide storage for flood damage reduction is typically less than seven feet. Main-river reservoirs include (upstream to downstream) Fort Loudoun, Watts Bar, Chickamauga, Nickajack, Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, Pickwick, and Kentucky. They were designed to serve multiple purposes, especially commercial navigation and hydropower production. An amount of energy that equals one million watt-hours. It is a common measure for electricity use over time. A release from one or more dams provided to meet hydropower production, reservoir level targets, downstream water needs (such as aquatic habitat, water supply, and waste assimilation), and other commitments. Project minimum flows are those required to be released from a specific dam over a specific time period — not the lowest amount of water that TVA can pass through a dam. System minimum flows are those needed at some point in the system to meet specific needs for power, waste assimilation, navigation, and other beneficial uses. Minimum operations guide\nThe system minimum operations guide is a seasonal guide based on the sum of the storage in 10 tributary projects. It is used to determine what level of flow should be released from these projects when additional flow is required to meet downstream needs.

The story in 2012 could not be more different; the river has approached record-low levels in places. The contrast is illustrated in these two images, which show a stretch of the river just south of Memphis, Tennessee. Landsat 7 captured the top image on August 8, 2012, while Landsat 5 took the lower image on August 14, 2011. (The images are rotated so that north is to the left.) In the August 2011 image, the river was three months removed from the peak of the floods, and river gauges recorded levels close to normal for the month. In August 2012, water was several feet below the historic normal stage for Memphis, and many sandbars were newly exposed or greatly expanded. As of August 17, 2012, river gauges in the Memphis region recorded levels at -2.4 to -8.3 feet (below historic normal stage). At the time of the August 2011 image (lower), the river stage was 11.7 feet. (In May 2011, the river peaked at 56.6 feet in the same location.) The Mississippi River is a major North American transit route, carrying goods to and from ports in New Orleans and Baton Rogue. The top image shows that low water levels have narrowed the river from a superhighway to a small road. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers maintains a 9-foot shipping channel in the lower Mississippi and has dredges working around the clock to keep the channel clear. Not only are water levels low in 2012, but the floods of 2011 dropped a layer of sediment on the riverbed, reshaping previously open channels. The reduced river flow in 2012 has translated into millions of dollars in extra shipping costs, as the loss of just one inch of draft means that a barge can carry 17 tons less than it otherwise would. The result is decreased shipping capacity. Reduced water levels had one positive impact: The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has been able to access and repair levees that were damaged in last year’s floods. The levees are the tan lines that surround the river in these images. - Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. (2012, August 17). Mississippi River at Memphis. NOAA National Weather Service.

Additionally, many nations rely on rivers for their drinking water supply; therefore, it is important to be mindful of areas around river mouths that are susceptible to damage from human interference. 5. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us predict floods, riverbank erosion, and other hazards. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us predict floods, riverbank erosion, and other hazards because rivers begin at high elevations with runoff from rainfall. As the water flows downstream, it gathers more water from tributaries, streams, and rivers that run into it. This increases the amount of water carried by the river and increases its potential for flooding or erosion along its path. Additionally, human interference can change how rivers flow which impacts their ability to provide vital resources such as alluvium or freshwater. 6. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us develop plans for flood prevention, land management, and conservation. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us develop plans for flood prevention, land management, and conservation. By understanding where rivers begin and where they end, we can better understand how they affect the land around them. This knowledge can be used to create strategies for preventing flooding in vulnerable areas, managing land use in areas with high levels of runoff from mountain ranges, and protecting valuable ecosystems around rivers that provide habitat for wildlife. The source of a river is generally located on high ground where there is an abundant source of water, such as melting snow or spring overflow. The mouth of a river is where it flows into another body of water, such as an ocean or lake, or ends in dry land if there are no other bodies nearby. Knowing these two points gives us spatial information about how the river might impact its surrounding area depending on its source and mouth locations. 7. The source and mouth of a river can tell us about the history, culture, and economy of a region. The source and mouth of a river can provide us with important information about the history, culture, and economy of a region. For example:\n• The source of the river may reveal how that region was first settled – for example, if it is located near an abundant spring or melting snow. • The mouth of the river may tell us about how people have interacted with that area over time – for example, if they have used it as a trading post or as a source of food. • The presence or absence of tributaries can reveal how interconnected communities are in that area – for example, if there are no tributaries, then communities may not be as connected compared to areas with many tributaries joining into one large river system. Different types of river sources and mouth features\n1. River Mouth\nThe features of a river mouth include:\n– The mouth is where the river enters into a new body of water, such as a bay, sea, or ocean. – As the water flow from the river slows down and deposits mixtures of sediment called alluvium along the discharge area at a river mouth, distributary streams form, which branch off into smaller streams called mouths that flow into the new body of water. – These mouths are surrounded by deltas – areas where sediments have piled up due to slow currents and wave action – which can range in size from small hills to large islands. – River mouths also tend to have estuaries which are areas where tidal influences meet freshwater flows and create brackish waters rich in nutrients for marine life forms like fish and crustaceans. A river delta is a region where a river meets an ocean, lake, or wetland, and its water slows down and spreads out into a fan shape. Deltas are characterized by sediment deposits, changes in the speed of water flow, and the development of distributary streams that branch off from the main river. These distributaries stem from one body of water but can lead to multiple outflow channels into another body of water, such as an ocean or lake. Some examples of deltas include:\n– The Nile River Delta, where the Nile River meets the Mediterranean Sea\n– The Amazon River Delta, which spews sediment into the Atlantic Ocean\n3. Great Flood\nThe Great Flood, also known as the Great Deluge or the Great Cataclysm, refers to a major flood that is believed to have occurred around 2300 BC.\n\n- Provide the purpose and need statement, or the corridor vision and transportation goals and objectives to realize that vision. - What steps will need to be taken during the NEPA process to make this a project-level purpose and need statement? 6.

Effects to the natural and built environment were avoided and minimized where feasible as part of the conceptual engineering that was conducted in support of the Draft EIS. Where negative impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, they are mitigated where required. Mitigation can be accomplished through repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the impacted environment. Sometimes impacts are compensated for by replacing or providing substitute resources. Mitigations will continue to be addressed throughout the Draft and Final EIS process. Specific mitigations identified for consideration to date in the Draft EIS include the following:\n- Natural Resources: For every wetland acre that is destroyed, compensatory wetlands must be created or purchased from a wetland bank, as well as the use of best Management Practices to ensure sufficient measures during and after construction. Construction would be regulated to adhere to a strict schedule with possible time-of-year restrictions as necessary. - Geologic Resources: Due to the nature of railroad construction, the need to compensate for limiting soil characteristics is likely negated. Minimization was considered through alternatives development process. - Hazardous Materials: Any hazardous material discovered will be removed and disposed of in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All necessary remediation would be conducted in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and would be coordinated with the EPA, DEQ, and other federal or state agencies as necessary. All solid waste material resulting from clearing and grubbing, demolition, or other construction operations would be removed and disposed of according to regulations. - Air Quality: Dust and airborne dirt generated by construction activities will be controlled through dust control procedures or a specific dust control plan in accordance with the provisions on fugitive dust control in the VDOT Road and Bridge Specifications. - Noise & Vibration: Use of continuously welded rail (CWR) to reduce the effects of noise and vibration from train operations and\/ or use of buffer zones between the tracks and receptors\n- Visual: Construction of any new structures to be similar in kind, size, and character to existing structures\n- Community Resources: The acquisition of right-of-way and the relocation of displaced persons and businesses would be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended. Assurance is given that relocation resources would be available to residential, business, farm, and nonprofit displacees without discrimination\n- Environmental Justice: Coordination with affected communities where any disproportionate impacts are identified\n- Park Resources: Where avoidance of park resources is not possible, any impacts will be coordinated with the park owners to determine agreement with a Section 4(f) De Minimis taking and to determine compensation of land if any Section 6(f) properties are impacted. - Cultural Resources: Where avoidance of historic properties is not possible, measures will be undertaken to minimize and mitigate for impacts. Historic properties affected by this project will be included in the Project Section 106 agreement document, where stipulations to mitigate any adverse effects will be clearly outlined. Additional minimization and avoidance measures can occur throughout the Preliminary and Final Design, such as alignment modifications to shift the limits of disturbance to avoid or minimize certain resource impacts. Passenger trains are much quieter than longer, heavier freight trains. Most unwelcome train noise occurs at road crossings where trains are required to blow horns and whistles as a safety warning to drivers. Noise and vibration analyses will be conducted as part of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which will be available for review and comment in late 2016. Measures to mitigate potential noise impacts will be evaluated as part of the noise analyses. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is being prepared to gather data about the environment along the project corridor, including impacts to wetlands and other aquatic resources. DRPT’s evaluation of wetlands is being coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. This information will be available as part of the Draft EIS, available now on the Draft EIS page. The EIS will recommend measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate impacts to wetlands.\n\nUsing the CyArk Hazard map (linked above), locate the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The city of New Orleans is a US city with a long history. One of the oldest cities in the US, New Orleans has become known as a cultural melting pot with a unique culture and cuisine. New Orleans is home to a rich culture, famous for their festivals, such as Mardi Gras, and is also known as the birthplace of jazz. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused considerable damage to the city of New Orleans. Many of the city's levees broke which caused water levels to rise, leaving much of the city underwater. In the events of global warming, New Orleans faces the danger of becoming submerged under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico once again. Zoom in on the city of New Orleans to zoom level 7.

Mariah Timms, USA Today Network-Tennessee\nThe Nashville Weather Service predicts Sunday will be partly sunny, then gradually becoming sunny, with a high near 53. Overnight, the low may drop below freezing before swinging up to a sunny, low-50s Monday. The sun will be out, but rain runoff will still be moving through the area. Water-covered roadways are dangerous even in daylight. Rivers to remain high, at flood potential\nSeveral rivers remain under a flood warning until Tuesday night as swollen waterways continue in the area after a record-breaking amount of rainfall in February. \"Water is going to be slow to go down,\" Rose said. Rivers, especially, are \"not going to drop as fast as places that get flash flooded.\" The Harpeth and Cumberland Rivers will be under flood warnings until Tuesday night at several points in Davidson County. Browns Creek reached minor flooding stage Saturday night after heavy rain. The NWS lists five stages of flooding on its river forecast map: Major flooding, moderate flooding, minor flooding, near flood stage and no flooding. Moderate flooding was predicted at the Harpeth River near Kingston Springs, Duck River at Columbia and Duck River at Centerville. Both the Cumberland and the Harpeth are expected to reach moderate flood stage, likely impacting greenways and industrial areas along their banks, according to NWS and Metro Nashville Water Services predictions. Flooding likely low-impact\nMetro Water Services said Saturday it does not anticipate the Cumberland downtown to rise to a level that is a concern to businesses in that area. Businesses or buildings with underground garages or structures should take precautions. The Cumberland River's flood stage is 40 feet in downtown Nashville. On Saturday night, the Cumberland River's water level was at 39.59 feet, according to NWS data. It's expected to hit 43.8 feet by Sunday evening. According to the NWS, at 42 feet, Riverfront Park is flooded to the fourth grassy area, as well as other recreational and greenway areas along the river. Portions of Cowan Street and Cowan Court are flooded and may be impassable. Industrial properties on Davidson Street, North First Street, Cowan Street and Cowan Court are also flooded.

The story in 2012 could not be more different; the river has approached record-low levels in places. The contrast is illustrated in these two images, which show a stretch of the river just south of Memphis, Tennessee. Landsat 7 captured the top image on August 8, 2012, while Landsat 5 took the lower image on August 14, 2011. (The images are rotated so that north is to the left.) In the August 2011 image, the river was three months removed from the peak of the floods, and river gauges recorded levels close to normal for the month. In August 2012, water was several feet below the historic normal stage for Memphis, and many sandbars were newly exposed or greatly expanded. As of August 17, 2012, river gauges in the Memphis region recorded levels at -2.4 to -8.3 feet (below historic normal stage). At the time of the August 2011 image (lower), the river stage was 11.7 feet. (In May 2011, the river peaked at 56.6 feet in the same location.) The Mississippi River is a major North American transit route, carrying goods to and from ports in New Orleans and Baton Rogue. The top image shows that low water levels have narrowed the river from a superhighway to a small road. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers maintains a 9-foot shipping channel in the lower Mississippi and has dredges working around the clock to keep the channel clear. Not only are water levels low in 2012, but the floods of 2011 dropped a layer of sediment on the riverbed, reshaping previously open channels. The reduced river flow in 2012 has translated into millions of dollars in extra shipping costs, as the loss of just one inch of draft means that a barge can carry 17 tons less than it otherwise would. The result is decreased shipping capacity. Reduced water levels had one positive impact: The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has been able to access and repair levees that were damaged in last year’s floods. The levees are the tan lines that surround the river in these images. - Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. (2012, August 17). Mississippi River at Memphis. NOAA National Weather Service.

Additionally, many nations rely on rivers for their drinking water supply; therefore, it is important to be mindful of areas around river mouths that are susceptible to damage from human interference. 5. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us predict floods, riverbank erosion, and other hazards. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us predict floods, riverbank erosion, and other hazards because rivers begin at high elevations with runoff from rainfall. As the water flows downstream, it gathers more water from tributaries, streams, and rivers that run into it. This increases the amount of water carried by the river and increases its potential for flooding or erosion along its path. Additionally, human interference can change how rivers flow which impacts their ability to provide vital resources such as alluvium or freshwater. 6. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us develop plans for flood prevention, land management, and conservation. Knowing the source and mouth of a river can help us develop plans for flood prevention, land management, and conservation. By understanding where rivers begin and where they end, we can better understand how they affect the land around them. This knowledge can be used to create strategies for preventing flooding in vulnerable areas, managing land use in areas with high levels of runoff from mountain ranges, and protecting valuable ecosystems around rivers that provide habitat for wildlife. The source of a river is generally located on high ground where there is an abundant source of water, such as melting snow or spring overflow. The mouth of a river is where it flows into another body of water, such as an ocean or lake, or ends in dry land if there are no other bodies nearby. Knowing these two points gives us spatial information about how the river might impact its surrounding area depending on its source and mouth locations. 7. The source and mouth of a river can tell us about the history, culture, and economy of a region. The source and mouth of a river can provide us with important information about the history, culture, and economy of a region. For example:\n• The source of the river may reveal how that region was first settled – for example, if it is located near an abundant spring or melting snow. • The mouth of the river may tell us about how people have interacted with that area over time – for example, if they have used it as a trading post or as a source of food. • The presence or absence of tributaries can reveal how interconnected communities are in that area – for example, if there are no tributaries, then communities may not be as connected compared to areas with many tributaries joining into one large river system. Different types of river sources and mouth features\n1. River Mouth\nThe features of a river mouth include:\n– The mouth is where the river enters into a new body of water, such as a bay, sea, or ocean. – As the water flow from the river slows down and deposits mixtures of sediment called alluvium along the discharge area at a river mouth, distributary streams form, which branch off into smaller streams called mouths that flow into the new body of water. – These mouths are surrounded by deltas – areas where sediments have piled up due to slow currents and wave action – which can range in size from small hills to large islands. – River mouths also tend to have estuaries which are areas where tidal influences meet freshwater flows and create brackish waters rich in nutrients for marine life forms like fish and crustaceans. A river delta is a region where a river meets an ocean, lake, or wetland, and its water slows down and spreads out into a fan shape. Deltas are characterized by sediment deposits, changes in the speed of water flow, and the development of distributary streams that branch off from the main river. These distributaries stem from one body of water but can lead to multiple outflow channels into another body of water, such as an ocean or lake. Some examples of deltas include:\n– The Nile River Delta, where the Nile River meets the Mediterranean Sea\n– The Amazon River Delta, which spews sediment into the Atlantic Ocean\n3. Great Flood\nThe Great Flood, also known as the Great Deluge or the Great Cataclysm, refers to a major flood that is believed to have occurred around 2300 BC.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1e5c4bc6-ab76-468f-b721-c7af8113f96e>"]},{"passage":"- Provide the purpose and need statement, or the corridor vision and transportation goals and objectives to realize that vision. - What steps will need to be taken during the NEPA process to make this a project-level purpose and need statement? 6.

Sometimes impacts are compensated for by replacing or providing substitute resources. Mitigations will continue to be addressed throughout the Draft and Final EIS process. Specific mitigations identified for consideration to date in the Draft EIS include the following:\n- Natural Resources: For every wetland acre that is destroyed, compensatory wetlands must be created or purchased from a wetland bank, as well as the use of best Management Practices to ensure sufficient measures during and after construction. Construction would be regulated to adhere to a strict schedule with possible time-of-year restrictions as necessary. - Geologic Resources: Due to the nature of railroad construction, the need to compensate for limiting soil characteristics is likely negated. Minimization was considered through alternatives development process. - Hazardous Materials: Any hazardous material discovered will be removed and disposed of in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All necessary remediation would be conducted in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and would be coordinated with the EPA, DEQ, and other federal or state agencies as necessary. All solid waste material resulting from clearing and grubbing, demolition, or other construction operations would be removed and disposed of according to regulations. - Air Quality: Dust and airborne dirt generated by construction activities will be controlled through dust control procedures or a specific dust control plan in accordance with the provisions on fugitive dust control in the VDOT Road and Bridge Specifications. - Noise & Vibration: Use of continuously welded rail (CWR) to reduce the effects of noise and vibration from train operations and\/ or use of buffer zones between the tracks and receptors\n- Visual: Construction of any new structures to be similar in kind, size, and character to existing structures\n- Community Resources: The acquisition of right-of-way and the relocation of displaced persons and businesses would be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended. Assurance is given that relocation resources would be available to residential, business, farm, and nonprofit displacees without discrimination\n- Environmental Justice: Coordination with affected communities where any disproportionate impacts are identified\n- Park Resources: Where avoidance of park resources is not possible, any impacts will be coordinated with the park owners to determine agreement with a Section 4(f) De Minimis taking and to determine compensation of land if any Section 6(f) properties are impacted. - Cultural Resources: Where avoidance of historic properties is not possible, measures will be undertaken to minimize and mitigate for impacts.

The demand for highly educated professionals to research and adopt more sustainable methods is greater than ever. In this post, we explain sustainability and give a rundown of degrees and employment available in the area. 1. An urbanist\nUrban planners’ main responsibilities are to help businesses and organisation create plans for the use of land. In the designs of an urban planner, communities, road networks, parks, and the general layout of a city might frequently be given priority. Urban planners also create policies or strategies to handle expanding populations while having the least possible negative environmental effects. 2. Landscape designer\nIn order to integrate man-made structures smoothly with the environment, landscape architects first conduct a survey of the area’s natural geology and topography. It is possible for landscape architects to work on creating animal habitats, distinctive locations, or long-lasting infrastructure systems in both urban and rural settings. 3. Environmental geologists\nResearching alternate sources of energy and resources is a crucial component of projects pertaining to Sustainability Jobs. An environmental geologist is crucial when advising mining and gas corporations on the acquisition and use of energy resources. 4. Environmental advisor\nAn environmental consultant often works on a contract basis with companies in the public or private sectors, such as water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and other businesses whose operations may have an impact on the environment. Environmental consultants can offer advice and planning solutions for issues including soil contamination, air quality, and water pollution. 5. Environmental scientist\nEnvironmental scientists search for the most effective ways to safeguard the environment and advance human health. Environmental scientists frequently conduct research into health and environmental issues, seek to pinpoint their root causes, and develop solutions for these issues in both the public and commercial sectors. An environmental scientist could investigate and examine enigmatic diseases, strange wildlife malformations, or sickness in a population with an unidentified source. Ecologists’ main responsibilities are to investigate and address how human behavior affects and influences the environment. An ecologist may work for environmental nonprofits, doing study and developing solutions to environmental issues brought on by human activity, consumption, and influence on the environment. Ecologists may even be a member of a research team that examines and investigates how community actions such as construction, restoration, and others affect ecosystems. 7. Air quality engineer\nAir quality engineers employ advanced monitoring procedures, chemical and statistical studies, and three-dimensional computer modelling to analyse the air pollution in a specific location. Air quality engineers occasionally develop or alter pollution-control machinery. In order to assess and study the effects of certain activities on the local surroundings, air quality engineers typically focus their efforts in or near big cities. 8. Engineering in the environment\nPrimary responsibilities: Environmental engineers provide solutions to environmental problems by combining environmental information with engineering concepts. Examples of environmental knowledge include soil composition and biological and ecological processes. Environmental engineers may work on initiatives or programmes to enhance public health, waste management and recycling, as well as initiatives to reduce or regulate air and water pollution. 9. Energy supervisor\nThe main responsibilities of energy managers are audits to guarantee effective use of resources, both financial and environmental. They could work for the government or the business sector. In the majority of cases, energy managers discover that the creation of new city projects, municipal plans, and governmental contracts requires their services. Energy managers may also be in charge of reducing the amount of energy and water used by creating projects that adhere to tight design guidelines, statutory requirements, and financial constraints. 10. Engineer in sustainability\nA sustainability engineer’s main responsibilities include developing strategies, evaluating locations, and studying financial data to create and implement renewable energy projects. Although Sustainability Jobs engineers often operate inside, they occasionally need to travel to certain job sites in order to effectively formulate task designs, comprehend necessary job specifications, and get more familiar with the project at hand. Many businesses provide Sustainability Jobs employment, which give the environment hope for a bright future. The prognosis for employment in sustainability will also continue to improve as the population continues to grow and businesses and organisation search for innovative methods to develop, manufacture, and utilise fuel resources in environmentally appropriate applications.\n\nBuilding managers work in many different environments, depending on their specific job placement. They may work in schools, hospitals, residential and commercial buildings, and offices. The main work of a building manager is to ensure that the assigned building remains in a clean and maintained condition at all times and that it is constantly secure. Typically, a high school diploma or a GED equivalent is sufficient to work as a building manager. You may have a better chance of obtaining the position if you have worked in a similar role before.

As more organizations automate internal processes related to sustainability, EHS and energy management, asset management is another area that overlaps. Companies can expect more energy management features in asset management software and may, in some situations, be able to meet their needs with a single application rather than two. Energy management and asset management have different initial aims. Energy management seeks to reduce the energy cost of operating building and factory equipment and is typically the purview of the facilities, energy or operations team at the local, and increasingly, the corporate level. Asset management intends to avoid downtime of production lines and facilities and to save costs and is used by the facilities or operations team at the local level. Historically, energy management and asset management have been separate processes with separate software solutions. However, more teams are realizing a connection between energy management and asset management. Real-time energy consumption and other attribute monitoring can be used to detect problems with roof-top units (RTU) and other HVAC equipment, motors, and fans as well as to identify energy savings opportunities. Several companies now have their asset management team coordinate work with the energy management team. With real-time monitoring of equipment, operators aim to proactively recognize opportunities quickly and to apply preventive maintenance actions before responding to outright equipment failure. Both asset and energy management requires identifying assets, monitoring real-time equipment usage, and alerting operators of problems. Software vendors are responding to this emerging need. Traditional asset management vendors such as IBM\/Maximo and Infor have added initial energy management capabilities and energy management vendors who utilize interval data are adding basic asset management capabilities to their core products. A single software product for each process makes sense. A single master list of equipment (name plate info, age, drawings, etc.) can be used for both asset management and energy management. Proposed and completed maintenance and energy projects can be tracked in one system. Operators and facility managers will receive the same type of alerts and work orders for both maintenance and energy improvements. Such an approach doesn’t fit all situations and associated vendor capabilities are still nascent in many cases. But energy and maintenance leaders should monitor this trend and may find situations where it make sense to add light weight asset management to an energy management implementation or conversely to supplement an asset management deployment with energy monitoring capabilities.

The conventional wisdom is that the current softness in the economy has weakened demand for energy. Ultimately, the nation's energy infrastructure needs to be expanded and upgraded. Additional gas-fired energy plants will tax the gas distribution network, said Graham. A grim outlook\nSo what about the future? Veteran developer Dan Packard, founder and certified property manager of Denver-based PowerSpring, an Internet-based energy information application, is pessimistic. He believes property managers are too passive in seeking solutions for energy costs. Packard cites California's energy crisis as an example. “The West Coast energy issue has been beaten to death,” said Packard. “The expression there by property managers today is that Gov. Gray Davis has stepped in and solved the problem.” Many Americans incorrectly believe the energy crisis is over because the issue currently isn't heavily covered by the media, Packard added. Analysts say property managers across the country have not begun to implement energy solutions for their portfolios to stop the decline in FFO and net operating income attributable to energy costs. “At the present pace, it will be many years before they recognize the needs of their tenants,” Packard said. “Over this period, the best of tenants [those willing to pay the highest rents] will have moved on to other space that offers extensive menus of value-added services, including many energy options,” concluded Packard. “The property manager who is slow to react will be out of a job.”\nSome enlightening energy management tips\nEnergy costs don't always have to rise. Experts say they actually can decrease, if an efficient energy system is put in place. Here are some suggestions from Rob Bagguley, president of property and facilities management at Chicago-based Transwestern Commercial Services, and others to energize the thinking of a real estate owner, operator or manager:\nChill out. Install energy management systems that better control equipment, add efficiency and save power. Air conditioners, for instance, gobble up huge amounts of electricity. Most traditional commercial cooling systems, called chillers, operate during the day when rates are highest. Some property managers have sought to cut costs and conserve energy by running chiller systems during off-peak hours. Think differently. Does cleaning have to be done in the dead of night with different crews on different floors? Bagguley urges building owners to coordinate cleaning staffs. “It's a simple concept,” he explained. “Assemble crews on one floor, complete that floor and then have them move on to another. You'll finish a floor in a shorter time frame.”\nGo back to the basics. For example, if outdoor lighting is automated, use a digital clock that has more accurate timing and reflects changes in daylight-saving time to control the lighting. Turn lights on only when needed and off when they are not in use. Consider motion monitors that trigger the on switch when a person is in the office. Check out a building's equipment. Retrofit air conditioners with energy-efficient machines. Determine when power peaks. If owners or property managers can lower that peak demand, they will significantly affect their rate structure. Stagger times for equipment start-up and shutdown. Instead of using energy in a bell-shaped curve, where energy use starts out flat and then climbs rapidly before falling again, monitor energy usage. Consider alternate sources of power. Rather than obtaining 100% of power from a grid, consider using an on-site generator to control peak costs that could provide 25% to 50% of the energy needed at the site. Not only will such a system reduce costs, but it also could help in an emergency. Owners and operators also could opt for a hybrid system that combines electricity and gas. Take advantage of programs offered by utilities and energy manufacturers. In California and other states, energy companies offer rebate programs to entice owners to replace fluorescent light bulbs with lower-wattage bulbs, thereby creating significant savings. Lighting manufacturers typically offer financing, and the payback can be realized in less than two years. At the same time, tenants see the benefits of their conservation efforts. Get everyone involved with the program. The age of tenants is changing. Generation X is more concerned about energy conservation. Seek to make everyone more conservation-conscious not only from an economic viewpoint, but also from an environmental one. Work with tenants.\n\nWhat Are Energy Consultant Jobs\nWhat are Energy Consultant jobs? The position of an Energy Consultant is a new one in today’s business landscape and provides the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of a fast-changing industry. Overall, Energy Consultants are the specialists companies hire to reevaluate every aspect of energy usage within the organisation and seek solutions for making the company greener and more efficient. In a world where climate change has become a very real and pressing matter, companies are in a unique position to be catalysts for real change. By altering their consumption habits, businesses can set new precedents in their industries and begin the long road to reversing the rising tide of carbon emissions worldwide. Energy Consultants typically work for companies that run large-scale production facilities or manufacturing plants with high energy demands. But as the regulatory legislation becomes ever more stringent, the demand for energy consultation is extending into many fields and sectors. Energy Consultant Job Description\nThe job of an Energy Consultant spans a broad range of skills and areas of knowledge. Companies have an economic incentive to become more energy efficient, both because of potential tax benefits and also simply because the cost of energy is a significant expenditure for many businesses. So, Energy Consultants start by examining the usage patterns of the companies that hire them. The energy experts study all sources of energy the company has drawn from over the course of the past few years, investigate potential local and technological options for achieving greater efficiencies, and conduct feasibility studies to determine challenges to implementing green solutions, this might mean switching to solar or wind energy, for instance. Or it might mean upgrading inefficient machinery to newer models with greater efficiency. They typically work for large corporations, and so their studies often necessitate evaluating multi-step manufacturing or production processes that occur in multiple facilities that are geographically dispersed so the complexity of the energy consumption picture for a business is often incredibly complicated, necessitating careful study, thorough analysis, and creative problem solving. 5 Primary Responsibilities Of An Energy Consultant\n- Reduce Consumption: The ultimate goal of the profession is to examine every possible option for cutting usage, this might mean implementing new technology, reversing wasteful habits, or even altering manufacturing or production processes. - Increase Efficiency: Most often, increases in efficiency are achieved through the implementation of new technology or the transition to renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines. It is the consultant’s job to evaluate which options are best suited for the company in question. - Evaluate Systems: To institute greener systems and policies, an Energy Consultant must first painstakingly evaluate the usage demands of the current systems in place. These systems range from working hours to machinery to the energy awareness of employees, all of which fall under the purview of the consultant. - Map Usage: Many major corporations function through a complex system of interconnected facilities, shipping routes, offices, and warehouses. In many cases, these companies have never had a map of their total energy usage and have thus never been able to have a comprehensive picture of how and where the company consumes the most energy resources. - Provide Options: As with all consultant work, the duty of an EC is to provide as many actionable options as possible, with detailed explanations of the pros and cons and feasibility of each possibility, to help the company’s officers decide what and how to go about improving efficiency. 10 Day-to-Day Energy Consultancy Duties\n- Study current energy sources\n- Investigate alternate energy sources\n- Evaluate the company’s usage about regulatory requirements for the industry and proposed regulatory requirements expected in the future\n- Write concise, clear reports about findings and suggestions\n- Justify conclusions in meetings with executives\n- Meet with managers and employees to form a clear picture of consumption habits\n- Analyse data using data modelling software\n- Conduct feasibility studies\n- Brainstorm creative solutions to identified problems\n- Participate in routine visits to customers\nEnergy Consultant Salary\nThe average salary for an Energy Consultant in the UK is about £27,000 annually. Those in the upper echelons of the profession, however, can earn more than £50,000. Many Energy Consultants work on a contract basis, though there are also many full-time positions in the field.

The demand for highly educated professionals to research and adopt more sustainable methods is greater than ever. In this post, we explain sustainability and give a rundown of degrees and employment available in the area. 1. An urbanist\nUrban planners’ main responsibilities are to help businesses and organisation create plans for the use of land. In the designs of an urban planner, communities, road networks, parks, and the general layout of a city might frequently be given priority. Urban planners also create policies or strategies to handle expanding populations while having the least possible negative environmental effects. 2. Landscape designer\nIn order to integrate man-made structures smoothly with the environment, landscape architects first conduct a survey of the area’s natural geology and topography. It is possible for landscape architects to work on creating animal habitats, distinctive locations, or long-lasting infrastructure systems in both urban and rural settings. 3. Environmental geologists\nResearching alternate sources of energy and resources is a crucial component of projects pertaining to Sustainability Jobs. An environmental geologist is crucial when advising mining and gas corporations on the acquisition and use of energy resources. 4. Environmental advisor\nAn environmental consultant often works on a contract basis with companies in the public or private sectors, such as water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and other businesses whose operations may have an impact on the environment. Environmental consultants can offer advice and planning solutions for issues including soil contamination, air quality, and water pollution. 5. Environmental scientist\nEnvironmental scientists search for the most effective ways to safeguard the environment and advance human health. Environmental scientists frequently conduct research into health and environmental issues, seek to pinpoint their root causes, and develop solutions for these issues in both the public and commercial sectors. An environmental scientist could investigate and examine enigmatic diseases, strange wildlife malformations, or sickness in a population with an unidentified source. Ecologists’ main responsibilities are to investigate and address how human behavior affects and influences the environment. An ecologist may work for environmental nonprofits, doing study and developing solutions to environmental issues brought on by human activity, consumption, and influence on the environment. Ecologists may even be a member of a research team that examines and investigates how community actions such as construction, restoration, and others affect ecosystems. 7. Air quality engineer\nAir quality engineers employ advanced monitoring procedures, chemical and statistical studies, and three-dimensional computer modelling to analyse the air pollution in a specific location. Air quality engineers occasionally develop or alter pollution-control machinery. In order to assess and study the effects of certain activities on the local surroundings, air quality engineers typically focus their efforts in or near big cities. 8. Engineering in the environment\nPrimary responsibilities: Environmental engineers provide solutions to environmental problems by combining environmental information with engineering concepts. Examples of environmental knowledge include soil composition and biological and ecological processes. Environmental engineers may work on initiatives or programmes to enhance public health, waste management and recycling, as well as initiatives to reduce or regulate air and water pollution. 9. Energy supervisor\nThe main responsibilities of energy managers are audits to guarantee effective use of resources, both financial and environmental. They could work for the government or the business sector. In the majority of cases, energy managers discover that the creation of new city projects, municipal plans, and governmental contracts requires their services. Energy managers may also be in charge of reducing the amount of energy and water used by creating projects that adhere to tight design guidelines, statutory requirements, and financial constraints. 10. Engineer in sustainability\nA sustainability engineer’s main responsibilities include developing strategies, evaluating locations, and studying financial data to create and implement renewable energy projects. Although Sustainability Jobs engineers often operate inside, they occasionally need to travel to certain job sites in order to effectively formulate task designs, comprehend necessary job specifications, and get more familiar with the project at hand. Many businesses provide Sustainability Jobs employment, which give the environment hope for a bright future. The prognosis for employment in sustainability will also continue to improve as the population continues to grow and businesses and organisation search for innovative methods to develop, manufacture, and utilise fuel resources in environmentally appropriate applications.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:53eea886-84c3-40a2-a0ba-7d6241685a5d>"]},{"passage":"Building managers work in many different environments, depending on their specific job placement.

As more organizations automate internal processes related to sustainability, EHS and energy management, asset management is another area that overlaps. Companies can expect more energy management features in asset management software and may, in some situations, be able to meet their needs with a single application rather than two. Energy management and asset management have different initial aims. Energy management seeks to reduce the energy cost of operating building and factory equipment and is typically the purview of the facilities, energy or operations team at the local, and increasingly, the corporate level. Asset management intends to avoid downtime of production lines and facilities and to save costs and is used by the facilities or operations team at the local level. Historically, energy management and asset management have been separate processes with separate software solutions. However, more teams are realizing a connection between energy management and asset management. Real-time energy consumption and other attribute monitoring can be used to detect problems with roof-top units (RTU) and other HVAC equipment, motors, and fans as well as to identify energy savings opportunities. Several companies now have their asset management team coordinate work with the energy management team. With real-time monitoring of equipment, operators aim to proactively recognize opportunities quickly and to apply preventive maintenance actions before responding to outright equipment failure. Both asset and energy management requires identifying assets, monitoring real-time equipment usage, and alerting operators of problems. Software vendors are responding to this emerging need. Traditional asset management vendors such as IBM\/Maximo and Infor have added initial energy management capabilities and energy management vendors who utilize interval data are adding basic asset management capabilities to their core products. A single software product for each process makes sense. A single master list of equipment (name plate info, age, drawings, etc.) can be used for both asset management and energy management. Proposed and completed maintenance and energy projects can be tracked in one system. Operators and facility managers will receive the same type of alerts and work orders for both maintenance and energy improvements. Such an approach doesn’t fit all situations and associated vendor capabilities are still nascent in many cases. But energy and maintenance leaders should monitor this trend and may find situations where it make sense to add light weight asset management to an energy management implementation or conversely to supplement an asset management deployment with energy monitoring capabilities.

The conventional wisdom is that the current softness in the economy has weakened demand for energy. Ultimately, the nation's energy infrastructure needs to be expanded and upgraded. Additional gas-fired energy plants will tax the gas distribution network, said Graham. A grim outlook\nSo what about the future? Veteran developer Dan Packard, founder and certified property manager of Denver-based PowerSpring, an Internet-based energy information application, is pessimistic. He believes property managers are too passive in seeking solutions for energy costs. Packard cites California's energy crisis as an example. “The West Coast energy issue has been beaten to death,” said Packard. “The expression there by property managers today is that Gov. Gray Davis has stepped in and solved the problem.” Many Americans incorrectly believe the energy crisis is over because the issue currently isn't heavily covered by the media, Packard added. Analysts say property managers across the country have not begun to implement energy solutions for their portfolios to stop the decline in FFO and net operating income attributable to energy costs. “At the present pace, it will be many years before they recognize the needs of their tenants,” Packard said. “Over this period, the best of tenants [those willing to pay the highest rents] will have moved on to other space that offers extensive menus of value-added services, including many energy options,” concluded Packard. “The property manager who is slow to react will be out of a job.”\nSome enlightening energy management tips\nEnergy costs don't always have to rise. Experts say they actually can decrease, if an efficient energy system is put in place. Here are some suggestions from Rob Bagguley, president of property and facilities management at Chicago-based Transwestern Commercial Services, and others to energize the thinking of a real estate owner, operator or manager:\nChill out. Install energy management systems that better control equipment, add efficiency and save power. Air conditioners, for instance, gobble up huge amounts of electricity. Most traditional commercial cooling systems, called chillers, operate during the day when rates are highest. Some property managers have sought to cut costs and conserve energy by running chiller systems during off-peak hours. Think differently. Does cleaning have to be done in the dead of night with different crews on different floors? Bagguley urges building owners to coordinate cleaning staffs. “It's a simple concept,” he explained. “Assemble crews on one floor, complete that floor and then have them move on to another. You'll finish a floor in a shorter time frame.”\nGo back to the basics. For example, if outdoor lighting is automated, use a digital clock that has more accurate timing and reflects changes in daylight-saving time to control the lighting. Turn lights on only when needed and off when they are not in use. Consider motion monitors that trigger the on switch when a person is in the office. Check out a building's equipment. Retrofit air conditioners with energy-efficient machines. Determine when power peaks. If owners or property managers can lower that peak demand, they will significantly affect their rate structure. Stagger times for equipment start-up and shutdown. Instead of using energy in a bell-shaped curve, where energy use starts out flat and then climbs rapidly before falling again, monitor energy usage. Consider alternate sources of power. Rather than obtaining 100% of power from a grid, consider using an on-site generator to control peak costs that could provide 25% to 50% of the energy needed at the site. Not only will such a system reduce costs, but it also could help in an emergency. Owners and operators also could opt for a hybrid system that combines electricity and gas. Take advantage of programs offered by utilities and energy manufacturers. In California and other states, energy companies offer rebate programs to entice owners to replace fluorescent light bulbs with lower-wattage bulbs, thereby creating significant savings. Lighting manufacturers typically offer financing, and the payback can be realized in less than two years. At the same time, tenants see the benefits of their conservation efforts. Get everyone involved with the program. The age of tenants is changing. Generation X is more concerned about energy conservation. Seek to make everyone more conservation-conscious not only from an economic viewpoint, but also from an environmental one. Work with tenants.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:26098a82-34b8-4731-93b6-3abf74a9a634>"]},{"passage":"What Are Energy Consultant Jobs\nWhat are Energy Consultant jobs? The position of an Energy Consultant is a new one in today’s business landscape and provides the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of a fast-changing industry. Overall, Energy Consultants are the specialists companies hire to reevaluate every aspect of energy usage within the organisation and seek solutions for making the company greener and more efficient. In a world where climate change has become a very real and pressing matter, companies are in a unique position to be catalysts for real change. By altering their consumption habits, businesses can set new precedents in their industries and begin the long road to reversing the rising tide of carbon emissions worldwide. Energy Consultants typically work for companies that run large-scale production facilities or manufacturing plants with high energy demands. But as the regulatory legislation becomes ever more stringent, the demand for energy consultation is extending into many fields and sectors. Energy Consultant Job Description\nThe job of an Energy Consultant spans a broad range of skills and areas of knowledge. Companies have an economic incentive to become more energy efficient, both because of potential tax benefits and also simply because the cost of energy is a significant expenditure for many businesses. So, Energy Consultants start by examining the usage patterns of the companies that hire them. The energy experts study all sources of energy the company has drawn from over the course of the past few years, investigate potential local and technological options for achieving greater efficiencies, and conduct feasibility studies to determine challenges to implementing green solutions, this might mean switching to solar or wind energy, for instance. Or it might mean upgrading inefficient machinery to newer models with greater efficiency. They typically work for large corporations, and so their studies often necessitate evaluating multi-step manufacturing or production processes that occur in multiple facilities that are geographically dispersed so the complexity of the energy consumption picture for a business is often incredibly complicated, necessitating careful study, thorough analysis, and creative problem solving. 5 Primary Responsibilities Of An Energy Consultant\n- Reduce Consumption: The ultimate goal of the profession is to examine every possible option for cutting usage, this might mean implementing new technology, reversing wasteful habits, or even altering manufacturing or production processes. - Increase Efficiency: Most often, increases in efficiency are achieved through the implementation of new technology or the transition to renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines. It is the consultant’s job to evaluate which options are best suited for the company in question. - Evaluate Systems: To institute greener systems and policies, an Energy Consultant must first painstakingly evaluate the usage demands of the current systems in place. These systems range from working hours to machinery to the energy awareness of employees, all of which fall under the purview of the consultant. - Map Usage: Many major corporations function through a complex system of interconnected facilities, shipping routes, offices, and warehouses. In many cases, these companies have never had a map of their total energy usage and have thus never been able to have a comprehensive picture of how and where the company consumes the most energy resources. - Provide Options: As with all consultant work, the duty of an EC is to provide as many actionable options as possible, with detailed explanations of the pros and cons and feasibility of each possibility, to help the company’s officers decide what and how to go about improving efficiency. 10 Day-to-Day Energy Consultancy Duties\n- Study current energy sources\n- Investigate alternate energy sources\n- Evaluate the company’s usage about regulatory requirements for the industry and proposed regulatory requirements expected in the future\n- Write concise, clear reports about findings and suggestions\n- Justify conclusions in meetings with executives\n- Meet with managers and employees to form a clear picture of consumption habits\n- Analyse data using data modelling software\n- Conduct feasibility studies\n- Brainstorm creative solutions to identified problems\n- Participate in routine visits to customers\nEnergy Consultant Salary\nThe average salary for an Energy Consultant in the UK is about £27,000 annually. Those in the upper echelons of the profession, however, can earn more than £50,000. Many Energy Consultants work on a contract basis, though there are also many full-time positions in the field.

Around 220 B.C., the emperor Shi Huangdi decided to build the Great Wall of China by closing the gaps between smaller walls built by earlier rulers. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were used as forced labor to build the Great Wall. The workers hauled and dumped millions of tons of rubble to fill the core of the wall. From the Yellow Sea in the east to the Gobi desert in the west, the Great Wall twisted and turned for thousands of miles, protecting and isolating China from the barbarian warriors beyond its borders. China's Early History\nChina is the world's oldest continuous civilization. The beginnings of that civilization extend back into the mists of prehistory. Because of China's geography—the long distances that separated it from Europe and other continents—it followed its own direction. EARLY CIVILIZATION AND THE DYNASTIES\nChina has been a settled society for more than 4,000 years. In its earliest days, China was made up of a number of Stone Age cultures. Then it was ruled by dynasties. A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family. The first Chinese dynasty was the Shang. This dynasty arose during the 1700s B.C. It ruled a central area in China for about 600 years until it was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled part of northern China. The next important dynasty, the Qin (chihn), gave its name to China. In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty united a number of smaller states under a strong central government and established an empire. The first Qin emperor was Shi Huangdi, the builder of the Great Wall. The Chinese empire, ruled by different dynasties, lasted for more than 2,000 years. Another important Chinese dynasty was that of the Han. These rulers pushed the empire into central Asia, home to many nomadic tribes. Many other dynasties followed over the centuries. In 1644, the Manchu people of Manchuria invaded China and established the Qing (chihng) Dynasty. In 1911, the Manchus were overthrown by revolutionaries, and this ended the dynasties and the Chinese empire. China Opens Up to the World\nEven though China remained isolated from other regions for centuries, that started to change in the 13th century. At that time, European travelers began to visit China. Marco Polo, for example, traveled from Venice, Italy, to China in the 13th century and wrote a book about his adventures, The Travels of Marco Polo. China and Europe had few contacts until the 19th century, when European powers sought access to Chinese markets. At that point, China had a weak military and an ineffective government. Europeans took advantage of China and forced it to sign a series of treaties that granted special privileges to the Europeans. Consequently, China was carved up into spheres of influence controlled by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. This outside control angered China, which burst forth in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Chinese militants attacked and killed Europeans and Chinese Christians in China. A multinational force of about 20,000 soldiers finally defeated the Boxers. REVOLUTION AND CHANGE\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Dynasty, founded by the Manchus, attempted to reform the Chinese government, but it was too late. Many individuals and groups wanted to form a republic, which would give the people a voice in their government. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. However, the republic, led by Sun Yat-sen, was undermined by civil war throughout China. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, a general named Chiang Kai-shek took over the Nationalist Party. Chiang's troops fought against the warlords of China and united most of the country in the 1920s. However, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party became an increasingly powerful force in China. The Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1949, the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, finally defeated the Nationalists.\n\nHistory 221 timeline part 3\nThe history of art is immense, the earliest cave paintings pre-date writing by almost 27,000 years if you’re interested in art history, the first thing you should.

A: Serendipity at age 14. At a Magnet High School in Minneapolis, merely by chance I took Chinese language from Margaret Wong, a pedagogic genius who convinced many of us that learning Chinese was urgently necessary, and easy. Teacher Wong's father had fought on the losing side of China's civil war in the 1940s, as a high-ranking Nationalist general close to Chiang Kai-shek. Her war stories from the 1940s mesmerized me, as did her anecdotes about growing up in a powerful household of wartime China, cosmopolitan Shanghai, and political Beijing. Despite Teacher Wong's Nationalist background, she developed strong ties with the new PRC, and thus our Chinese class managed to visit China in 1978, as guests of the Chinese government, six months before the US and China normalized relations in 1979. The only photo I have from that trip is following a basketball game we played with a school team in a mountain village. Our overnight in the mountains was unplanned; that day the military needed our hotel due to the eruption of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border. Following this 1978 trip, I stayed on in Hong Kong, studying language and history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My subsequent education at Stanford and Harvard was driven by an obsession with China and learning Chinese. I've been lucky, studying with some of the leading China scholars in the world, and studying intensive Chinese at the preeminent language centers in China and Taiwan. I've also enjoyed non-academic experiences in East Asia, such as acting in movies, helping produce the first Chinese-Japanese TV series, living in a village, on a farmer's roof next to his pigeon coop, and working as a runway model. Q: How long would it take to traverse the entire 3,600 miles of the Yangtze? What would one see of note upstream of the Three Gorges? A: Well, it could take months, as it did for the several million people who walked up the Yangtze from Shanghai to Chongqing, to escape the fighting during World War II. Regarding the historical significance of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, bear in mind that China's history, unlike Western history, occurred in a concentrated geographic area. The history of the west is spread out across half the globe, from Mesopotamia, the Mideast, the Mediterranean, Europe, and then North America. By contrast, China's historical experience occurred largely within the area of today's China. This means that China's equivalent of Abraham, Odysseus, Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Caesar, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, George Washington, and Teddy Roosevelt all lived within a relatively restricted geographical space, especially along China's great river systems. (This is also why the remarkable Terra Cotta warriors of the First Emperor were discovered by chance, by farmers digging a well). The earth is brimming with archeological riches and places such as the Three Gorges are bursting with historical memory and cultural significance. And the lessons of this area continue to excite the modern imagination. Take for example the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi), which describes in Homeric detail the adventures inside the Three Gorges of warriors such as Guan Gong (China's Achilles) and the ingenious military strategist Zhu Geliang. This exciting text informed the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao Zedong more than the writings of Marx and Lenin. The blockbuster film \"Red Cliff\" reinterpreted these dramas for the big screen. Recent archeological discoveries of the 'Sanxingdui' culture now posit a competing vision of early Chinese civilization, complicating the Yellow River's age-old claim as the China's \"cradle.\" The role of the Three Gorges in Tang poetry, Song painting, and Ming drama is profound. The Three Gorges are also visually stunning, as are the unspoiled nature reserves in adjacent tributaries feeding the Three Gorges. Finally, to come to terms with contemporary China, one must understand the Three Gorges Dam. Q: When Smithsonian travelers tour a traditional, perhaps millennium old, Beijing \"hutong\" or neighborhood, what should they be especially aware of? Architecture? Layout? Location relative to the Forbidden City?\n\nTwo people that I met in China died recently. Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.\n\nThus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its \"modern form.\" Zuo writes: \"Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. \"55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a \"second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '\"57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: \"Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. \"58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: \"Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. \"59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter \"modern.\" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along \"two basic tracks.\" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. \"Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,\" he notes, \"oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. \"60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field's [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies. Some of the more troubling implications are discussed in the following section.

I expressed a similar confusion about the state of oral history in Canada a few years ago by describing it as a paradox: while the oral history movement seemed to be in a steady decline, an ever-increasing number of researchers were doing oral history without identifying themselves as oral historians or viewing their work as oral history. See Alexander Freund, \"Oral History in Canada: A Paradox,\" in Canada in Grainau: A Multidisciplinary Survey after 30 Years \/ Le Canada a Grainau: un survol multidisciplinaire 30 ans après, eds. Klaus-Dieter Ertler and Hartmut Lutz (Frankfurt am Main, DE: Peter Lang, 2009), 305–335. Even for the US, we know little about the research conducted in the US military, the presidential libraries, and by community researchers not connected to universities. 14.

Whether it is the Federal Writers' Project in the United States in the 1930s, Allan Nevins's project at Columbia University, or the projects that emerged in Great Britain, Italy, and West Germany in the 1970s, none seems to have rooted itself in nineteenth-century models of interviewing that sociologists, ethnographers, journalists, and social reformers developed. 26.

The Taiwanese oral historian Chu Hongyuan (also from the Academia Sinica, like Hu Shih) confirmed with me this apparently longer history of oral history in Taiwan during my own visit. Taiwan's oral history initiatives, however, seemed to have had no effect on China, which was going through the turmoil of Mao's reforms. Similarly, the extensive work of the Oral History Centre at the National Archives of Singapore, which has been conducting oral histories since the 1960s, seems to have had no major impact on the earlier development of oral history in China.

Hundreds of thousands of peasants were used as forced labor to build the Great Wall. The workers hauled and dumped millions of tons of rubble to fill the core of the wall. From the Yellow Sea in the east to the Gobi desert in the west, the Great Wall twisted and turned for thousands of miles, protecting and isolating China from the barbarian warriors beyond its borders. China's Early History\nChina is the world's oldest continuous civilization. The beginnings of that civilization extend back into the mists of prehistory. Because of China's geography—the long distances that separated it from Europe and other continents—it followed its own direction. EARLY CIVILIZATION AND THE DYNASTIES\nChina has been a settled society for more than 4,000 years. In its earliest days, China was made up of a number of Stone Age cultures. Then it was ruled by dynasties. A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family. The first Chinese dynasty was the Shang. This dynasty arose during the 1700s B.C. It ruled a central area in China for about 600 years until it was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled part of northern China. The next important dynasty, the Qin (chihn), gave its name to China. In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty united a number of smaller states under a strong central government and established an empire. The first Qin emperor was Shi Huangdi, the builder of the Great Wall. The Chinese empire, ruled by different dynasties, lasted for more than 2,000 years. Another important Chinese dynasty was that of the Han. These rulers pushed the empire into central Asia, home to many nomadic tribes. Many other dynasties followed over the centuries. In 1644, the Manchu people of Manchuria invaded China and established the Qing (chihng) Dynasty. In 1911, the Manchus were overthrown by revolutionaries, and this ended the dynasties and the Chinese empire. China Opens Up to the World\nEven though China remained isolated from other regions for centuries, that started to change in the 13th century. At that time, European travelers began to visit China. Marco Polo, for example, traveled from Venice, Italy, to China in the 13th century and wrote a book about his adventures, The Travels of Marco Polo. China and Europe had few contacts until the 19th century, when European powers sought access to Chinese markets. At that point, China had a weak military and an ineffective government. Europeans took advantage of China and forced it to sign a series of treaties that granted special privileges to the Europeans. Consequently, China was carved up into spheres of influence controlled by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. This outside control angered China, which burst forth in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Chinese militants attacked and killed Europeans and Chinese Christians in China. A multinational force of about 20,000 soldiers finally defeated the Boxers. REVOLUTION AND CHANGE\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Dynasty, founded by the Manchus, attempted to reform the Chinese government, but it was too late. Many individuals and groups wanted to form a republic, which would give the people a voice in their government. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. However, the republic, led by Sun Yat-sen, was undermined by civil war throughout China. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, a general named Chiang Kai-shek took over the Nationalist Party. Chiang's troops fought against the warlords of China and united most of the country in the 1920s. However, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party became an increasingly powerful force in China. The Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1949, the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, finally defeated the Nationalists.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:66cb3526-7f58-4c0f-a904-c7c1bcb5cd8f>"]},{"passage":"History 221 timeline part 3\nThe history of art is immense, the earliest cave paintings pre-date writing by almost 27,000 years if you’re interested in art history, the first thing you should.

A: Serendipity at age 14. At a Magnet High School in Minneapolis, merely by chance I took Chinese language from Margaret Wong, a pedagogic genius who convinced many of us that learning Chinese was urgently necessary, and easy. Teacher Wong's father had fought on the losing side of China's civil war in the 1940s, as a high-ranking Nationalist general close to Chiang Kai-shek. Her war stories from the 1940s mesmerized me, as did her anecdotes about growing up in a powerful household of wartime China, cosmopolitan Shanghai, and political Beijing. Despite Teacher Wong's Nationalist background, she developed strong ties with the new PRC, and thus our Chinese class managed to visit China in 1978, as guests of the Chinese government, six months before the US and China normalized relations in 1979. The only photo I have from that trip is following a basketball game we played with a school team in a mountain village. Our overnight in the mountains was unplanned; that day the military needed our hotel due to the eruption of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border. Following this 1978 trip, I stayed on in Hong Kong, studying language and history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My subsequent education at Stanford and Harvard was driven by an obsession with China and learning Chinese. I've been lucky, studying with some of the leading China scholars in the world, and studying intensive Chinese at the preeminent language centers in China and Taiwan. I've also enjoyed non-academic experiences in East Asia, such as acting in movies, helping produce the first Chinese-Japanese TV series, living in a village, on a farmer's roof next to his pigeon coop, and working as a runway model. Q: How long would it take to traverse the entire 3,600 miles of the Yangtze? What would one see of note upstream of the Three Gorges? A: Well, it could take months, as it did for the several million people who walked up the Yangtze from Shanghai to Chongqing, to escape the fighting during World War II. Regarding the historical significance of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, bear in mind that China's history, unlike Western history, occurred in a concentrated geographic area. The history of the west is spread out across half the globe, from Mesopotamia, the Mideast, the Mediterranean, Europe, and then North America. By contrast, China's historical experience occurred largely within the area of today's China. This means that China's equivalent of Abraham, Odysseus, Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Caesar, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, George Washington, and Teddy Roosevelt all lived within a relatively restricted geographical space, especially along China's great river systems. (This is also why the remarkable Terra Cotta warriors of the First Emperor were discovered by chance, by farmers digging a well). The earth is brimming with archeological riches and places such as the Three Gorges are bursting with historical memory and cultural significance. And the lessons of this area continue to excite the modern imagination. Take for example the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi), which describes in Homeric detail the adventures inside the Three Gorges of warriors such as Guan Gong (China's Achilles) and the ingenious military strategist Zhu Geliang. This exciting text informed the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao Zedong more than the writings of Marx and Lenin. The blockbuster film \"Red Cliff\" reinterpreted these dramas for the big screen. Recent archeological discoveries of the 'Sanxingdui' culture now posit a competing vision of early Chinese civilization, complicating the Yellow River's age-old claim as the China's \"cradle.\" The role of the Three Gorges in Tang poetry, Song painting, and Ming drama is profound. The Three Gorges are also visually stunning, as are the unspoiled nature reserves in adjacent tributaries feeding the Three Gorges. Finally, to come to terms with contemporary China, one must understand the Three Gorges Dam.

Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0cf1f3cb-a0bb-477b-b15c-2f956a015ec7>"]},{"passage":"Thus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its \"modern form.\" Zuo writes: \"Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. \"55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a \"second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '\"57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: \"Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. \"58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: \"Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. \"59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter \"modern.\" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along \"two basic tracks.\" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. \"Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,\" he notes, \"oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. \"60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field's [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies. Some of the more troubling implications are discussed in the following section.

Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years. Eat Bajan Day this year is on October 9. This is managed by the Graham Gooding Trust of which I am a Trustee. Quite a lot has rubbed off from these experiences and if I do not know any specific detail in agriculture at least I know who to ask. My primary interest is in shepherding businesses to sustainable success. Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea\/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks – 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society’s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks – 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets.\n\nHurricane Season 2019: Uncertain Future for Over 70% of Latin American Livestock Producers\nAccording to the World Veterinary Association, more than 70% of the world’s most impoverished communities depend on livestock for milk, meat, eggs and income. Author: Dr. Juan Carlos Murillo, International Response Manager. World Animal Protection\nAs it happens every year, the month of June means the official beginning of the hurricane season in the Atlantic-Caribbean Region, and although fewer significant hurricanes are expected this year, this does not mean that their severity will be less. To tell the truth, this is not only a seasonal climatic phenomenon, but it is the sum of many social, political, economic, cultural, and a wide range of other factors, which create conditions that hit on livelihoods and directly on animal welfare. These factors are even more harmful than the mere impact of heavy rains, floods, and the destruction of road infrastructure and productive. Worrying figures on the impact of hurricanes in the agriculture and farming sectors\nLast year, after the landfall of hurricanes Irma and Maria, most countries in the Caribbean suffered a severe impact in their economies, leading to an almost complete halt as a consequence of the destruction of roads, bridges, and public utility systems. A significant example of this impact is the agriculture in Dominica, which was devastated, up to a 100% loss of crops and substantial destruction to productive trees and death of livestock. Another example is Antigua and Barbuda, where the combined value of destroyed assets and disruptions in the production of goods and services is equivalent to about 9% of the country’s GDP in 2016. Although authorities, together with local animal protection groups and owners, are delivering food, primary veterinary care and even rehoming to animals left behind in this island; Barbuda remains uninhabitable, and permanent returns will not be possible until water and sanitation supplies are restored. Although the economy in the British Virgin Islands, relies mostly on tourism, there is a significant but undetermined number of pets and backyard animals, which were severely affected, due to the extensive damage -approximately 95% of all small coastal properties on the northern and western section on the island of Tortola destroyed or reported severe deterioration. Public services and transport activities in most of the territories were severely hampered, including secondary roads, which are critical to access arable land, remote locations and transport labour and agricultural products to markets and ports. In summary, as part of Irma and Maria impact, over USD $ 5 Billion is required to fulfill the recovery needs for Dominica, Barbuda, and the British Virgin Islands. Building back better\nMost of the injuries and deaths of animals during hurricanes are caused by flying debris, drowning or by being swept away by flash floods or strong winds. To avoid this impact on livestock is vital to leave the animals outside, so they will have more chances to survive, and after stress, they will need clean feed, a dry and safe place to stand, and clean water. Also, support with electrolytes and vitamins will help them in returning to normal. Younger animals are more susceptible to stress than older animals and may need more care. Having said that, as most damage to buildings, pens, and animals comes from wind and flying objects, the ability to protect them in advance from these dangers dramatically reduces the chance of injury to livestock.For this reason, it is essential to build or rebuild reinforced and wind-resistant structures, located away from floods’ path, implementing pre-hurricane evacuation plans and training animals for secure evacuation procedures. We, at World Animal Protection’s Animals in Disasters programme, understand and share the suffering of thousands of animals affected by hurricanes. In an attempt to deliver hope to their owners in distress, we offer preparedness information, case studies and catalyzing solutions through our website www.animalsindisasters.org, where resources like the online course PrepVet can be found, which provides general information on Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change, Emergency Management, and Animal Welfare. Please visit our site, prepare an emergency plan, and #don’tForgetThem.\n\nThe Caribbean Community is transforming its agricultural sector into a competitive and sustainable system of agricultural production and services in which ICTs will play a vital role. Agriculture is a priority sector for the 20 member and associate Member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Their vision for the agricultural sector entails a complete transformation towards a market‐oriented, internationally competitive and environmentally sound system of agricultural production and services – one that provides improved food and nutrition security, especially for vulnerable groups. ICTs and their many applications can play a vital role in realising this ambitious vision. This vision has been set down in a number of policy documents, such as the Community Agriculture Policy, the Regional Food and Nutrition Security Policy and several supporting strategic policy frameworks, such as the Agribusiness Strategic Plan. One of the key imperatives of these policies is the adoption of modern knowledge and information systems to improve decision making and encourage interaction among all players in the value chain. These systems should also link R&D and extension efforts at the national, regional and international levels, and attempt to increase their impact on the entire agricultural sector in terms of adaptation of ICTs and other technology advances. Bridging information gaps\nA key challenge faced by farmers and agribusinesses is a lack of knowledge about markets, sources of technology and business support. ICTs could be used to fill these information gaps. For example, cellular networks and value-added services that can be accessed through these networks, have spread throughout the entire world. The speed of this diffusion and the variety of uses to which these networks have been put is indicative of the pent-up demand for more rapid and effective communication, even in the smallest and poorest communities. Market information gaps exist even within internal markets in the Caribbean region. The building of market information systems is therefore critical to ensuring that farmers and agribusiness persons are able to make the right decisions, plan ahead and link up with the necessary markets. Linking producers to regional and external markets means setting up robust market information and intelligence systems, which must be funded largely by the public sector. Crucial to this issue is the need for ICTs to gather, store and analyse, and subsequently disseminate information. Traditional extension services depend very much on there being a sufficient number of trained technicians to service a manageable number of farmers, and that those workers have the required budgets to do their work properly, even in remote villages. These extension services, if they ever existed, will probably become a thing of the past. There now is a critical need to build up digital databanks and translate technical information into user-friendly advice that can be accessed by farmers and agribusiness persons. The CARICOM region’s limited progress in the field is probably best illustrated by the sporadic presence of governments, regional institutions, NGOs and even established businesses on the web. These websites consist mostly of static web pages and are often short of relevant information and often lack the essential tools for communicating, doing business and engaging in national and regional dialogues. Innovative ICT initiatives\nNotwithstanding the many challenges, there are some encouraging innovative developments specific to ICTs in the Caribbean. For instance, at the policy level, the CARICOM member states recently approved a Regional Digital Development Strategy which is a modern strategy seeking to capitalise on existing national initiatives and amplify them for regional benefit. Additionally, funding has been acquired from the EU-funded Intra-ACP Agricultural Policy Programme to reinvigorate the development of a regional agricultural marketing information and intelligence system, and work has started to develop the necessary capacity for such a system, at both regional and national levels. National initiatives include Trinidad & Tobago’s National Agricultural Marketing and Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO), which has a mandate to improve marketing and investment in the country’s agro-industrial sector. NAMDEVCO has developed a National Agricultural Market Information System (NAMIS) which provides reliable and real-time information to farmers, processors, retailers and institutional buyers. Among the many innovations introduced by NAMIS is the use of hand-held devices for capturing data, which reduces the errors normally associated with data collection. Another national initiative is the government-operated Jamaica Agricultural Marketing Information System (JAMIS), which provides regular updates on over 50 agricultural products. JAMIS provides weekly updates on prices, availability and quality of agricultural produce on its website, where visitors can subscribe to a service that sends these reports to them by email.\n\nVarious other innovative mobile applications are emerging in the academic world and through the work of private developers. These applications range from providing safety and weather information, to linking fishermen at sea with buyers for their catches. Others provide ‘real-time’ key information for specific fruit trees throughout the year. Meanwhile, the CARICOM Secretariat has created a Caribbean Agribusiness website with an ambitious agenda. This website is meant, eventually, to be a major internet portal integrating existing initiatives and relevant institutions, such as ministries of agriculture, producer organisations, agribusiness associations and inter-governmental organisations, to name a few, and serving as the hub for all matters in which business persons (at all scales of operation) have an interest – up-to-date information, statistics, trade and investment opportunities and policy issues. Caribbean Agribusiness is also meant to fill the information gap that currently exists in terms of all sorts of agricultural information but is not meant to replace or supersede any existing information service. The importance of embracing ICTs by the CARICOM’s agricultural sector cannot be overstated. Both public sector institutions and the private sector have to show leadership if the mandates to increase production and promote trade and food security are to be met. We have to explicitly recognise the role that ICTs play in the practical lives of producers and consumers alike and build on best practices within and outside of the region, and we must mainstream ICT-related activities into the various institutions’ ongoing programmes. Since every business, country and region depends on the flow of knowledge – from production processes through to marketing techniques and the sale and purchase of goods via the internet – investing, or the lack of it – in ICTs can have a ‘make or break’ effect on the ability of CARICOM to remain a viable, sought-after partner in the global agriculture arena.

I am Mr. Lester Johnson , the proud owner of the Everland farm located on Johnson Road right here on the island of Long Island. I firstly became involved in farming when my parents and grandparents would take me to our farm on most weekends to help out by doing various duties which included collecting the chicken eggs, milking the cows, and feeding all the animals. I eventually came to realize that farming was the perfect source to support myself and my family but over the years it has grown to more than just that. As a farmer I have been able to not only aid in the accommodation of the key necessities for the residents of the Bahamas but I have also subsidized to the deterioration of the five million dollar import deficit (reported by The Guardian in 2012). I have so for been a farmer for the past twelve years and in this business owned a commercial farm. Commercial farming is farming that provides products for sale and subsistence farming provides enough food for the farmer and his family but not enough for sale (both derived from Dictionary.com). In order to become a farmer the land in which you plan to grow on must first be acquired, the products that you plan on rearing whether it is livestock or crops, workers and machinery must also be in place. Farming has facilitated the job market of the Bahamas as it is able to hire individuals such as Naturalist, Food Chemist, Food Technician and Irrigation Engineer. As a mean to support farmers with the many expenses the government has provided them with some incentives these include the exemption from customs duty on specific items and the reduction of duty on specific items, the store credit program, small business loans and the exemptions of water use charges. An incentive is something that motivates or encourages someone to do something (stated by Oxford Dictionary). One of the premier initiatives provided by the government was the exemption and reduction on the Bahamas custom duty for specific items, this was an incentive put in place to let farmers pay little to no money on imported materials, machinery and requirements needed for quality crops and livestock. An exemption is the process of freeing or state of being free from an obligation or liability imposed on others (Dictionary.com). The exemption of customs duty would assist farmers in numerous ways, customs duty is a payment levied on the import, export, manufactured or sale goods (Oxford Dictionary). By being concluded from such a charge we farmers will not only be able to hire more adept experienced workers such as much needed agronomist but also use money not spent on the expenditure of their farms. We are given incentives on products such as hatching eggs and livestock and cattle which would exert or give other farmers the opportunity to venture into different crops. Farmers do not have to deal with various charges on farm equipment and machinery such as harvesters, materials used for the construction of green houses and feeding systems as the immunity lowers the cost on imported machinery. This has reinforced the government by causing them not to target so much on import and export bills because farmers like me would be able to have more of the crops that we used than to waste money on importing which will result in a lower cost on crops, allowing the money to continuously be pumped back into the economy. The exemption of customs duty on varied items for local farmers will not only assist in boosting the Bahamian economy but the farming industry as well. The government has then accommodated the initiative of stores on the credit program like farm and fish stores, farming input such as seed and fertilizer which concedes farmers to be paid prior to the crops being produced. They are given a credit of out of a certain lump sum of money for every acre of land that they own. The credit system is a system which allows workers to be paid before their work begins (Dictionary.com).The farmer would use this money to aid the outlying cultivation and development of his farm, as did I quiet some years ago. To be eligible for such a program a farmer must be a resident of the Bahamas and they must fill out an application at the Ministry of Agriculture. This initiative has assisted me as a farmer because the advances given to me can go towards the prosperity of my farm like crops, seeds, machinery and it also assists with the salary of my workers.\n\n- 1 How much does farming contribute to the economy? - 2 How did farming affect the economy? - 3 How big is the farming industry in the UK? - 4 How do farmers help the economy? - 5 What type of farmers make the most money? - 6 Why are farmers still poor? - 7 What negative effects does agriculture have on the environment? - 8 Are most farmers poor? - 9 Are UK farmers rich? - 10 How much do farmers make per acre UK? - 11 How much money do farmers make UK? - 12 Why are farmers important to society? - 13 Why is farming important to America? - 14 What are advantages of farming? How much does farming contribute to the economy? Agriculture, food, and related industries contributed $1.109 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, a 5.2-percent share. The output of America’s farms contributed $136.1 billion of this sum—about 0.6 percent of GDP. How did farming affect the economy? Agriculture and its related industries (things like food sales and other industries that wouldn’t exist or would be much smaller without agriculture ) contribute $1.05 trillion to U.S. GDP, according to the latest data. That puts agriculture’s contribution to the overall economy at about 6 percent. How big is the farming industry in the UK? The total area of agricultural holdings is about 23.07 million acres (9.34 million hectares), of which about a third are arable and most of the rest is grassland. During the growing season about half the arable area is cereal crops, and of the cereal crop area, more than 65% is wheat. How do farmers help the economy? America’s farmers and ranchers make an important contribution to the U.S. economy by ensuring a safe and reliable food supply, improving energy security and supporting job growth and economic development. What type of farmers make the most money? Though soybeans are the most profitable crop for large farms, fruit trees and berries generate the most profit of all farm sizes. As farm size increases, labor costs to tend and harvest fruit trees and berries become too high to maintain profits. Berries often produce multiple harvests in one growing season. Why are farmers still poor? In most places, however, land is scarce and incentives for good resource management are absent; soils are being depleted, holdings are shrinking and farmers are sliding deeper into poverty. What negative effects does agriculture have on the environment? Many critical environmental issues are tied to agriculture, such as climate change, dead zones, genetic engineering, pollutants, deforestation, soil degradation, waste, and many others. Deforestation is a big side effect of agriculture that greatly impacts our planet and the environment. Are most farmers poor? Agricultural poverty is not a new problem, it is a resurgent problem. The Farm Poverty Problem in America Today: According to the USDA, in 2018 the majority of farmers in America instead of earning money, had negative income. Median farm income for U.S. farm households was $-1,553. Are UK farmers rich? The market in the UK favours large farms over smaller units, and due to the capital costs involved, small farmers are often forced to use the larger farmers ‘ or contractors’ machinery to cultivate their land. Yes, they are rich or poor – like a lot of French farmers. How much do farmers make per acre UK? Overall, this meant average net farm income rose from £31 to £66 per acre while average farm profit margins grew by £27 per acre. Farm gross margin across the whole area farmed rose to £280 per acre. How much money do farmers make UK? Overall the average annual salary for people who work on farms is £25,578 – close to the national UK figure of £26,500. More than 30% earned between £20,000 and £30,000, but more than one in 10 (13%) reported they earned less than £10,000, which suggests they were either part-time or working as family labour. Why are farmers important to society? Farmers hold the backbone of the agricultural system. As it is common knowledge that for a country to progress the gross domestic product should be reasonable, agriculture is one of the important parts. The agricultural system will only run if there are crops being grown and harvested, so this where farmers come in. Why is farming important to America?\n\nConsultant’s role: Because the young farmer is not familiar with technology or is in a technological slump, the consultant plays the role of a “demonstrator” who physically demonstrates harvesting techniques at every step. This will increase the young farmer’s confidence in his harvest and earning. Case background: Because Mr. C does not have adequate knowledge and has issues with obtaining farmlands, the team suggests Mr. C to intern at the consultant’s farm in preparation for future business plans while learning relative skills and looking for appropriate farmlands. Consultant’s role: The consultant plays the role of a “coach” who assists and offers the young farmer an agricultural operation blueprint of his own by allowing an internship opportunity at the consultant’s farm. Visits and Cross-field Cooperation\nCase background: After joining the project advisory program, Mr. D and his consultant review both successful and failed cases of agricultural startup farmers and share his thoughts and opinions with other young farmers. Consultant’s role: The consultant serves as a “guide” who uses successful and failed cases to let young farmers understand the success and failure behind each story. The consultant also utilizes group discussion to lead young farmers into thinking whether there are any possible improvements to be made regarding their own operations. Sales Channel Expansion\nCase background: There are two cases to discuss. For Mr. E, he has stable agricultural production and aspires to learn sales. He first collaborates with the consultant’s existing sales channel, expands his sales channels, and then slowly develops his own business model and corresponding sales channels. For Mr. F, he has developed his own e-commerce platform and shares it with his consultant; they are partners in expanding sales channels. Consultant’s role: The consultant serves as both a “collaborator” and a “business partner.” To increase the young farmer’s confidence and stabilize the farmer’s basic income, the consultant promises to purchase all of the young farmer’s produce during the period of consultation. This process lets the young farmer establish and develop his own sales channel. Moreover, the consultant collaborates with young farmers in using e-commerce platforms to sell agricultural products while discussing methods on sales, becoming business partners in the process. Case background: Mr. G is unable to completely dictate his finance, human resource management, and mode of operation due to conflicts with senior owners within the family either due to owners’ non-acceptance of the young farmer’s operating methods or because senior owners have yet to relinquish control of the firm. Consultant’s role: The consultant plays the role of a “mediator” that establishes a positive image for the young farmer before the current owners. The consultant will convey the young farmer’s idea and merits to the senior owners within the family and convince the owners to allow the young farmer to partake in some areas of operations. The consultant will lead the young farmer in small projects, yield excellent produce, and help the young farmer earn the senior owners’ respect. Table of Young Farmer Case Type and Consultant’s Role\n|Types of Cases||Roll of the Consultant|\n|Demonstrative Teaching||Role of a “demonstrator”|\n|On-site Education||Role of a “coach”|\n|Visits and Cross-field Cooperation||Role of a “guide”|\n|Sales Channel Expansion||Role of a “collaborator” and a “business partner”|\n|Generation Gap||Role of a “mediator”|\nSource: Compiled from this article\nBy examining the role of consultants through various case studies, we learned that the role of a consultant aligns with the sources, that is, to provide operation advice to transparentize information and lead young farmers to have sustainable production and operation. In response to the agricultural policies of the Council of Agriculture (COA) of Executive Yuan, we advocate for a multi-faceted agricultural policy that heeds both domestic agricultural grower and its corresponding supportive industry’s growth that will develop our traditional “Production Agriculture” into “New-value-chain Agriculture.” The project will categorize types of counseling cases through the value chain, providing strategies according to different types of problems.\n\nConsumers today are faced with a changing world, both through technology and public opinion. As the consuming public becomes more interested in techniques used in the production of the food and fiber they demand, the agriculturist must necessarily become more involved in public relations. As Charles Blatz so eloquently points out in his book, Ethics and Agriculture: An anthology on current issues in world context :\nAgriculture is changing around the world. The most dramatic of these changes threaten the very ability of humanity to produce the food needed to sustain itself. Yes, we are producing more on less land with less human effort, but some of our methods deteriorate the resources to such an extent that the production lives of many important agricultural areas can be numbered, not in centuries, but in decades ( Blatz, 1991, p. 1 ). As the world views agricultural issues in a new light, the consuming public has become more interested in production techniques ( Elliot & Olson, 1995 ). Consumers also have become actively involved in the management of public lands. Across the western United States, as well as the entire nation, recreation and tourism have become major sources of income to both individuals and state governments. Less than two percent of the population is involved in production agriculture ( American Farm Bureau, 1997 ). However, 100 percent of the population is involved in the consumption of agricultural products. Ethical issues pervade daily operations in all phases of the agricultural industry. Vice-President, Al Gore eludes to these concerns throughout his book Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit . \"Today, we enthusiastically participate in what is in essence a massive and unprecedented experiment with the natural systems of the global environment, with little regard for the moral consequence\" ( Gore, 1993 ). This quote follows a dissertation comparing the atrocities of Hitler and Stalin to the environmental destruction on the planet that society tolerates. Review of Relevant Literature\nOther professional and educational areas have identified numerous attempts to incorporate ethical issues into a variety of curricula. Bundy (1995) reported on an experiment by the University of California at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law to include a professional responsibility course in the first-year curriculum. Conclusions drawn from the study showed that due to the emphasis on the mastery of conventional legal analysis, student interest in professional responsibility may be ambivalent. There was no report on the continuation of the course. Stevens and Allen (1996) noted the ethical principles to be taught must be consistent with those in the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and its interpretations by the United States Supreme Court. Another profession with opportunities to deal with ethical issues surfaces in the field of medicine. A study, that utilized patient-led discussions in a genetics course to increase interaction of sensitive issues between patients and professionals, emphasized the unity of science, medicine and humanism through the problems and solutions offered by genetics ( Williamson, 1996 ). Few areas in agriculture have gone untouched by the debate over ethical issues. Ethical questions and issues have evolved in areas encompassing topics ranging from livestock show ring ethics to the use of animals in research laboratories. Other issues addressed range from control of natural resources and public lands to long-term effects of genetically altered food supplies. As these ethical questions have inundated agricultural professionals, the question for the agriculturist becomes one of responsibility. Agricultural education professionals need to become more and more proficient in the area of communication. In 1995 Jim Olsen and Jack Elliot completed a study that identified agricultural and environmental issues as seen by Arizona consumers. The implications of their study suggest that portraying an accurate message about agriculture is essential for the future of the country. Future generations of agriculturists will be faced with difficult ethical agricultural issues and will need to be prepared to deal with solving those problems. Dewey and Tuft's Ethics (1932) describes ethics as a science that deals with conduct. In their discussion on attempts at solving moral problems, Dewey writes about the scientific attempt to establish \"an order of judgments such that each one when made is of use in determining other judgments thereby securing control of their formation.\" (cited by Campbell, 1995). The art and science of problem solving has long been a focal point and instructional technique area for many agricultural education departments across the country.\n\nJamaica needs many more Barclay Ewarts to drive a manufacturing renaissance\nIN his tribute to Barclay Ewart, his friend, legendary entrepreneur Danny Williams, described the young Barclay Ewart as a modest person, who, despite his outstanding achievements in the field of sports, never let it go to his head. He was however \"determined to achieve his goals and worked assiduously at them, but was never unduly aggressive or vulgar in his efforts to do so\". Williams described him as \"true nationalist\", \"entrepreneur\" and most importantly \"a true industrialist\". If we look quickly at Ewart's background, he went abroad to Notre Dame University in the US to study chemical engineering on a track scholarship, switched to a degree in business administration, and when he came back to Jamaica took a job as a salesman with National Cash Register Company, selling office equipment and business machines. Such a background would seem the ideal preparation to become a serial industrial entrepreneur, involved in multiple businesses, which in Ewart's case included Tanners Jamaica, which he founded, Alkali Limited, Industrial Chemicals, Power & Tractors, and Leder Mode. More importantly, the ability to create new industries, or take old industries to another level, is the crucial element missing in job creation in Jamaica. The unfortunate fact is that it is not struggling entrepreneurs of necessity, creating limited value-added through buying and selling, that is going to drive job creation in Jamaica. It is only through entrepreneurs of opportunity, which an older generation might typically have called industrialists, such as Mr. Ewart, setting up new value-added industries in manufacturing, that will see the creation of the jobs Jamaica needs. Williams noted that he had lent Ewart what would have then been a significant sum of 5,000 pounds (he stressed he was repaid) to buy a stake in the company of which he was managing director, namely, Industrial Chemicals. The issue of the mobilisation of capital for industry remains a critical problem in Jamaica, an issue that I have tried to address in my online paper \"A new approach to development banking in Jamaica\". Such capital needs to be patient capital. As Williams notes, Ewart \"was not only interested in short-term gains. He was quite willing to invest his time and money in long term projects.\" Only a long-term approach can create new manufacturing industries, allowing Ewart (and so many others) to achieve his wish \"to help Jamaica become a better place for all Jamaicans to live in\". Williams noted that when he became minister of industry and commerce in the late 1970's, he asked Barclay to be the Chairman of the then Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC), which he accepted. It is worth noting that the JIDC's mandate, when it was created in the 1950's, included industrial development, provision of factory space, engineering services, food technology, industrial training and investment facilitation, amongst other things. Compared to today, at first glance, this appears much more of a one-stop shop for industry. Jdic, and some of its functions, were eventually subsumed into JAMPRO. According to Williams, when Ewart was a senator in 1989 to 1993, he made one of the most far reaching analysis of the industrial development required in Jamaica at a budget debate. His particular focus was the government's energy policy. As Williams puts it, \"He could not understand why the powers that be could not realise that the only sensible alternative was to turn to coal as our source of fuel to produce electricity. After all, wasn't America producing some 70% of its electricity from coal\", a debate which continues, despite Mr. Ewart having made his first report on this issue around 1980, as he observed at an Observer luncheon in 2009. Last Tuesday evening, immediately before Ewart's funeral, local broker Stocks and Securities limited had a forum appropriately entitled \"Manufacturing in Jamaica, Small and Medium Enterprises.\" The first presenter, Krishna Vaswani, described how, after moving back to Jamaica in 2004 (with a science background), rather than go into the family trading business, he made the difficult decision to go into manufacturing in Jamaica. In his case, he revived a piece of an old dormant factory, namely that of the formerly listed old West Indies Pulp and Paper business, to go into the manufacturing of toilet paper under the corporate name of Quality Incorporation.","passages":[{"passage":"It is with an exceedingly profound sense of regret and utter sorrow that the Ministry of Agriculture in Grenada has learnt of the recent passing of Mr Ricky Allport, a senior agricultural officer in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dominica. We are painfully aware of the tremendous loss to the agricultural sector and indeed to Dominica as a whole as a result of the passing of this distinguished and very accomplished agricultural officer. His outstanding and immense contribution to agriculture development in Dominica , the Windward Islands and the Caribbean region is well acknowledged. Many officers from the Ministry of Agriculture in Grenada have met and have interacted with Mr. Allport over the years in countless meetings, workshops, training sessions etc. and they are all unanimously in agreement that he has always stood out as a vivacious, high energetic, exceptionally knowledgeable and keen contributor to every discussion that he has been involved in.

Now, we wish that the youthful energy in the new Cabinet of the twin island nation infuses the entire Caribbean. This is indeed a gargantuan task but let us make a start with the agricultural sector. People are our most important resource and have to be fed. Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years. Eat Bajan Day this year is on October 9. This is managed by the Graham Gooding Trust of which I am a Trustee. Quite a lot has rubbed off from these experiences and if I do not know any specific detail in agriculture at least I know who to ask. My primary interest is in shepherding businesses to sustainable success. Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea\/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks – 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society’s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks – 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:33fc80d5-dcdd-4ff6-97d5-2e47fb4103af>"]},{"passage":"Hurricane Season 2019: Uncertain Future for Over 70% of Latin American Livestock Producers\nAccording to the World Veterinary Association, more than 70% of the world’s most impoverished communities depend on livestock for milk, meat, eggs and income. Author: Dr. Juan Carlos Murillo, International Response Manager. World Animal Protection\nAs it happens every year, the month of June means the official beginning of the hurricane season in the Atlantic-Caribbean Region, and although fewer significant hurricanes are expected this year, this does not mean that their severity will be less. To tell the truth, this is not only a seasonal climatic phenomenon, but it is the sum of many social, political, economic, cultural, and a wide range of other factors, which create conditions that hit on livelihoods and directly on animal welfare. These factors are even more harmful than the mere impact of heavy rains, floods, and the destruction of road infrastructure and productive. Worrying figures on the impact of hurricanes in the agriculture and farming sectors\nLast year, after the landfall of hurricanes Irma and Maria, most countries in the Caribbean suffered a severe impact in their economies, leading to an almost complete halt as a consequence of the destruction of roads, bridges, and public utility systems. A significant example of this impact is the agriculture in Dominica, which was devastated, up to a 100% loss of crops and substantial destruction to productive trees and death of livestock. Another example is Antigua and Barbuda, where the combined value of destroyed assets and disruptions in the production of goods and services is equivalent to about 9% of the country’s GDP in 2016. Although authorities, together with local animal protection groups and owners, are delivering food, primary veterinary care and even rehoming to animals left behind in this island; Barbuda remains uninhabitable, and permanent returns will not be possible until water and sanitation supplies are restored. Although the economy in the British Virgin Islands, relies mostly on tourism, there is a significant but undetermined number of pets and backyard animals, which were severely affected, due to the extensive damage -approximately 95% of all small coastal properties on the northern and western section on the island of Tortola destroyed or reported severe deterioration. Public services and transport activities in most of the territories were severely hampered, including secondary roads, which are critical to access arable land, remote locations and transport labour and agricultural products to markets and ports. In summary, as part of Irma and Maria impact, over USD $ 5 Billion is required to fulfill the recovery needs for Dominica, Barbuda, and the British Virgin Islands. Building back better\nMost of the injuries and deaths of animals during hurricanes are caused by flying debris, drowning or by being swept away by flash floods or strong winds. To avoid this impact on livestock is vital to leave the animals outside, so they will have more chances to survive, and after stress, they will need clean feed, a dry and safe place to stand, and clean water. Also, support with electrolytes and vitamins will help them in returning to normal. Younger animals are more susceptible to stress than older animals and may need more care. Having said that, as most damage to buildings, pens, and animals comes from wind and flying objects, the ability to protect them in advance from these dangers dramatically reduces the chance of injury to livestock.For this reason, it is essential to build or rebuild reinforced and wind-resistant structures, located away from floods’ path, implementing pre-hurricane evacuation plans and training animals for secure evacuation procedures. We, at World Animal Protection’s Animals in Disasters programme, understand and share the suffering of thousands of animals affected by hurricanes. In an attempt to deliver hope to their owners in distress, we offer preparedness information, case studies and catalyzing solutions through our website www.animalsindisasters.org, where resources like the online course PrepVet can be found, which provides general information on Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change, Emergency Management, and Animal Welfare.

Agriculture is a priority sector for the 20 member and associate Member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Their vision for the agricultural sector entails a complete transformation towards a market‐oriented, internationally competitive and environmentally sound system of agricultural production and services – one that provides improved food and nutrition security, especially for vulnerable groups. ICTs and their many applications can play a vital role in realising this ambitious vision. This vision has been set down in a number of policy documents, such as the Community Agriculture Policy, the Regional Food and Nutrition Security Policy and several supporting strategic policy frameworks, such as the Agribusiness Strategic Plan. One of the key imperatives of these policies is the adoption of modern knowledge and information systems to improve decision making and encourage interaction among all players in the value chain. These systems should also link R&D and extension efforts at the national, regional and international levels, and attempt to increase their impact on the entire agricultural sector in terms of adaptation of ICTs and other technology advances. Bridging information gaps\nA key challenge faced by farmers and agribusinesses is a lack of knowledge about markets, sources of technology and business support. ICTs could be used to fill these information gaps. For example, cellular networks and value-added services that can be accessed through these networks, have spread throughout the entire world. The speed of this diffusion and the variety of uses to which these networks have been put is indicative of the pent-up demand for more rapid and effective communication, even in the smallest and poorest communities. Market information gaps exist even within internal markets in the Caribbean region. The building of market information systems is therefore critical to ensuring that farmers and agribusiness persons are able to make the right decisions, plan ahead and link up with the necessary markets. Linking producers to regional and external markets means setting up robust market information and intelligence systems, which must be funded largely by the public sector. Crucial to this issue is the need for ICTs to gather, store and analyse, and subsequently disseminate information. Traditional extension services depend very much on there being a sufficient number of trained technicians to service a manageable number of farmers, and that those workers have the required budgets to do their work properly, even in remote villages. These extension services, if they ever existed, will probably become a thing of the past. There now is a critical need to build up digital databanks and translate technical information into user-friendly advice that can be accessed by farmers and agribusiness persons. The CARICOM region’s limited progress in the field is probably best illustrated by the sporadic presence of governments, regional institutions, NGOs and even established businesses on the web. These websites consist mostly of static web pages and are often short of relevant information and often lack the essential tools for communicating, doing business and engaging in national and regional dialogues. Innovative ICT initiatives\nNotwithstanding the many challenges, there are some encouraging innovative developments specific to ICTs in the Caribbean. For instance, at the policy level, the CARICOM member states recently approved a Regional Digital Development Strategy which is a modern strategy seeking to capitalise on existing national initiatives and amplify them for regional benefit. Additionally, funding has been acquired from the EU-funded Intra-ACP Agricultural Policy Programme to reinvigorate the development of a regional agricultural marketing information and intelligence system, and work has started to develop the necessary capacity for such a system, at both regional and national levels. National initiatives include Trinidad & Tobago’s National Agricultural Marketing and Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO), which has a mandate to improve marketing and investment in the country’s agro-industrial sector. NAMDEVCO has developed a National Agricultural Market Information System (NAMIS) which provides reliable and real-time information to farmers, processors, retailers and institutional buyers. Among the many innovations introduced by NAMIS is the use of hand-held devices for capturing data, which reduces the errors normally associated with data collection. Another national initiative is the government-operated Jamaica Agricultural Marketing Information System (JAMIS), which provides regular updates on over 50 agricultural products. JAMIS provides weekly updates on prices, availability and quality of agricultural produce on its website, where visitors can subscribe to a service that sends these reports to them by email.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:40d8d493-380c-4dac-ae67-904026b34ef0>"]},{"passage":"Various other innovative mobile applications are emerging in the academic world and through the work of private developers. These applications range from providing safety and weather information, to linking fishermen at sea with buyers for their catches. Others provide ‘real-time’ key information for specific fruit trees throughout the year. Meanwhile, the CARICOM Secretariat has created a Caribbean Agribusiness website with an ambitious agenda. This website is meant, eventually, to be a major internet portal integrating existing initiatives and relevant institutions, such as ministries of agriculture, producer organisations, agribusiness associations and inter-governmental organisations, to name a few, and serving as the hub for all matters in which business persons (at all scales of operation) have an interest – up-to-date information, statistics, trade and investment opportunities and policy issues. Caribbean Agribusiness is also meant to fill the information gap that currently exists in terms of all sorts of agricultural information but is not meant to replace or supersede any existing information service. The importance of embracing ICTs by the CARICOM’s agricultural sector cannot be overstated. Both public sector institutions and the private sector have to show leadership if the mandates to increase production and promote trade and food security are to be met. We have to explicitly recognise the role that ICTs play in the practical lives of producers and consumers alike and build on best practices within and outside of the region, and we must mainstream ICT-related activities into the various institutions’ ongoing programmes. Since every business, country and region depends on the flow of knowledge – from production processes through to marketing techniques and the sale and purchase of goods via the internet – investing, or the lack of it – in ICTs can have a ‘make or break’ effect on the ability of CARICOM to remain a viable, sought-after partner in the global agriculture arena.

I am Mr. Lester Johnson , the proud owner of the Everland farm located on Johnson Road right here on the island of Long Island. I firstly became involved in farming when my parents and grandparents would take me to our farm on most weekends to help out by doing various duties which included collecting the chicken eggs, milking the cows, and feeding all the animals. I eventually came to realize that farming was the perfect source to support myself and my family but over the years it has grown to more than just that. As a farmer I have been able to not only aid in the accommodation of the key necessities for the residents of the Bahamas but I have also subsidized to the deterioration of the five million dollar import deficit (reported by The Guardian in 2012). I have so for been a farmer for the past twelve years and in this business owned a commercial farm. Commercial farming is farming that provides products for sale and subsistence farming provides enough food for the farmer and his family but not enough for sale (both derived from Dictionary.com). In order to become a farmer the land in which you plan to grow on must first be acquired, the products that you plan on rearing whether it is livestock or crops, workers and machinery must also be in place. Farming has facilitated the job market of the Bahamas as it is able to hire individuals such as Naturalist, Food Chemist, Food Technician and Irrigation Engineer. As a mean to support farmers with the many expenses the government has provided them with some incentives these include the exemption from customs duty on specific items and the reduction of duty on specific items, the store credit program, small business loans and the exemptions of water use charges. An incentive is something that motivates or encourages someone to do something (stated by Oxford Dictionary). One of the premier initiatives provided by the government was the exemption and reduction on the Bahamas custom duty for specific items, this was an incentive put in place to let farmers pay little to no money on imported materials, machinery and requirements needed for quality crops and livestock. An exemption is the process of freeing or state of being free from an obligation or liability imposed on others (Dictionary.com). The exemption of customs duty would assist farmers in numerous ways, customs duty is a payment levied on the import, export, manufactured or sale goods (Oxford Dictionary). By being concluded from such a charge we farmers will not only be able to hire more adept experienced workers such as much needed agronomist but also use money not spent on the expenditure of their farms. We are given incentives on products such as hatching eggs and livestock and cattle which would exert or give other farmers the opportunity to venture into different crops. Farmers do not have to deal with various charges on farm equipment and machinery such as harvesters, materials used for the construction of green houses and feeding systems as the immunity lowers the cost on imported machinery. This has reinforced the government by causing them not to target so much on import and export bills because farmers like me would be able to have more of the crops that we used than to waste money on importing which will result in a lower cost on crops, allowing the money to continuously be pumped back into the economy. The exemption of customs duty on varied items for local farmers will not only assist in boosting the Bahamian economy but the farming industry as well. The government has then accommodated the initiative of stores on the credit program like farm and fish stores, farming input such as seed and fertilizer which concedes farmers to be paid prior to the crops being produced. They are given a credit of out of a certain lump sum of money for every acre of land that they own. The credit system is a system which allows workers to be paid before their work begins (Dictionary.com).The farmer would use this money to aid the outlying cultivation and development of his farm, as did I quiet some years ago. To be eligible for such a program a farmer must be a resident of the Bahamas and they must fill out an application at the Ministry of Agriculture. This initiative has assisted me as a farmer because the advances given to me can go towards the prosperity of my farm like crops, seeds, machinery and it also assists with the salary of my workers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:06ff0913-067e-405a-a0a3-72f9ce56f340>"]},{"passage":"- 1 How much does farming contribute to the economy? - 2 How did farming affect the economy? - 3 How big is the farming industry in the UK? - 4 How do farmers help the economy? - 5 What type of farmers make the most money? - 6 Why are farmers still poor? - 7 What negative effects does agriculture have on the environment? - 8 Are most farmers poor? - 9 Are UK farmers rich? - 10 How much do farmers make per acre UK? - 11 How much money do farmers make UK? - 12 Why are farmers important to society? - 13 Why is farming important to America? - 14 What are advantages of farming? How much does farming contribute to the economy? Agriculture, food, and related industries contributed $1.109 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, a 5.2-percent share. The output of America’s farms contributed $136.1 billion of this sum—about 0.6 percent of GDP. How did farming affect the economy? Agriculture and its related industries (things like food sales and other industries that wouldn’t exist or would be much smaller without agriculture ) contribute $1.05 trillion to U.S. GDP, according to the latest data. That puts agriculture’s contribution to the overall economy at about 6 percent. How big is the farming industry in the UK? The total area of agricultural holdings is about 23.07 million acres (9.34 million hectares), of which about a third are arable and most of the rest is grassland. During the growing season about half the arable area is cereal crops, and of the cereal crop area, more than 65% is wheat. How do farmers help the economy? America’s farmers and ranchers make an important contribution to the U.S. economy by ensuring a safe and reliable food supply, improving energy security and supporting job growth and economic development. What type of farmers make the most money? Though soybeans are the most profitable crop for large farms, fruit trees and berries generate the most profit of all farm sizes. As farm size increases, labor costs to tend and harvest fruit trees and berries become too high to maintain profits. Berries often produce multiple harvests in one growing season. Why are farmers still poor? In most places, however, land is scarce and incentives for good resource management are absent; soils are being depleted, holdings are shrinking and farmers are sliding deeper into poverty. What negative effects does agriculture have on the environment? Many critical environmental issues are tied to agriculture, such as climate change, dead zones, genetic engineering, pollutants, deforestation, soil degradation, waste, and many others. Deforestation is a big side effect of agriculture that greatly impacts our planet and the environment. Are most farmers poor? Agricultural poverty is not a new problem, it is a resurgent problem. The Farm Poverty Problem in America Today: According to the USDA, in 2018 the majority of farmers in America instead of earning money, had negative income. Median farm income for U.S. farm households was $-1,553. Are UK farmers rich? The market in the UK favours large farms over smaller units, and due to the capital costs involved, small farmers are often forced to use the larger farmers ‘ or contractors’ machinery to cultivate their land. Yes, they are rich or poor – like a lot of French farmers. How much do farmers make per acre UK? Overall, this meant average net farm income rose from £31 to £66 per acre while average farm profit margins grew by £27 per acre. Farm gross margin across the whole area farmed rose to £280 per acre. How much money do farmers make UK? Overall the average annual salary for people who work on farms is £25,578 – close to the national UK figure of £26,500. More than 30% earned between £20,000 and £30,000, but more than one in 10 (13%) reported they earned less than £10,000, which suggests they were either part-time or working as family labour. Why are farmers important to society? Farmers hold the backbone of the agricultural system. As it is common knowledge that for a country to progress the gross domestic product should be reasonable, agriculture is one of the important parts. The agricultural system will only run if there are crops being grown and harvested, so this where farmers come in.

This will increase the young farmer’s confidence in his harvest and earning. Case background: Because Mr. C does not have adequate knowledge and has issues with obtaining farmlands, the team suggests Mr. C to intern at the consultant’s farm in preparation for future business plans while learning relative skills and looking for appropriate farmlands. Consultant’s role: The consultant plays the role of a “coach” who assists and offers the young farmer an agricultural operation blueprint of his own by allowing an internship opportunity at the consultant’s farm. Visits and Cross-field Cooperation\nCase background: After joining the project advisory program, Mr. D and his consultant review both successful and failed cases of agricultural startup farmers and share his thoughts and opinions with other young farmers. Consultant’s role: The consultant serves as a “guide” who uses successful and failed cases to let young farmers understand the success and failure behind each story. The consultant also utilizes group discussion to lead young farmers into thinking whether there are any possible improvements to be made regarding their own operations. Sales Channel Expansion\nCase background: There are two cases to discuss. For Mr. E, he has stable agricultural production and aspires to learn sales. He first collaborates with the consultant’s existing sales channel, expands his sales channels, and then slowly develops his own business model and corresponding sales channels. For Mr. F, he has developed his own e-commerce platform and shares it with his consultant; they are partners in expanding sales channels. Consultant’s role: The consultant serves as both a “collaborator” and a “business partner.” To increase the young farmer’s confidence and stabilize the farmer’s basic income, the consultant promises to purchase all of the young farmer’s produce during the period of consultation. This process lets the young farmer establish and develop his own sales channel. Moreover, the consultant collaborates with young farmers in using e-commerce platforms to sell agricultural products while discussing methods on sales, becoming business partners in the process. Case background: Mr. G is unable to completely dictate his finance, human resource management, and mode of operation due to conflicts with senior owners within the family either due to owners’ non-acceptance of the young farmer’s operating methods or because senior owners have yet to relinquish control of the firm. Consultant’s role: The consultant plays the role of a “mediator” that establishes a positive image for the young farmer before the current owners. The consultant will convey the young farmer’s idea and merits to the senior owners within the family and convince the owners to allow the young farmer to partake in some areas of operations. The consultant will lead the young farmer in small projects, yield excellent produce, and help the young farmer earn the senior owners’ respect.

As the consuming public becomes more interested in techniques used in the production of the food and fiber they demand, the agriculturist must necessarily become more involved in public relations. As Charles Blatz so eloquently points out in his book, Ethics and Agriculture: An anthology on current issues in world context :\nAgriculture is changing around the world. The most dramatic of these changes threaten the very ability of humanity to produce the food needed to sustain itself. Yes, we are producing more on less land with less human effort, but some of our methods deteriorate the resources to such an extent that the production lives of many important agricultural areas can be numbered, not in centuries, but in decades ( Blatz, 1991, p. 1 ). As the world views agricultural issues in a new light, the consuming public has become more interested in production techniques ( Elliot & Olson, 1995 ). Consumers also have become actively involved in the management of public lands. Across the western United States, as well as the entire nation, recreation and tourism have become major sources of income to both individuals and state governments. Less than two percent of the population is involved in production agriculture ( American Farm Bureau, 1997 ). However, 100 percent of the population is involved in the consumption of agricultural products. Ethical issues pervade daily operations in all phases of the agricultural industry. Vice-President, Al Gore eludes to these concerns throughout his book Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit . \"Today, we enthusiastically participate in what is in essence a massive and unprecedented experiment with the natural systems of the global environment, with little regard for the moral consequence\" ( Gore, 1993 ). This quote follows a dissertation comparing the atrocities of Hitler and Stalin to the environmental destruction on the planet that society tolerates. Review of Relevant Literature\nOther professional and educational areas have identified numerous attempts to incorporate ethical issues into a variety of curricula. Bundy (1995) reported on an experiment by the University of California at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law to include a professional responsibility course in the first-year curriculum. Conclusions drawn from the study showed that due to the emphasis on the mastery of conventional legal analysis, student interest in professional responsibility may be ambivalent. There was no report on the continuation of the course. Stevens and Allen (1996) noted the ethical principles to be taught must be consistent with those in the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and its interpretations by the United States Supreme Court. Another profession with opportunities to deal with ethical issues surfaces in the field of medicine. A study, that utilized patient-led discussions in a genetics course to increase interaction of sensitive issues between patients and professionals, emphasized the unity of science, medicine and humanism through the problems and solutions offered by genetics ( Williamson, 1996 ). Few areas in agriculture have gone untouched by the debate over ethical issues. Ethical questions and issues have evolved in areas encompassing topics ranging from livestock show ring ethics to the use of animals in research laboratories. Other issues addressed range from control of natural resources and public lands to long-term effects of genetically altered food supplies. As these ethical questions have inundated agricultural professionals, the question for the agriculturist becomes one of responsibility. Agricultural education professionals need to become more and more proficient in the area of communication. In 1995 Jim Olsen and Jack Elliot completed a study that identified agricultural and environmental issues as seen by Arizona consumers. The implications of their study suggest that portraying an accurate message about agriculture is essential for the future of the country. Future generations of agriculturists will be faced with difficult ethical agricultural issues and will need to be prepared to deal with solving those problems. Dewey and Tuft's Ethics (1932) describes ethics as a science that deals with conduct. In their discussion on attempts at solving moral problems, Dewey writes about the scientific attempt to establish \"an order of judgments such that each one when made is of use in determining other judgments thereby securing control of their formation.\" (cited by Campbell, 1995). The art and science of problem solving has long been a focal point and instructional technique area for many agricultural education departments across the country.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1010a9fb-25d9-4067-9d1b-6d518c05de31>"]},{"passage":"Jamaica needs many more Barclay Ewarts to drive a manufacturing renaissance\nIN his tribute to Barclay Ewart, his friend, legendary entrepreneur Danny Williams, described the young Barclay Ewart as a modest person, who, despite his outstanding achievements in the field of sports, never let it go to his head. He was however \"determined to achieve his goals and worked assiduously at them, but was never unduly aggressive or vulgar in his efforts to do so\". Williams described him as \"true nationalist\", \"entrepreneur\" and most importantly \"a true industrialist\". If we look quickly at Ewart's background, he went abroad to Notre Dame University in the US to study chemical engineering on a track scholarship, switched to a degree in business administration, and when he came back to Jamaica took a job as a salesman with National Cash Register Company, selling office equipment and business machines. Such a background would seem the ideal preparation to become a serial industrial entrepreneur, involved in multiple businesses, which in Ewart's case included Tanners Jamaica, which he founded, Alkali Limited, Industrial Chemicals, Power & Tractors, and Leder Mode. More importantly, the ability to create new industries, or take old industries to another level, is the crucial element missing in job creation in Jamaica. The unfortunate fact is that it is not struggling entrepreneurs of necessity, creating limited value-added through buying and selling, that is going to drive job creation in Jamaica. It is only through entrepreneurs of opportunity, which an older generation might typically have called industrialists, such as Mr. Ewart, setting up new value-added industries in manufacturing, that will see the creation of the jobs Jamaica needs. Williams noted that he had lent Ewart what would have then been a significant sum of 5,000 pounds (he stressed he was repaid) to buy a stake in the company of which he was managing director, namely, Industrial Chemicals. The issue of the mobilisation of capital for industry remains a critical problem in Jamaica, an issue that I have tried to address in my online paper \"A new approach to development banking in Jamaica\". Such capital needs to be patient capital. As Williams notes, Ewart \"was not only interested in short-term gains. He was quite willing to invest his time and money in long term projects.\" Only a long-term approach can create new manufacturing industries, allowing Ewart (and so many others) to achieve his wish \"to help Jamaica become a better place for all Jamaicans to live in\". Williams noted that when he became minister of industry and commerce in the late 1970's, he asked Barclay to be the Chairman of the then Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC), which he accepted. It is worth noting that the JIDC's mandate, when it was created in the 1950's, included industrial development, provision of factory space, engineering services, food technology, industrial training and investment facilitation, amongst other things. Compared to today, at first glance, this appears much more of a one-stop shop for industry. Jdic, and some of its functions, were eventually subsumed into JAMPRO. According to Williams, when Ewart was a senator in 1989 to 1993, he made one of the most far reaching analysis of the industrial development required in Jamaica at a budget debate. His particular focus was the government's energy policy. As Williams puts it, \"He could not understand why the powers that be could not realise that the only sensible alternative was to turn to coal as our source of fuel to produce electricity. After all, wasn't America producing some 70% of its electricity from coal\", a debate which continues, despite Mr. Ewart having made his first report on this issue around 1980, as he observed at an Observer luncheon in 2009. Last Tuesday evening, immediately before Ewart's funeral, local broker Stocks and Securities limited had a forum appropriately entitled \"Manufacturing in Jamaica, Small and Medium Enterprises.\" The first presenter, Krishna Vaswani, described how, after moving back to Jamaica in 2004 (with a science background), rather than go into the family trading business, he made the difficult decision to go into manufacturing in Jamaica. In his case, he revived a piece of an old dormant factory, namely that of the formerly listed old West Indies Pulp and Paper business, to go into the manufacturing of toilet paper under the corporate name of Quality Incorporation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:354f9f46-d2e9-43c2-8459-35149327c6e1>"]}]}

Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

To which I’m asking but what creates that chemical unbalance in the first place? If meditation has been proven to alter the brain and body chemicals, could pain and depression alter those chemicals as well rather than this chemical unbalance creating depression? Therefore, what would happen if we started to treat the depression in the first place?

And I suspect it’s going to last. I don’t deny that in some cases there is actually a physical reason behind the issue, but I also believe it happens much less often than officially diagnosed – like clinical depression. If there are genuine cases of clinical depression, a large part of the given diagnostics are misinformed, and a lot of the time what those people really need instead of quick-fix drugs is the support of a therapist that offers unconditional love and positive regard. I’ve seen it in my practice many times and definitively intend to keep working in that direction. So if you’ve been diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder, before taking it for granted, please do some research and question the diagnostic. Nothing is ever set in stone…\n\nThe modern understanding of bipolar disorder is that it is primarily a biological illness with a genetic component. However, the exact causes of the condition - the things that set it in motion - are not definitively understood at this time.

So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders. What Counseling Strategies Work Well with Bipolar?\n\nSomeone that qualifies as being in a state of rapid-cycling experiences four or more episodes of mania or depression within a given year. This manifested form of BPD may come and go over time and can occur at any point throughout the disorder. Types Of Bipolar Disorder\nAlthough bipolar is known to present itself in many different ways, there are four main types of BPD that are each characterized by a unique set of symptoms: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, and Other or Unspecified Bipolar. Bipolar I is seen as the most classic form of the manic-depressive disorder, in that a person will experience at least one mixed or manic episode. The manic episodes typically last at least 7 days, and some symptoms can be so severe that the person may need to be hospitalized. Mixed episodes where both hypomanic and depressive symptoms are present is a common feature of bipolar I. Although not in all cases, bipolar I usually involves at least one depressive episode, lasting about 2 weeks. Bipolar II is characterized by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but full-blown manic episodes are not experienced. Cyclothymia is defined by cyclical mood swings that occur on a fairly regular basis. The symptoms of hypomania and depression in this type of BPD are typically less severe in form but can still have a serious negative impact on a person’s life. Cyclothymia can also progress into full-fledged manic or depressive episodes. Causes And Triggers Of Bipolar Disorder\nThere is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the cause of bipolar disorder, but scientific research suggests that the onset of these mood disorders likely results from a multitude of factors and the interactions that occur between them. Bipolar disorder is known to run in families, but genes are not the only thing at play here. While some inherit a genetic vulnerability to the disorder, many with the same genetic predisposition never develop the illness. This alone shows that there are other factors aside from genes that are responsible. Environmental factors, such as stress or loss can act as triggers creating new episodes or exacerbating existing symptoms. Sleep deprivation and substance abuse are also known to trigger and exacerbate symptoms of BPD. The variations in severity coupled with the interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, and psychosocial elements are what cause these disorders to be so complex, and therefore difficult to treat, especially when substance abuse and bipolar disorder are combined. Subjective reports indicate that marijuana use is intended mostly to relieve the positive symptoms of the schizophrenic condition. People with this mental illness may use cannabis to relieve the psychological strain caused by delusion or hallucination; or “chill them out” and relieve the effects of physical or verbal agitation. The Brain And Bipolar Disorder\nGiven its vast complexity, our understanding for the brain’s interworking mechanisms remains quite limited. New theories about communicative neural processes arise as science continues to progress—keeping the field of abnormal psychology and the way we treat mental health disorders always changing. In cases of bipolar disorder, it’s pretty clear that emotion seems to overtake behavior, but new research has given us a glimpse into the processes and mechanisms by which this happens: the brain’s emotional centers are exhibiting too much activity, whereas the judgment and impulse control centers (located in the frontal lobes) exhibit too little. This has led experts to believe that much of bipolar disorder’s underlying cause resides in the circuitry of the brain that contributes to our overall functionality. Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters serve as the messengers within these circuits; they travel through our brain’s neural pathways to allow different parts (or “hubs”) to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitter imbalances disrupt and alter the communicative routs between brain cells, causing impairment to processes such as mood regulation upon which we rely and ultimately the attributes that make us who we are. The three key neurotransmitters responsible for brain and bodily function, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine, are believed to play an important role in the onset of BPD.\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.\n\nBipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.\n\nBipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.\n\n2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac. In this state, a person may feel extreme highs and engage in risky .\n\nWe all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.","passages":[{"passage":"Of course you can argue that bipolar disorder is actually caused by a chemical unbalance in the brain.

So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders.

This manifested form of BPD may come and go over time and can occur at any point throughout the disorder. Types Of Bipolar Disorder\nAlthough bipolar is known to present itself in many different ways, there are four main types of BPD that are each characterized by a unique set of symptoms: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, and Other or Unspecified Bipolar. Bipolar I is seen as the most classic form of the manic-depressive disorder, in that a person will experience at least one mixed or manic episode. The manic episodes typically last at least 7 days, and some symptoms can be so severe that the person may need to be hospitalized. Mixed episodes where both hypomanic and depressive symptoms are present is a common feature of bipolar I. Although not in all cases, bipolar I usually involves at least one depressive episode, lasting about 2 weeks. Bipolar II is characterized by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but full-blown manic episodes are not experienced. Cyclothymia is defined by cyclical mood swings that occur on a fairly regular basis. The symptoms of hypomania and depression in this type of BPD are typically less severe in form but can still have a serious negative impact on a person’s life. Cyclothymia can also progress into full-fledged manic or depressive episodes. Causes And Triggers Of Bipolar Disorder\nThere is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the cause of bipolar disorder, but scientific research suggests that the onset of these mood disorders likely results from a multitude of factors and the interactions that occur between them. Bipolar disorder is known to run in families, but genes are not the only thing at play here. While some inherit a genetic vulnerability to the disorder, many with the same genetic predisposition never develop the illness. This alone shows that there are other factors aside from genes that are responsible. Environmental factors, such as stress or loss can act as triggers creating new episodes or exacerbating existing symptoms. Sleep deprivation and substance abuse are also known to trigger and exacerbate symptoms of BPD. The variations in severity coupled with the interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, and psychosocial elements are what cause these disorders to be so complex, and therefore difficult to treat, especially when substance abuse and bipolar disorder are combined. Subjective reports indicate that marijuana use is intended mostly to relieve the positive symptoms of the schizophrenic condition. People with this mental illness may use cannabis to relieve the psychological strain caused by delusion or hallucination; or “chill them out” and relieve the effects of physical or verbal agitation. The Brain And Bipolar Disorder\nGiven its vast complexity, our understanding for the brain’s interworking mechanisms remains quite limited. New theories about communicative neural processes arise as science continues to progress—keeping the field of abnormal psychology and the way we treat mental health disorders always changing. In cases of bipolar disorder, it’s pretty clear that emotion seems to overtake behavior, but new research has given us a glimpse into the processes and mechanisms by which this happens: the brain’s emotional centers are exhibiting too much activity, whereas the judgment and impulse control centers (located in the frontal lobes) exhibit too little. This has led experts to believe that much of bipolar disorder’s underlying cause resides in the circuitry of the brain that contributes to our overall functionality. Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters serve as the messengers within these circuits; they travel through our brain’s neural pathways to allow different parts (or “hubs”) to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitter imbalances disrupt and alter the communicative routs between brain cells, causing impairment to processes such as mood regulation upon which we rely and ultimately the attributes that make us who we are. The three key neurotransmitters responsible for brain and bodily function, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine, are believed to play an important role in the onset of BPD.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1d2d8a66-50a6-4fd5-8dde-c4d65c7a4573>"]},{"passage":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5ae6729d-06bc-4f01-bc7b-0b81db567919>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:20e044c2-af29-4922-89b1-b0ccc357332a>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:83a19198-4d7a-4dd9-b850-5ad97b6a05ea>"]},{"passage":"2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac.

Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f689f908-3741-4a60-b398-829a1a7f9ff9>"]}]}

Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor—China Railway Seventh Group—under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn’t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. “The contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,” said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district.\n\nKampala – Entebbe Expressway\nOpened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala – Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda’s international Airport. This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.\n\nIn this series we are doing a deep dive into the sourcing process today, and, in particular discussing what is involved, what is typically done (manually), and whether or not it should be that way. We have already completed our initial discussion of the initial project request review phase, the follow up needs assessment, the strategy selection phase, the communication phase, the analysis phase, and the negotiations phase. Now we are in the final contracting phase. At first glance, it looks like this is the second most strategic and human-driven phase there is, second only to negotiation, as it is humans (and lawyers in particular) who typically define standard terms and conditions, humans who identify risk and mitigation strategies, humans who define obligations, and humans who analyze the contract for compliance to goals. But is this the case? So in this final step, the contract step, we have these final sub-steps:\n- Standard Terms and Conditions\n- Modification & Risk Mitigation to Supplier & Country\n- Key Metadata definition and obligation specification\n- Contract Analytics\nIf all of the standard terms and conditions are in existing contracts and the contract clause \/ template repository, there’s no reason that a system cannot automatically scan the contracts and repositories, identify the standard organizational terms in every contract, identify the standard terms for the category, and identify any terms, often not included, that would be relevant to the category. Probabilities can be applied and contract terms organized by weight. The buyer can then just bulk select or bulk reject the relevant clauses. In the modification and risk mitigation step, a contract analytics engine can be applied to determine how well a particular clause addresses a certain risk of relevance to the organization based on context models and differentials. It can then compare that clause to the clauses that best address the risk and identify the necessary modifications, and do so specifically from a supplier or geographic context. In the key metadata definition and obligation specification step, the goal is to identify the right metadata that needs to be tracked against the contract. This will be dependent on the terms and conditions, the goals, the obligations, and other key information that will be specific to the contract. However, contract analytics can identify, or at least suggest, much of this as well automatically based upon similar contracts, similar terms, similar goals, and similar obligations. This can greatly reduce the effort required by a buyer. In the final step, the contract analytics step, the identification of risks, variances from a norm, and non-standard clauses can often be better identified by a contracts analytics engine that can cross-compare potentially risky clauses and variant clauses across hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts and identify deviations from the norm. A user just has to decide whether the variance is enough to be of interest to them, and properly setting a threshold can eliminate the majority of those variances that are not. In other words, at the end of the day, contract analytics identifies the majority of standard terms and conditions that are of interest, the majority of standard clauses that will need modifications to address supplier and country risk, the relevant metadata and obligations associated with the contract, and any clauses that can be considered variant enough to warrant special consideration. The majority of the work can be automated with a good contract analytics engine — the role of the buyer is to apply their intelligence to determine how accurate and effective it is. As the buyer trains the engine, it will become more and more accurate over time and the strategic work will be reduced to hours, sometimes minutes for simple contracts, compared to days or weeks. In other words, the more we explore the sourcing process, the more we find out how truly tactical, or at least automatable, the majority of it is.\n\nThis agreement (in conjunction with the trade agreement) contains all understanding and agreement between the parties as to the purpose of this agreement and replaces all agreements, documents, projections, financial data, statements and advance guarantees, orally orally, explicit or implied, between the parties concerned and their related companies, representatives and agents concerned with respect to the purpose of this agreement. the offer or terms and conditions that brought the parties together. This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.\n\nBelfast City Council is the Data Controller under the UK General Data Protection Regulation UK GDPR for the personal data it gathers for the purposes of sending email updates from Commercial and Procurement Services.

For instance, if you have a contract to buy a house but amid the transaction, a hurricane comes by and destroys it, what would it entail? Would the buyer still need to purchase it with the same amount or would it be less? You would also need to indicate what each party should and should not do. 4. Make sure to elaborate on the terms and conditions in the contract. Be specific and layout all the exact terms to avoid confusion, especially if this agreement affects a whole organization or future leaders. If there are damages or liabilities which the opposite party accepts, this too should be included in the terms. 5. Of course, all contracts can also end as agreed by both parties so it is also advisable to add a termination clause. This clause states all the legal ways of removing one party or both parties from such agreement without breach. This is most essential for long term contacts. 6. Never forget to sign and notarize. Make a contract legal by obtaining the signature of both parties which also means naming it after those involved. Having it notarized is also essential as it will make the contract a public instrument and can be used in court. It means nothing if the offer is accepted but has no written proof. If there should be changes, negotiation should be done and altered in the contract. 7. Lastly, make sure that all things agreed are legal and binding. Consider the age of the people involved, the nature of the industry and if the agreement was made in good faith. Any fraudulent transactions or threats can void the contract. Format of a contract\nThere’s no definite format for contracts since its content can go long or short, depending on the agreement. The essential elements that need to be found on a contract though can be summed up in this sample which elaborates on the parts of a client-vendor contract. This is a short description of the two parties who are in agreement, the sum of the project, duration of the project or date, and the monetary value or cost of the agreement. Provide information about the agreement that includes the job, duties, responsibilities, and promises of the vendor and the client. If there are payment terms involved, this will be considered a responsibility for the client. 3. Scope of work\nThis part elaborates on the deliverables of the vendor. If there is a budget involved, explain in detail what they get in return. Explain the inclusions, freebies (if any), limitations and any process that should be observed. Indicate how a situation be managed when things don’t go as planned. May it be changes, challenges, “acts of God” such as interventions from nature, or anything affecting the agreement to change. Place the additional fees or workload that should be included if there are any. 5. Rights of clients and vendors\nIf this was a product such as music, graphic design or photos, copyright ownerships can be elaborated in the contract. You can indicate the limitations of where it can or cannot be used, you can also explain if the work is completely turned over to the client or if a non-editable work is only given. If you don’t want this work to be used in billboards, you can also limit the ownership to digital use. As long as it was agreed, it can be placed on the contract. This is often optional for small online businesses or freelancers but for big companies, this is a must. Explain the duration of which your company is willing to fix\/return or exchange the product or service. It is recommended though that the date be specific rather than placing a number of days in the contract to avoid loopholes. Of course, if the warranty is over, the question still is what happens next? What should the client pay for your company to fix things after the expiration of the warranty? 7. Fees and payment method\nWill the payment be paid in full once the work is done? Is there a 50% down payment required before the project is started? Will there be a monthly fee or additional fee when plans change? How would the timeline look like? These are the common questions that you should ask yourself when drafting this section. If you can, it is best to assign an amount for every milestone reached, especially if the payment terms are in staggered payment terms. Not all partnerships and client-vendor relationships work. If there is a need to cancel the contract, this section should indicate what are valid premises, the conditions and what should be done to cancel the whole agreement. 9. Acceptance by signature\nMake sure to get it signed and sealed!\n\n• 3rd Contract Large-scale Prime Construction (Prime). USAID\/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID\/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID\/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID\/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment. Figure 1: Map of the Aceh Road Project\nContracts Start Date Finish Date Road Length Bridges Culverts Priority Oct 2006 Dec 2007 40 km 14 65 Prime Jun 2007 Feb 2010 104 km 17 128 Total 144 km 31 193 In November 2005, the OIG conducted an audit of USAID\/Indonesia’s Banda Aceh-Lamno road reconstruction activities implemented by WiKa for the priority road segments. 2 The OIG concluded that it could not determine whether all of the road reconstruction activities were on schedule to be completed by the overall project completion date and within the overall estimated costs because the Mission did not have an approved road design or an approved implementation plan in place. 2 OIG, Audit of USAID\/Indonesia’s Banda AcehLamno Road Reconstruction Activities Under Its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program , Report No. 5-497-06-003-P (Manila, Philippines: March 30, 2006)\nIn October 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review of USAID\/Indonesia’s road reconstruction project as part of its Congressionally mandated monitoring of U.S. reconstruction assistance to tsunami-affected countries. In its report, GAO concluded that USAID\/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID\/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID\/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities. OIG photograph of road construction near the Raba River bridge crossing at Km 25 in Aceh Province, Indonesia. (March 2007) AUDIT OBJECTIVE The Regional Inspector General\/Manila conducted this audit as part of its fiscal year 2007 annual audit plan to answer the following question: Is USAID\/Indonesia managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its • Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost? Appendix I contains a discussion of the audit’s scope and methodology. 3 GAO, Foreign Assistance USAID Signature Tsunami Reconstruction Efforts in Indonesia and Sri Lanka Exceed Initial Cost and Schedule Estimates, and Face Further Risks , GAO-07-357 (Washington, D.C.: February 28, 2007)\nAUDIT FINDINGS USAID\/Indonesia was managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost. While USAID\/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk. Nevertheless, these risk factorssome of which were beyond the Mission’s controlimpacted on the Aceh road project and caused delays.\n\nCONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATION If the Tenderer is a consortium, the consortium as a whole should meet the required minimum capacities (add rows as required). 3.1 Economic and financial standing (Contract Notice III.2.2) Requirements and possible minimum levels to the economic and financial standing of the Tenderer are specified in the Contract Notice, and are requested in accordance with Article 47 of the Directive. a) Annual turnover of the Tenderer (add rows as required) DKK mill.

There are 10 parts to this training. In the previous article, we went over some common issues and general ideas about MATOC\/IDIQ contracts. From here on, we will explain each part of the proposal in detail. This article is about the Technical section of the proposal. Many RFPs require a technical section. Do not confuse this with the Technical Proposal vs Price Proposal that is usually required. The technical section is where you explain your solution with technical details and show its merit. Be it an IT project or a service\/maintenance or construction or training, all such projects usually require you to provide your solution in detail. I will take one step further and say: even if the RFP requirements don’t ask for it, go ahead and give the reviewer the information. He will understand that you know your business. This will make him more confident about your capabilities. Understanding the Requirements:\nI cannot emphasize more how important it is to fully understand the RFP requirements as a whole. When it comes to the technical part, it is so importance that can mean having a losing or a winning solution\/proposal. You need to read and reread, do research, get to your inside contacts if you have, ask questions from the contracting officer and use all other means to make sure that you have covered all areas of concern and are fully in sync with the mentality of the client. You need to ask yourself why are they putting out this RFP, what are their concerns, what have been the issues in previous executions of this contract – if it is a repeat – what are the client’s metrics, …\nTo do that, put yourself in the shoes of the government selection committee. First you need to understand what you want and what you are concerned about. Then you need to know what metric to use to select from the different solutions offered to you and how to assess them. Go through this mental practice. It will help you shape your proposal, it will help you put key explanations where they are needed to clear questions from the mind of the reader, and it will help you be in sync with the reader. Compliance with the Technical Requirements:\nThe proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work, including operations and maintenance problems presented therein, if any. Your proposal should provide evidence of sufficient planning to show that work will be accomplished as required and on schedule, utilizing all available resources. You need to demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements and goals set forth in the scope of work, and address each separately. The best way to do this is to prepare a compliance matrix (chart), identifying client’s needs side by side with your solutions. Sometimes the RFP requires that matrix, but even if it doesn’t, you should include it. It will save a lot of work from the reviewer and he will be thankful of you because you have decreased his workload. Obviously each proposal has its own unique solution but a set of general guidelines can be derived:\n- Be Complete, Accurate and Persuasive\n- Identify the outcomes they’re looking to achieve\n- Recommend a solution that solves\/satisfies client’s needs, issues, and\/or concerns\n- Include the facilities, equipment, software, special expertise, methods used, and technologies on which your solution is based on\n- Identify the challenges and give solutions for the challenges\n- Present evidence that your team can deliver your solution on time and on budget (case studies)\n- Avoid marketing fluff, technical jargon, and outrageous claims. At the sametime, don’t just describe features of your solution; describe the benefits too. Forget about those who tell you that proposals should use minimum graphics. Pictures, drawings, charts, infographic and art work capture attention, and reduce the dullness of the pages of writing. Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewers. They read proposals often under less-than-ideal conditions, when they are very busy, in late hours, under pressure… like all of us. So you need to give them some spirit and cheer them up through your proposal; don’t make them more tired and bored. At the same time, don’t overdo yourself. Use maximum one graphic piece for each subject. Don’t be abstract, make it to the point.","passages":[{"passage":"Construction of Entebbe-Kibuye road in Uganda 50% complete\nThe 22 kilometres road section between Entebbe and Kibuye is being rehabilitated by Chinese contractor, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com\/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor—China Railway Seventh Group—under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn’t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. “The contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,” said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e72a2831-82ab-4e50-9736-bb94c91209cb>"]},{"passage":"Kampala – Entebbe Expressway\nOpened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala – Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda’s international Airport. This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3b66253e-2ea9-4432-b47a-e0fa41fb3aca>"]},{"passage":"In this series we are doing a deep dive into the sourcing process today, and, in particular discussing what is involved, what is typically done (manually), and whether or not it should be that way. We have already completed our initial discussion of the initial project request review phase, the follow up needs assessment, the strategy selection phase, the communication phase, the analysis phase, and the negotiations phase. Now we are in the final contracting phase. At first glance, it looks like this is the second most strategic and human-driven phase there is, second only to negotiation, as it is humans (and lawyers in particular) who typically define standard terms and conditions, humans who identify risk and mitigation strategies, humans who define obligations, and humans who analyze the contract for compliance to goals. But is this the case? So in this final step, the contract step, we have these final sub-steps:\n- Standard Terms and Conditions\n- Modification & Risk Mitigation to Supplier & Country\n- Key Metadata definition and obligation specification\n- Contract Analytics\nIf all of the standard terms and conditions are in existing contracts and the contract clause \/ template repository, there’s no reason that a system cannot automatically scan the contracts and repositories, identify the standard organizational terms in every contract, identify the standard terms for the category, and identify any terms, often not included, that would be relevant to the category. Probabilities can be applied and contract terms organized by weight. The buyer can then just bulk select or bulk reject the relevant clauses. In the modification and risk mitigation step, a contract analytics engine can be applied to determine how well a particular clause addresses a certain risk of relevance to the organization based on context models and differentials. It can then compare that clause to the clauses that best address the risk and identify the necessary modifications, and do so specifically from a supplier or geographic context. In the key metadata definition and obligation specification step, the goal is to identify the right metadata that needs to be tracked against the contract. This will be dependent on the terms and conditions, the goals, the obligations, and other key information that will be specific to the contract. However, contract analytics can identify, or at least suggest, much of this as well automatically based upon similar contracts, similar terms, similar goals, and similar obligations. This can greatly reduce the effort required by a buyer. In the final step, the contract analytics step, the identification of risks, variances from a norm, and non-standard clauses can often be better identified by a contracts analytics engine that can cross-compare potentially risky clauses and variant clauses across hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts and identify deviations from the norm. A user just has to decide whether the variance is enough to be of interest to them, and properly setting a threshold can eliminate the majority of those variances that are not. In other words, at the end of the day, contract analytics identifies the majority of standard terms and conditions that are of interest, the majority of standard clauses that will need modifications to address supplier and country risk, the relevant metadata and obligations associated with the contract, and any clauses that can be considered variant enough to warrant special consideration. The majority of the work can be automated with a good contract analytics engine — the role of the buyer is to apply their intelligence to determine how accurate and effective it is. As the buyer trains the engine, it will become more and more accurate over time and the strategic work will be reduced to hours, sometimes minutes for simple contracts, compared to days or weeks. In other words, the more we explore the sourcing process, the more we find out how truly tactical, or at least automatable, the majority of it is.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8899ebdb-4b4f-4846-b11d-77935a9c0381>"]},{"passage":"This agreement (in conjunction with the trade agreement) contains all understanding and agreement between the parties as to the purpose of this agreement and replaces all agreements, documents, projections, financial data, statements and advance guarantees, orally orally, explicit or implied, between the parties concerned and their related companies, representatives and agents concerned with respect to the purpose of this agreement. the offer or terms and conditions that brought the parties together. This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:79a7e0c1-cff7-4f07-a94d-3b146e12d13d>"]},{"passage":"Belfast City Council is the Data Controller under the UK General Data Protection Regulation UK GDPR for the personal data it gathers for the purposes of sending email updates from Commercial and Procurement Services.

Would the buyer still need to purchase it with the same amount or would it be less? You would also need to indicate what each party should and should not do. 4. Make sure to elaborate on the terms and conditions in the contract. Be specific and layout all the exact terms to avoid confusion, especially if this agreement affects a whole organization or future leaders. If there are damages or liabilities which the opposite party accepts, this too should be included in the terms. 5. Of course, all contracts can also end as agreed by both parties so it is also advisable to add a termination clause. This clause states all the legal ways of removing one party or both parties from such agreement without breach. This is most essential for long term contacts. 6. Never forget to sign and notarize. Make a contract legal by obtaining the signature of both parties which also means naming it after those involved. Having it notarized is also essential as it will make the contract a public instrument and can be used in court. It means nothing if the offer is accepted but has no written proof. If there should be changes, negotiation should be done and altered in the contract. 7. Lastly, make sure that all things agreed are legal and binding.

Provide information about the agreement that includes the job, duties, responsibilities, and promises of the vendor and the client. If there are payment terms involved, this will be considered a responsibility for the client. 3. Scope of work\nThis part elaborates on the deliverables of the vendor. If there is a budget involved, explain in detail what they get in return. Explain the inclusions, freebies (if any), limitations and any process that should be observed. Indicate how a situation be managed when things don’t go as planned. May it be changes, challenges, “acts of God” such as interventions from nature, or anything affecting the agreement to change.

You can indicate the limitations of where it can or cannot be used, you can also explain if the work is completely turned over to the client or if a non-editable work is only given. If you don’t want this work to be used in billboards, you can also limit the ownership to digital use. As long as it was agreed, it can be placed on the contract. This is often optional for small online businesses or freelancers but for big companies, this is a must. Explain the duration of which your company is willing to fix\/return or exchange the product or service. It is recommended though that the date be specific rather than placing a number of days in the contract to avoid loopholes. Of course, if the warranty is over, the question still is what happens next? What should the client pay for your company to fix things after the expiration of the warranty? 7.

USAID\/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID\/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID\/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID\/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment.

In its report, GAO concluded that USAID\/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID\/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID\/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities.

There are 10 parts to this training. In the previous article, we went over some common issues and general ideas about MATOC\/IDIQ contracts. From here on, we will explain each part of the proposal in detail. This article is about the Technical section of the proposal. Many RFPs require a technical section. Do not confuse this with the Technical Proposal vs Price Proposal that is usually required. The technical section is where you explain your solution with technical details and show its merit. Be it an IT project or a service\/maintenance or construction or training, all such projects usually require you to provide your solution in detail. I will take one step further and say: even if the RFP requirements don’t ask for it, go ahead and give the reviewer the information. He will understand that you know your business. This will make him more confident about your capabilities. Understanding the Requirements:\nI cannot emphasize more how important it is to fully understand the RFP requirements as a whole. When it comes to the technical part, it is so importance that can mean having a losing or a winning solution\/proposal. You need to read and reread, do research, get to your inside contacts if you have, ask questions from the contracting officer and use all other means to make sure that you have covered all areas of concern and are fully in sync with the mentality of the client. You need to ask yourself why are they putting out this RFP, what are their concerns, what have been the issues in previous executions of this contract – if it is a repeat – what are the client’s metrics, …\nTo do that, put yourself in the shoes of the government selection committee. First you need to understand what you want and what you are concerned about. Then you need to know what metric to use to select from the different solutions offered to you and how to assess them. Go through this mental practice. It will help you shape your proposal, it will help you put key explanations where they are needed to clear questions from the mind of the reader, and it will help you be in sync with the reader. Compliance with the Technical Requirements:\nThe proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work, including operations and maintenance problems presented therein, if any. Your proposal should provide evidence of sufficient planning to show that work will be accomplished as required and on schedule, utilizing all available resources. You need to demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements and goals set forth in the scope of work, and address each separately. The best way to do this is to prepare a compliance matrix (chart), identifying client’s needs side by side with your solutions. Sometimes the RFP requires that matrix, but even if it doesn’t, you should include it. It will save a lot of work from the reviewer and he will be thankful of you because you have decreased his workload. Obviously each proposal has its own unique solution but a set of general guidelines can be derived:\n- Be Complete, Accurate and Persuasive\n- Identify the outcomes they’re looking to achieve\n- Recommend a solution that solves\/satisfies client’s needs, issues, and\/or concerns\n- Include the facilities, equipment, software, special expertise, methods used, and technologies on which your solution is based on\n- Identify the challenges and give solutions for the challenges\n- Present evidence that your team can deliver your solution on time and on budget (case studies)\n- Avoid marketing fluff, technical jargon, and outrageous claims. At the sametime, don’t just describe features of your solution; describe the benefits too. Forget about those who tell you that proposals should use minimum graphics. Pictures, drawings, charts, infographic and art work capture attention, and reduce the dullness of the pages of writing. Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewers. They read proposals often under less-than-ideal conditions, when they are very busy, in late hours, under pressure… like all of us. So you need to give them some spirit and cheer them up through your proposal; don’t make them more tired and bored. At the same time, don’t overdo yourself. Use maximum one graphic piece for each subject. Don’t be abstract, make it to the point.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f0d2b143-4e28-4476-bca4-4ae10c04bc70>"]}]}

A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?","gold":"Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. Additionally, there's a double taxation situation where the corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, and then shareholders must pay taxes on that income themselves. However, corporate profits are taxed at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay.","answer":"Corporations, compared to other business structures like sole proprietorships and S-corporations, have several key tax implications:\n\n1. **Separate Tax Entity**: Corporations are separate tax entities from their owners. This means that the corporation itself pays income taxes on its profits. Shareholders do not pay taxes on corporate profits until they receive dividends, which are then taxed as personal income.\n\n2. **Corporate Tax Rates**: The corporate tax rates can be different from individual tax rates. Currently, in the United States, the corporate tax rate is a flat 21% on taxable income (as of 2023), which is lower than the top marginal rate for individuals. However, this does not mean that corporations pay less overall; the dual taxation (once at the corporate level and again at the individual level when dividends are paid) can lead to higher total tax liabilities for shareholders.\n\n3. **Double Taxation**: One of the main tax implications of a corporation is the potential for double taxation. This occurs when a corporation earns a profit, pays taxes on that profit, and then distributes those profits to shareholders as dividends, which are taxed again at the individual level. This can result in a higher effective tax rate for shareholders compared to other business structures.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Distributions**: Corporations have more flexibility in how they distribute profits to shareholders. They can choose to retain earnings for reinvestment in the business, pay dividends, or even distribute non-cash assets.\n\n5. **Retirement Plans and Fringe Benefits**: Corporations can offer a wide range of retirement plans and fringe benefits to employees, which can be a significant advantage for attracting and retaining talent. These benefits can also provide tax advantages to both the corporation and the employees.\n\n6. **Net Operating Losses (NOLs)**: Corporations can carry forward net operating losses for up to 20 years, which can be used to offset future taxable income, providing a form of tax planning and risk management.\n\n7. **Basis Adjustments**: Contributions of capital or other property to the corporation by shareholders can give basis to the shareholders, which can be important for tax purposes when selling their shares or receiving distributions from the corporation.\n\n8. **Tax Year Election**: Corporations have the option to choose a tax year that differs from the calendar year, which can be strategically advantageous for tax planning purposes.\n\n9. **Charitable Contributions**: Corporations can make charitable contributions up to 10% of their taxable income, which can provide a significant tax benefit.\n\n10. **International Operations**: Corporations have more flexibility in managing international operations and can take advantage of various international tax strategies, such as foreign tax credits and controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules.\n\n11. **Estate Planning**: Incorporation can also play a role in estate planning, as the corporation itself is a separate legal entity that can continue to operate after the death of its founders.\n\nOverall, the tax implications of a corporation are complex and depend on various factors, including the size of the corporation, the nature of its business, and the specific circumstances of its shareholders. It's important for business owners to carefully consider these tax implications when choosing a business structure.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: As a small business owner, it's important to understand the tax implications of your business decisions. Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities. If you do business in multiple countries, you may be subject to international tax laws and regulations. A business attorney or a tax expert can advise you on your international tax obligations.

Whenever you start a business, you will have to select one organizational type from out of all the different business structures. This choice determines how your business will be set up and organized. In most instances, you will probably have to choose between a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, a corporation, or a sole proprietorship. There are some criteria that you can use to find the business structure that works the best for your purpose. These criteria are:\nThe general rule for this category is that the more dangerous or risky the activity that your business will engage in, the less personal liability you want to have. Both corporations and LLCs allow business owners a type of \"limited liability,\" where anyone seeking claims against the business will have a very hard time placing personal liability on you as the owner. Conversely, if you were to organize your business as a partnership or a sole proprietorship, you could be personally responsible for anything the business did wrong. Expenses and Procedures\nIn general, there is no special paperwork that needs to be filed in order to establish either of these business structures. In addition, there are rarely any fees associated with establishing or maintaining either of these business structures. LLCs and corporations, on the other hand, are almost always more difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. In order to establish a corporation or limited liability company, you must file \"Articles of Incorporation\" with your secretary of state and pay fees associated with the incorporation. The details of the articles of incorporation and the amount of the fee will vary depending upon the state where you set up your business. In addition, when deciding to form a corporation or LLC, the owners of the business must decide which officers to elect to run the company. LLCs and corporations must keep specific and detailed records of any important business decisions, and follow many other formalities that are associated with these business structures. The easiest way to think about the different income tax structures that these business structures will use is to break them into two categories -- one comprised of those business structures where the business owners pay taxes on business profits, and one that includes all business structures where the business owners do not pay taxes on business profits. The first category includes sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs. These business structures are often referred to as \"pass-through\" tax entities because the taxes on the business profits and losses pass through to the business owners on their personal income taxes. Business owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs must report and pay taxes on all net profits from their business, even if they take no money out of the business' account during the tax year. Unlike the pass through tax businesses, the owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on the net business profits of the corporation. Instead, the business owners of a corporation pay taxes only on the profits they actually take from the corporation in the form of salaries, dividends and bonuses. Because a corporation is a separate tax entity, it must pay taxes on any profits that remain within the company during a tax year, and also on any profits that it pays out in the form of dividends to shareholders. There is a tax benefit to forming your business as a corporation. The owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on any profits that the corporation keeps, and the corporation pays taxes at a lower rate than do some individuals. Structuring a business as a corporation allows a business to sell shares of ownership in the business through stock offerings. This is different than the other three business structures, which do not allow the selling of part of the business through the sale of stocks. Because of this investment scheme, it may allow owners of a corporation to attract investors and retain employees more easily by offering stock. If you never plan on having your business go on sale to the public, however, and don't need the investment incentives to retain employees, you probably do not need to go through the added procedure and cost of forming a corporation. If you desire the limited personal liability that comes from a corporation, you could instead form your business as a LLC. An LLC provides many of the advantages of a corporation while remaining more flexible. Let an Attorney Help You Form Your New Business\nWhether you're just starting your new business, would like to transition your business to a different legal structure, or have other questions regarding your business, you may benefit tremendously from legal assistance.\n\nWhich Business Structure Is Right for You? In their book, Start Your Own Business, the staff of Entrepreneur Media Inc. guides you through the critical steps to starting a business, then supports you in surviving the first three years as a business owner. In this edited excerpt, the authors briefly review the different legal business structures you may want to choose for your small business. Of all the decisions you make when starting a business, one of the most important ones is the type of legal structure you select for your company. Not only will this decision have an impact on how much you pay in taxes, but it will affect the amount of paperwork your business is required to do, the personal liability you face and your ability to raise money. The simplest structure is the sole proprietorship, which usually involves just one individual who owns and operates the enterprise. With a sole proprietorship, your business earnings are taxed only once, unlike other business structures. Another big plus is that you will have complete control over your business—you make all the decisions. The tax aspects of a sole proprietorship are appealing because the expenses and your income from the business are included on your personal income tax return, Form 1040. Your profits and losses are recorded on a form called Schedule C, which is filed with your 1040. The “bottom-line amount” from Schedule C is then transferred to your personal tax return. This is especially attractive because business losses you suffer may offset the income you have earned from your other sources. There are a few disadvantages to consider. Selecting the sole proprietorship business structure means you're personally responsible for your company’s liabilities, so you're placing your assets at risk, and they could be seized to satisfy a business debt or a legal claim filed against you. Raising money for a sole proprietorship can also be difficult. Banks and other financing sources may be reluctant to make business loans to sole proprietorships. In most cases, you'll have to depend on your financing sources, such as savings, home equity, or family loans. If your business will be owned and operated by several individuals, you’ll want to take a look at structuring your business as either a general partnership or a limited partnership. In a general partnership, the partners manage the company and assume responsibility for the partnership’s debts and other obligations. A limited partnership has both general and limited partners. The general partners own and operate the business and assume liability for the partnership, while the limited partners serve as investors only; they have no control over the company and are not subject to the same liabilities as the general partners. Unless you expect to have many passive investors, limited partnerships generally aren't the best choice for a new business because of all the required filings and administrative complexities. One of the major advantages of a partnership is the tax treatment it enjoys. A partnership doesn't pay tax on its income but “passes through” any profits or losses to the individual partners. On the other hand, personal liability is a major concern if you choose a general partnership. Like sole proprietors, general partners are personally liable for the partnership’s obligations and debts. The corporate structure is more complex and expensive than most other business structures. A corporation is an independent legal entity, separate from its owners, and as such, it requires complying with more regulations and tax requirements. The biggest benefit for a business owner is the liability protection the business owner receives. A corporation’s debt is not considered that of its owners, so if you organize your business as a corporation, you're not putting your personal assets at risk. A corporation also can retain some of its profits without the owner paying tax on them. Another plus is the ability of a corporation to raise money. A corporation can sell stock to raise funds. Corporations also continue indefinitely, even if one of the shareholders dies, sells the shares or becomes disabled. The corporate structure, however, comes with a number of downsides. A major one is higher costs. Corporations are formed under the laws of each state with its own set of regulations. You'll probably need the assistance of an attorney to guide you. In addition, because a corporation must follow more complex rules and regulations than a partnership or sole proprietorship, it requires more accounting and tax preparation services. Another drawback to forming a corporation: Owners of the corporation pay a double tax on the business’s earnings.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the activity of businesses that are subject to the individual income tax has grown compared with that of businesses subject to the corporate income tax. That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:\nThis report was prepared by Paul Burnham of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division.\n\n[This is the third post in a seven-part series discussing the characteristics of limited liability companies and comparing them to the characteristics of corporations, general partnerships, and sole proprietorships. Here's the entire list. Part 1. Background on sole proprietorships. Part 2. Background on partnerships. Part 3. Background on corporations. Part 4. LLCs are distinct legal entities, separate from their owners. Part 5. A limited liability company's owners are not liable for the LLC's obligations. Part 6. Options for an LLC's management structure. Part 7. Options for an LLC's tax treatment.] Let's get back to our trek toward a discussion of the basics of limited liability companies. The first two types of business structures we've looked at -- sole proprietorships and partnerships -- have two significant features in common. First, the owner or owners are liable for the obligations of the business. Second, the business itself does not pay taxes. Instead, the income and other tax items are \"passed through\" to the owner or owners, who pay tax on the income. Things change with corporations, the third type of business structure. Although corporations are not as old as sole proprietorships or partnerships, business organizations with at least some of the characteristics of corporations have been around for centuries. For example, the oldest corporation in North America, Hudson's Bay Company, was incorporated in 1670. Perhaps the most important feature of a corporation is that the owners of the corporation -- called stockholders or shareholders -- are NOT liable for the obligations of the business. And that's very good news for people who owned stock in Lehman Brothers, which melted down into the largest bankruptcy in American history. Or, going back a little further to previous record holders, people who owned stock in Enron and Worldcom. Even though the people who owned stock in those corporations may have lost everything they invested, they were not liable to the corporations' creditors, and they did not get pulled into the corporate bankruptcies. That protection against shareholders being held liable for the corporation's obligations is sometimes called a liability shield or a corporate veil, and it doesn't exist for sole proprietorships or general partnerships.\n\nStart a Business\nStarting a business is similar to building an actual building. Just like a real building, the structure will impact the purpose. How well your business structure fits your goals matters. It affects ownership and transfer, taxes, and the ability to get credit. The form guides the direction your business will develop. The most common structures are:\nTry our BUSINESS STRUCTURE WIZARD\nto discover the best structure for you. Best of all, it's FREE! This type is based on personal ownership. Property and liabilities are held in someone's name. This can be either an individual (normally) or a married couple. Home businesses often use this type. It is simple and cheap. Business taxes are filed as personal income. Liability is also personal, which is a disadvantage. In most areas, starting a sole proprietorship is as easy as filing a DBA (Doing Business As). Some locations (and types of businesses) may require other licensing. Fees are minimal. Required records are similar to personal tax records. The most basic mirrors a sole proprietorship. The key document is the partnership agreement. This spells out the division of ownership. In a General Partnership, the responsibilities are shared across partners. Management duties and profits are shared as well. There are no direct taxes on a partnership; taxes are handled as personal taxes on each partner. There are other, special types of partnerships. These are more like corporations. Limited Liability Partnerships, Professional Partnerships and Limited Partnerships give more flexibility and alter liability. This is a more complex legal structure. The key difference is that a corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners. Ownership is through stock in the company. Stock may be privately held or public. The ability to offer stock for sale is an advantage. It allows for financing outside of direct loans. Another advantage is the protection a corporation offers by limiting liability. Startup costs are higher with a corporation. There are more formalities and regulation issues. Taxes are also business based instead of individual. This subtype of corporation has one advantage over a C Corp. Taxes are paid like they are for partnerships. IRS requirements must be met, but the S Corp taxing method is a benefit. Other advantages of a C Corp are retained. This form combines the advantages of a corporation and those of a partnership or sole proprietorship. It doesn’t require the formal structure of a ‘real’ corporation, but still limits owner liability. Taxes are done as they are for a partnership (or sole proprietorship). One disadvantage is the inability to issue stock to raise capital. This is a type of corporation dedicated to some civic, religious, educational, or charitable goal. They are tax exempt. A board of directors (or trustees) is required. One particularity of non profits is that they cannot be sold, but their assets must be transferred to another non profit if they are dissolved. This is available to some professions, depending on the state. It is a limited liability type of corporation where all the shareholders also hold a professional license. Doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals might find this an attractive choice because it limits their personal liability. Plus, you get a 100% MONEY-BACK Guarantee *\n\nSmall business owners who are deciding whether to form a corporation versus a limited liability company (LLC) must take into account many factors. One of those factors is whether the choice will result in any significant income tax savings for the owners. That requires a basic understanding of how each business structure is taxed by the federal and state governments. When making your ultimate decision — not only on whether to form an LLC or corporation — but how you want that LLC or corporation to be taxed (you’ll have options), you should consider, among others, the following tax issues:\n- The income tax rate for corporations and individuals — both federal and state\n- Self-employment taxes if any of the owners will also work for the company\n- Retirement plans, if the owners want to establish them\n- Fringe benefits for the owners and employees\nLLCs and corporations provide their owners with limited personal liability regardless of how they are taxed\nMost small business owners decide to form an LLC or corporation to own their business, rather than owning the business in their own names, to limit their personal liability. LLCs and corporations are both legal entities that have an existence separate from their owners (called shareholders in the case of a corporation and members in the case of an LLC). And all state corporation statutes and LLC statutes provide that corporations and LLCs are liable for their own debts and the shareholders and members are not personally liable based on their status as owners of the entity. Therefore, the choice of an LLC or a corporation will not be based on which provides limited liability. They both do. And the choice of how that corporation or LLC is taxed for income tax purposes has no effect on that limitation of personal liability. Note: Limited liability refers to a separation between business and personal assets. Don’t confuse IRS tax classification with the type of entity you formed — an LLC is always an LLC, and a corporation is always a corporation\nSome small business owners misunderstand the relationship between tax status and entity status. As we will discuss, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) does not have one chapter dealing with corporations and one chapter dealing with LLCs. In fact, the IRC does not even mention LLCs. Instead, as a default rule, an LLC with one member will be taxed in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, while an LLC with more than one member will be taxed in the same manner as a partnership. In addition, an LLC can elect to be taxed as a corporation. However, regardless of how the members decide to have the LLC taxed, it remains an LLC. An LLC’s tax classification has no effect on it being an LLC. Similarly, even if the LLC members elect to have the LLC taxed in the same manner as a corporation, it’s still an LLC. It’s just an LLC that has opted out of its default income tax classification. In addition, the IRC has two different corporation tax classifications — a corporation may be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation (more on that later). But that is solely an income tax distinction. For the purposes of the state corporation law, and any purpose other than income tax, a corporation is just a corporation and it doesn’t matter if it is taxed as a C corporation or S corporation. How are corporations taxed under the IRC? By default, all corporations are taxed under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. These are referred to as C corporations. “By default” means that if the shareholders do nothing, this is how their corporation will be taxed. “Default” also means that there are other options. And indeed there is another option. If all the shareholders so decide, and the corporation qualifies, it can be taxed under Subchapter S of the IRC. These are referred to as S corporations. How are C corporations taxed? A C corporation is a separate taxpaying entity. The corporation must file a separate corporate tax return, Form 1120, and pay its own taxes. A C corporation computes its taxable income before deducting or paying any dividends to shareholders. Therefore, the dividend is taxed at the corporate level. In addition, when the corporation pays a dividend (a distribution to the owners of current year earnings or accumulated earnings), the dividend is taxable to the owner upon receipt. Thus, in effect, the dividend is taxed twice. Double taxation is considered the main disadvantage of being taxed as a C corporation.\n\nBusiness Legal & Tax Structure Evaluation\nOne important consideration when starting your business is determining the best legal organizational structure. Why? Because it will affect operating efficiency, transferability, control, the way you report income, the taxes you pay and your personal liability. Our team of CPAs and business advisors can evaluate your unique business and determine which structure is best for you and avoid potentials problems. After determining the best entity for your business, it will be critical to operate within the guidelines of the specific type of business to avoid losing elections or piercing a corporate veil. Five Basic Business Structure Types Are Available\n- A hybrid type of legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership\n- The ‘owners’ are referred to as ‘members.’ Depending on the state, the members can consist of a single individual (one owner), two or more individuals. corporations or other LLCs\n- Unlike shareholders in a corporation. in most states LLCs are not taxed as a separate business entity. Instead, all profits and losses are “passed through’ the business to each member of the LLC. LLC members report profits and losses on their personal federal tax returns, just like the owners of a partnership would\n- To form an LLC, you must file the appropriate documents with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- The simplest legal structure for any business\n- The business is not legally separated from you — me owner. (By default, the legal business name is the same as your legal name)\n- Establishing a business name separate from your own is possible by creating a “doing business as\" (DBA) name. Most states require DBAs to be registered with the county clerk or Secretary of State\n- Owner can take cash withdrawals from the business at will\n- Owner required to make quarterly estimated tax payments\n- Establishing a sole proprietorship may be as simple as opening a bank account for the business\n- Some states and municipalities may require obtaining a license or permit\n- Like a sole proprietorship, a general partnership is not a legal entity separate from its owners\n- The difference between a sole proprietorship and partnership is that a sole proprietorship has only one owner and a partnership has two or more owners\n- Owners can take withdrawals and, if specified in the partnership, guaranteed payments\n- Owners pay taxes quarterly\n- Can be started through an oral agreement, though a written agreement is advisable (and required in some states)\n- Many states have legal provisions for limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that provide for some limitations on the liability of the owners and on points such as profit\/loss percentages; business decisions; addition and withdrawal of a partner and terms of operation\n- Some partnership allocation structures may subject you and your business to heightened Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutiny\n- To form a partnership. you must register your business with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s ofﬁce\n- A separate legal entity from its owners\n- Corporate documents are filed with the state and an annual fee is paid\n- Separate corporate bank accounts and records are created, and assets and money generated by the corporation are owned by the corporation\n- Corporations are required to pay federal, state and, in some cases, local taxes\n- Most businesses must register with the IRS and state and local revenue agencies. Although any business that has employees will need to get a tax ID number, it is required for a corporation\n- Unlike sole proprietors and partnerships, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporations are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns\n- Shareholders who also are employees pay income tax on their wages. The corporation and the employee each pay one half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. but this usually is a deductible business expense for the corporation\n- To form a corporation, you must file articles of incorporation with you state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- A corporation with the Subchapter S designation from the IRS\n- To be considered an S corp, you must first charter a business as a corporation in the state where it is headquartered\n- An S corp is different from a C corp in that its profits and losses can pass though to the owner’s personal tax return. Consequently, the business is not taxed itself. Only the shareholders are taxed.\n\nLiquidations and Dissolutions: Critical Tax Implications for Businesses\nProactive Steps to Minimize Negative Income Tax Consequences\nRecording of a 110-minute CPE\/CLE webinar with Q&A\nThis CLE webinar will update advisors' awareness of the key federal income tax implications throughout the business dissolution or liquidation processes, and offer alternative tax compliance and tax planning strategies. - Differences in dissolutions vs. liquidations\n- When a company legally remains in business even though it has dissolved\n- Whether a company’s status as a corporation is ended by an administrative dissolution\n- Distribution of gains and losses to shareholders in a liquidation\n- Taxation at both the business and shareholder levels in a liquidation\n- Tax issues of common transactions in a dissolution or liquidation\n- Shareholder loans to a from a business\n- Handling contingent liabilities\n- Working with different state processes for dissolving a business\n- Errors and omissions in a depreciation schedule\n- Possible tax planning issues\n- Tax differences between repossession of assets for debt payment, and debt forgiveness\n- Timing of sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss to offset gains on sales of zero- or low-basis assets\n- Timing sales of assets with payment of deductible business expenses, to avoid large Schedule F losses in one year and large gains in another\n- Tax consequences of converting from C corporation to S corporation or LLC, and vice versa\nThe panel will cover these and other relevant topics:\n- Understanding the tax differences between administrative dissolution and liquidation, and whether it's possible for a business to close without suffering the tax bite of complete liquidation. - Employing tax strategies to handle commonplace transactions such as shareholder loans to and from a business and contingent liabilities. - Undertaking tax planning for higher-level issues — such as timing sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss, sale of assets to offset payment of deductible business expenses, or a partner buyout through stock redemption.

Chris, Arlington VA\nA: In my article on business entity choice, I go into the advantages and disadvantages of the three major forms of business entity formation: the sole proprietorship, the S-corporation, and the corporation. Today I will focus on the corporation... The corporation is the oldest and in many ways the best form of business entity to choose. A few things to get out of the way before really diving in, though:\n- It doesn't matter for tax purposes where you form your corporation. Whether you form it in Delaware, Nevada, or anywhere else, taxes must be paid. You will owe corporate income tax to the federal government, and you will owe state income tax based on where you do business. Where you actually incorporate matters much more for purposes of setting up strong protections between corporate activity and shareholder liability, which you may not need. - An LLC is a disregarded tax entity. That is, filing for one and doing nothing else will result in the LLC being taxed as a sole proprietorship (partnership if more than one LLC member). However, an LLC can easily be taxed as any other type of entity--usually an S-corporation or a corporation. As a practical matter, I advise clients to form an LLC to get the legal protection, and then elect for the LLC to be taxed in the manner that makes sense for that client. For the purposes of this discussion, \"corporation\" can mean an actual corporation or an LLC taxed as one. \"Incorporation\" means either the onerous incorporation process, or the simple LLC filing process. I've said before that the best profile of a business ready to be taxed as a corporation is one with consistently at least $20,000 in profits and which has an accounting regime strict enough not to commingle business and personal receipts, expenditures, assets, and liabilities. For companies too small to be worth the effort, stick to a sole proprietorship. For companies big enough but too undisciplined in accounting, stick to an S-corporation. A corporation is a separate tax entity that pays its own taxes. Receipts are calculated and expenses are deducted. All of the same advantages given to other businesses (expensing, accelerated depreciation, etc.) are also available to corporations under the same rules. Contributions of capital or other property to the corporation by shareholders give basis to the shareholders. In the same way, distributions of this capital reduce basis. If the corporation is sold, this basis may result in less capital gains tax getting paid. A corporation has maximum freedom to pay fringe benefits. That means it can pay for a workplace retirement plan of up to 25% of compensation, and there are no separate limits on health expenses, HSA costs, and other fringes. In general, these rules are much more restrictive for the other two entity types. Once taxable income is calculated, there may be a gain or a loss. If there is a net operating loss, it may be carried back up to two years, or carried forward for up to 20. Prior year returns may be amended, and taxes can be refunded. If there is positive taxable income, tax is paid. The top corporate rate is 35%, but there is a graduated structure. The first $50,000 of corporate taxable income is taxed at a 15% rate, and income between $50,001-$75,000 is taxed at a 25% rate. As a result, corporate shareholders can essentially benefit from two separate and distinct graduated tax brackets (personal and corporate). The full corporate income tax bracket structure can be seen in the left-hand column of this page. A corporation can elect at its formation to have a tax year different from the calendar year. The advantage here is that a taxpayer can straddle income and expenses between his personal tax year (which must end on December 31), and his corporate tax year (which can end in any month). In practice, I have never seen this to be worth it--but it is available. A corporation can donate up to 10% of its taxable income to charity as a deduction, with a future-year rollover. There are a few concerns to be aware of when dealing with corporations:\n- Unlike sole proprietorships or S-corporations, corporate shareholders cannot simply \"ATM\" the corporate account without some tax consequences.","passages":[{"passage":"As a small business owner, it's important to understand the tax implications of your business decisions. Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities.

Whenever you start a business, you will have to select one organizational type from out of all the different business structures. This choice determines how your business will be set up and organized. In most instances, you will probably have to choose between a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, a corporation, or a sole proprietorship. There are some criteria that you can use to find the business structure that works the best for your purpose. These criteria are:\nThe general rule for this category is that the more dangerous or risky the activity that your business will engage in, the less personal liability you want to have. Both corporations and LLCs allow business owners a type of \"limited liability,\" where anyone seeking claims against the business will have a very hard time placing personal liability on you as the owner. Conversely, if you were to organize your business as a partnership or a sole proprietorship, you could be personally responsible for anything the business did wrong. Expenses and Procedures\nIn general, there is no special paperwork that needs to be filed in order to establish either of these business structures. In addition, there are rarely any fees associated with establishing or maintaining either of these business structures. LLCs and corporations, on the other hand, are almost always more difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. In order to establish a corporation or limited liability company, you must file \"Articles of Incorporation\" with your secretary of state and pay fees associated with the incorporation. The details of the articles of incorporation and the amount of the fee will vary depending upon the state where you set up your business. In addition, when deciding to form a corporation or LLC, the owners of the business must decide which officers to elect to run the company. LLCs and corporations must keep specific and detailed records of any important business decisions, and follow many other formalities that are associated with these business structures. The easiest way to think about the different income tax structures that these business structures will use is to break them into two categories -- one comprised of those business structures where the business owners pay taxes on business profits, and one that includes all business structures where the business owners do not pay taxes on business profits. The first category includes sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs. These business structures are often referred to as \"pass-through\" tax entities because the taxes on the business profits and losses pass through to the business owners on their personal income taxes. Business owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs must report and pay taxes on all net profits from their business, even if they take no money out of the business' account during the tax year. Unlike the pass through tax businesses, the owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on the net business profits of the corporation. Instead, the business owners of a corporation pay taxes only on the profits they actually take from the corporation in the form of salaries, dividends and bonuses. Because a corporation is a separate tax entity, it must pay taxes on any profits that remain within the company during a tax year, and also on any profits that it pays out in the form of dividends to shareholders. There is a tax benefit to forming your business as a corporation. The owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on any profits that the corporation keeps, and the corporation pays taxes at a lower rate than do some individuals. Structuring a business as a corporation allows a business to sell shares of ownership in the business through stock offerings. This is different than the other three business structures, which do not allow the selling of part of the business through the sale of stocks. Because of this investment scheme, it may allow owners of a corporation to attract investors and retain employees more easily by offering stock. If you never plan on having your business go on sale to the public, however, and don't need the investment incentives to retain employees, you probably do not need to go through the added procedure and cost of forming a corporation. If you desire the limited personal liability that comes from a corporation, you could instead form your business as a LLC. An LLC provides many of the advantages of a corporation while remaining more flexible.

In their book, Start Your Own Business, the staff of Entrepreneur Media Inc. guides you through the critical steps to starting a business, then supports you in surviving the first three years as a business owner. In this edited excerpt, the authors briefly review the different legal business structures you may want to choose for your small business. Of all the decisions you make when starting a business, one of the most important ones is the type of legal structure you select for your company. Not only will this decision have an impact on how much you pay in taxes, but it will affect the amount of paperwork your business is required to do, the personal liability you face and your ability to raise money. The simplest structure is the sole proprietorship, which usually involves just one individual who owns and operates the enterprise. With a sole proprietorship, your business earnings are taxed only once, unlike other business structures. Another big plus is that you will have complete control over your business—you make all the decisions. The tax aspects of a sole proprietorship are appealing because the expenses and your income from the business are included on your personal income tax return, Form 1040. Your profits and losses are recorded on a form called Schedule C, which is filed with your 1040. The “bottom-line amount” from Schedule C is then transferred to your personal tax return. This is especially attractive because business losses you suffer may offset the income you have earned from your other sources. There are a few disadvantages to consider. Selecting the sole proprietorship business structure means you're personally responsible for your company’s liabilities, so you're placing your assets at risk, and they could be seized to satisfy a business debt or a legal claim filed against you. Raising money for a sole proprietorship can also be difficult. Banks and other financing sources may be reluctant to make business loans to sole proprietorships. In most cases, you'll have to depend on your financing sources, such as savings, home equity, or family loans. If your business will be owned and operated by several individuals, you’ll want to take a look at structuring your business as either a general partnership or a limited partnership. In a general partnership, the partners manage the company and assume responsibility for the partnership’s debts and other obligations. A limited partnership has both general and limited partners. The general partners own and operate the business and assume liability for the partnership, while the limited partners serve as investors only; they have no control over the company and are not subject to the same liabilities as the general partners. Unless you expect to have many passive investors, limited partnerships generally aren't the best choice for a new business because of all the required filings and administrative complexities. One of the major advantages of a partnership is the tax treatment it enjoys. A partnership doesn't pay tax on its income but “passes through” any profits or losses to the individual partners. On the other hand, personal liability is a major concern if you choose a general partnership. Like sole proprietors, general partners are personally liable for the partnership’s obligations and debts. The corporate structure is more complex and expensive than most other business structures. A corporation is an independent legal entity, separate from its owners, and as such, it requires complying with more regulations and tax requirements. The biggest benefit for a business owner is the liability protection the business owner receives. A corporation’s debt is not considered that of its owners, so if you organize your business as a corporation, you're not putting your personal assets at risk. A corporation also can retain some of its profits without the owner paying tax on them. Another plus is the ability of a corporation to raise money. A corporation can sell stock to raise funds. Corporations also continue indefinitely, even if one of the shareholders dies, sells the shares or becomes disabled. The corporate structure, however, comes with a number of downsides. A major one is higher costs. Corporations are formed under the laws of each state with its own set of regulations. You'll probably need the assistance of an attorney to guide you. In addition, because a corporation must follow more complex rules and regulations than a partnership or sole proprietorship, it requires more accounting and tax preparation services. Another drawback to forming a corporation: Owners of the corporation pay a double tax on the business’s earnings.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f791fc24-a91f-4e4c-b822-b5316b13faa9>"]},{"passage":"Over the past 30 years, the activity of businesses that are subject to the individual income tax has grown compared with that of businesses subject to the corporate income tax. That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:\nThis report was prepared by Paul Burnham of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4ac0a158-31cd-499a-b409-6434a4906983>"]},{"passage":"[This is the third post in a seven-part series discussing the characteristics of limited liability companies and comparing them to the characteristics of corporations, general partnerships, and sole proprietorships. Here's the entire list. Part 1. Background on sole proprietorships. Part 2. Background on partnerships. Part 3. Background on corporations. Part 4. LLCs are distinct legal entities, separate from their owners. Part 5. A limited liability company's owners are not liable for the LLC's obligations. Part 6. Options for an LLC's management structure. Part 7. Options for an LLC's tax treatment.] Let's get back to our trek toward a discussion of the basics of limited liability companies. The first two types of business structures we've looked at -- sole proprietorships and partnerships -- have two significant features in common. First, the owner or owners are liable for the obligations of the business. Second, the business itself does not pay taxes. Instead, the income and other tax items are \"passed through\" to the owner or owners, who pay tax on the income. Things change with corporations, the third type of business structure. Although corporations are not as old as sole proprietorships or partnerships, business organizations with at least some of the characteristics of corporations have been around for centuries. For example, the oldest corporation in North America, Hudson's Bay Company, was incorporated in 1670. Perhaps the most important feature of a corporation is that the owners of the corporation -- called stockholders or shareholders -- are NOT liable for the obligations of the business. And that's very good news for people who owned stock in Lehman Brothers, which melted down into the largest bankruptcy in American history. Or, going back a little further to previous record holders, people who owned stock in Enron and Worldcom. Even though the people who owned stock in those corporations may have lost everything they invested, they were not liable to the corporations' creditors, and they did not get pulled into the corporate bankruptcies. That protection against shareholders being held liable for the corporation's obligations is sometimes called a liability shield or a corporate veil, and it doesn't exist for sole proprietorships or general partnerships.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5197e44d-818d-4d1e-8bba-d713f8d18665>"]},{"passage":"Start a Business\nStarting a business is similar to building an actual building.

This type is based on personal ownership. Property and liabilities are held in someone's name. This can be either an individual (normally) or a married couple. Home businesses often use this type. It is simple and cheap. Business taxes are filed as personal income. Liability is also personal, which is a disadvantage. In most areas, starting a sole proprietorship is as easy as filing a DBA (Doing Business As). Some locations (and types of businesses) may require other licensing. Fees are minimal. Required records are similar to personal tax records. The most basic mirrors a sole proprietorship. The key document is the partnership agreement. This spells out the division of ownership. In a General Partnership, the responsibilities are shared across partners. Management duties and profits are shared as well. There are no direct taxes on a partnership; taxes are handled as personal taxes on each partner. There are other, special types of partnerships. These are more like corporations. Limited Liability Partnerships, Professional Partnerships and Limited Partnerships give more flexibility and alter liability. This is a more complex legal structure. The key difference is that a corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners. Ownership is through stock in the company. Stock may be privately held or public. The ability to offer stock for sale is an advantage. It allows for financing outside of direct loans. Another advantage is the protection a corporation offers by limiting liability. Startup costs are higher with a corporation. There are more formalities and regulation issues. Taxes are also business based instead of individual. This subtype of corporation has one advantage over a C Corp. Taxes are paid like they are for partnerships. IRS requirements must be met, but the S Corp taxing method is a benefit. Other advantages of a C Corp are retained. This form combines the advantages of a corporation and those of a partnership or sole proprietorship. It doesn’t require the formal structure of a ‘real’ corporation, but still limits owner liability. Taxes are done as they are for a partnership (or sole proprietorship). One disadvantage is the inability to issue stock to raise capital. This is a type of corporation dedicated to some civic, religious, educational, or charitable goal. They are tax exempt. A board of directors (or trustees) is required. One particularity of non profits is that they cannot be sold, but their assets must be transferred to another non profit if they are dissolved. This is available to some professions, depending on the state. It is a limited liability type of corporation where all the shareholders also hold a professional license. Doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals might find this an attractive choice because it limits their personal liability.

One of those factors is whether the choice will result in any significant income tax savings for the owners. That requires a basic understanding of how each business structure is taxed by the federal and state governments. When making your ultimate decision — not only on whether to form an LLC or corporation — but how you want that LLC or corporation to be taxed (you’ll have options), you should consider, among others, the following tax issues:\n- The income tax rate for corporations and individuals — both federal and state\n- Self-employment taxes if any of the owners will also work for the company\n- Retirement plans, if the owners want to establish them\n- Fringe benefits for the owners and employees\nLLCs and corporations provide their owners with limited personal liability regardless of how they are taxed\nMost small business owners decide to form an LLC or corporation to own their business, rather than owning the business in their own names, to limit their personal liability. LLCs and corporations are both legal entities that have an existence separate from their owners (called shareholders in the case of a corporation and members in the case of an LLC). And all state corporation statutes and LLC statutes provide that corporations and LLCs are liable for their own debts and the shareholders and members are not personally liable based on their status as owners of the entity. Therefore, the choice of an LLC or a corporation will not be based on which provides limited liability. They both do. And the choice of how that corporation or LLC is taxed for income tax purposes has no effect on that limitation of personal liability. Note: Limited liability refers to a separation between business and personal assets. Don’t confuse IRS tax classification with the type of entity you formed — an LLC is always an LLC, and a corporation is always a corporation\nSome small business owners misunderstand the relationship between tax status and entity status. As we will discuss, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) does not have one chapter dealing with corporations and one chapter dealing with LLCs. In fact, the IRC does not even mention LLCs. Instead, as a default rule, an LLC with one member will be taxed in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, while an LLC with more than one member will be taxed in the same manner as a partnership. In addition, an LLC can elect to be taxed as a corporation. However, regardless of how the members decide to have the LLC taxed, it remains an LLC. An LLC’s tax classification has no effect on it being an LLC. Similarly, even if the LLC members elect to have the LLC taxed in the same manner as a corporation, it’s still an LLC. It’s just an LLC that has opted out of its default income tax classification. In addition, the IRC has two different corporation tax classifications — a corporation may be taxed as a C corporation or an S corporation (more on that later). But that is solely an income tax distinction. For the purposes of the state corporation law, and any purpose other than income tax, a corporation is just a corporation and it doesn’t matter if it is taxed as a C corporation or S corporation. How are corporations taxed under the IRC? By default, all corporations are taxed under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. These are referred to as C corporations. “By default” means that if the shareholders do nothing, this is how their corporation will be taxed. “Default” also means that there are other options. And indeed there is another option. If all the shareholders so decide, and the corporation qualifies, it can be taxed under Subchapter S of the IRC. These are referred to as S corporations. How are C corporations taxed? A C corporation is a separate taxpaying entity. The corporation must file a separate corporate tax return, Form 1120, and pay its own taxes. A C corporation computes its taxable income before deducting or paying any dividends to shareholders. Therefore, the dividend is taxed at the corporate level. In addition, when the corporation pays a dividend (a distribution to the owners of current year earnings or accumulated earnings), the dividend is taxable to the owner upon receipt. Thus, in effect, the dividend is taxed twice. Double taxation is considered the main disadvantage of being taxed as a C corporation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dae7be87-6a39-446c-b832-50cb29cdf5f7>"]},{"passage":"Business Legal & Tax Structure Evaluation\nOne important consideration when starting your business is determining the best legal organizational structure.

LLC members report profits and losses on their personal federal tax returns, just like the owners of a partnership would\n- To form an LLC, you must file the appropriate documents with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- The simplest legal structure for any business\n- The business is not legally separated from you — me owner. (By default, the legal business name is the same as your legal name)\n- Establishing a business name separate from your own is possible by creating a “doing business as\" (DBA) name. Most states require DBAs to be registered with the county clerk or Secretary of State\n- Owner can take cash withdrawals from the business at will\n- Owner required to make quarterly estimated tax payments\n- Establishing a sole proprietorship may be as simple as opening a bank account for the business\n- Some states and municipalities may require obtaining a license or permit\n- Like a sole proprietorship, a general partnership is not a legal entity separate from its owners\n- The difference between a sole proprietorship and partnership is that a sole proprietorship has only one owner and a partnership has two or more owners\n- Owners can take withdrawals and, if specified in the partnership, guaranteed payments\n- Owners pay taxes quarterly\n- Can be started through an oral agreement, though a written agreement is advisable (and required in some states)\n- Many states have legal provisions for limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that provide for some limitations on the liability of the owners and on points such as profit\/loss percentages; business decisions; addition and withdrawal of a partner and terms of operation\n- Some partnership allocation structures may subject you and your business to heightened Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutiny\n- To form a partnership. you must register your business with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s ofﬁce\n- A separate legal entity from its owners\n- Corporate documents are filed with the state and an annual fee is paid\n- Separate corporate bank accounts and records are created, and assets and money generated by the corporation are owned by the corporation\n- Corporations are required to pay federal, state and, in some cases, local taxes\n- Most businesses must register with the IRS and state and local revenue agencies. Although any business that has employees will need to get a tax ID number, it is required for a corporation\n- Unlike sole proprietors and partnerships, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporations are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns\n- Shareholders who also are employees pay income tax on their wages. The corporation and the employee each pay one half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. but this usually is a deductible business expense for the corporation\n- To form a corporation, you must file articles of incorporation with you state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- A corporation with the Subchapter S designation from the IRS\n- To be considered an S corp, you must first charter a business as a corporation in the state where it is headquartered\n- An S corp is different from a C corp in that its profits and losses can pass though to the owner’s personal tax return. Consequently, the business is not taxed itself. Only the shareholders are taxed.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fb6cc359-66e6-4fef-b255-694f181f9487>"]},{"passage":"Liquidations and Dissolutions: Critical Tax Implications for Businesses\nProactive Steps to Minimize Negative Income Tax Consequences\nRecording of a 110-minute CPE\/CLE webinar with Q&A\nThis CLE webinar will update advisors' awareness of the key federal income tax implications throughout the business dissolution or liquidation processes, and offer alternative tax compliance and tax planning strategies. - Differences in dissolutions vs. liquidations\n- When a company legally remains in business even though it has dissolved\n- Whether a company’s status as a corporation is ended by an administrative dissolution\n- Distribution of gains and losses to shareholders in a liquidation\n- Taxation at both the business and shareholder levels in a liquidation\n- Tax issues of common transactions in a dissolution or liquidation\n- Shareholder loans to a from a business\n- Handling contingent liabilities\n- Working with different state processes for dissolving a business\n- Errors and omissions in a depreciation schedule\n- Possible tax planning issues\n- Tax differences between repossession of assets for debt payment, and debt forgiveness\n- Timing of sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss to offset gains on sales of zero- or low-basis assets\n- Timing sales of assets with payment of deductible business expenses, to avoid large Schedule F losses in one year and large gains in another\n- Tax consequences of converting from C corporation to S corporation or LLC, and vice versa\nThe panel will cover these and other relevant topics:\n- Understanding the tax differences between administrative dissolution and liquidation, and whether it's possible for a business to close without suffering the tax bite of complete liquidation. - Employing tax strategies to handle commonplace transactions such as shareholder loans to and from a business and contingent liabilities. - Undertaking tax planning for higher-level issues — such as timing sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss, sale of assets to offset payment of deductible business expenses, or a partner buyout through stock redemption.

What about regular, old-fashioned corporations? Chris, Arlington VA\nA: In my article on business entity choice, I go into the advantages and disadvantages of the three major forms of business entity formation: the sole proprietorship, the S-corporation, and the corporation. Today I will focus on the corporation... The corporation is the oldest and in many ways the best form of business entity to choose. A few things to get out of the way before really diving in, though:\n- It doesn't matter for tax purposes where you form your corporation. Whether you form it in Delaware, Nevada, or anywhere else, taxes must be paid. You will owe corporate income tax to the federal government, and you will owe state income tax based on where you do business. Where you actually incorporate matters much more for purposes of setting up strong protections between corporate activity and shareholder liability, which you may not need. - An LLC is a disregarded tax entity. That is, filing for one and doing nothing else will result in the LLC being taxed as a sole proprietorship (partnership if more than one LLC member). However, an LLC can easily be taxed as any other type of entity--usually an S-corporation or a corporation. As a practical matter, I advise clients to form an LLC to get the legal protection, and then elect for the LLC to be taxed in the manner that makes sense for that client. For the purposes of this discussion, \"corporation\" can mean an actual corporation or an LLC taxed as one. \"Incorporation\" means either the onerous incorporation process, or the simple LLC filing process. I've said before that the best profile of a business ready to be taxed as a corporation is one with consistently at least $20,000 in profits and which has an accounting regime strict enough not to commingle business and personal receipts, expenditures, assets, and liabilities. For companies too small to be worth the effort, stick to a sole proprietorship. For companies big enough but too undisciplined in accounting, stick to an S-corporation. A corporation is a separate tax entity that pays its own taxes. Receipts are calculated and expenses are deducted. All of the same advantages given to other businesses (expensing, accelerated depreciation, etc.) are also available to corporations under the same rules. Contributions of capital or other property to the corporation by shareholders give basis to the shareholders. In the same way, distributions of this capital reduce basis. If the corporation is sold, this basis may result in less capital gains tax getting paid. A corporation has maximum freedom to pay fringe benefits. That means it can pay for a workplace retirement plan of up to 25% of compensation, and there are no separate limits on health expenses, HSA costs, and other fringes. In general, these rules are much more restrictive for the other two entity types. Once taxable income is calculated, there may be a gain or a loss. If there is a net operating loss, it may be carried back up to two years, or carried forward for up to 20. Prior year returns may be amended, and taxes can be refunded. If there is positive taxable income, tax is paid. The top corporate rate is 35%, but there is a graduated structure. The first $50,000 of corporate taxable income is taxed at a 15% rate, and income between $50,001-$75,000 is taxed at a 25% rate. As a result, corporate shareholders can essentially benefit from two separate and distinct graduated tax brackets (personal and corporate). The full corporate income tax bracket structure can be seen in the left-hand column of this page. A corporation can elect at its formation to have a tax year different from the calendar year. The advantage here is that a taxpayer can straddle income and expenses between his personal tax year (which must end on December 31), and his corporate tax year (which can end in any month). In practice, I have never seen this to be worth it--but it is available. A corporation can donate up to 10% of its taxable income to charity as a deduction, with a future-year rollover. There are a few concerns to be aware of when dealing with corporations:\n- Unlike sole proprietorships or S-corporations, corporate shareholders cannot simply \"ATM\" the corporate account without some tax consequences.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:619ea1a4-ba76-47f3-86ab-59ccdf78847c>"]}]}

This offers financial security and emotional freedom to focus on recovery.","answer":"Critical illness insurance is a type of health insurance that provides a lump sum payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a covered critical illness. This coverage is distinct from traditional health insurance, which typically covers the costs of treatment and medical care.\n\nHere's how critical illness cover works and the benefits it provides:\n\n1. **Diagnosis**: The insurance policy will specify a list of critical illnesses that are covered. Common conditions may include heart attack, stroke, cancer, organ transplants, and other severe illnesses.\n\n2. **Lump Sum Payment**: If the policyholder is diagnosed with one of the covered conditions, they receive a lump sum payment. This payment is usually made in addition to any other medical benefits that might be available.\n\n3. **Cash Benefit**: The lump sum is intended to help the policyholder manage the financial impact of the illness. This money can be used for various purposes such as medical expenses not covered by other insurance, living expenses, debt repayment, or even for personal use as per the policyholder's choice.\n\n4. **Survival Period**: The policyholder must survive for a certain period after diagnosis, known as the survival period. This period varies depending on the policy and the specific illness. If the policyholder does not survive this period, the lump sum payment is not made.\n\n5. **Waiting Period**: There may also be a waiting period after the diagnosis before the lump sum payment is made. This is to ensure that the diagnosis is confirmed and stable.\n\n6. **Premium Costs**: The cost of critical illness insurance varies based on factors such as the policyholder's age, health status, the amount of coverage chosen, and the specific illnesses covered.\n\n7. **Additional Benefits**: Some policies may offer additional benefits such as waiver of premiums during the period of illness, hospital cash for in-patient treatment, or a second medical opinion.\n\n8. **No Treatment Coverage**: It is important to note that critical illness insurance does not cover the costs of treatment or medical care. It is designed to provide financial support to policyholders who are dealing with the financial implications of a serious illness.\n\n9. **Pre-existing Conditions**: Policies usually have provisions for pre-existing conditions, which may affect eligibility or the amount of coverage provided.\n\n10. **Application and Underwriting**: When applying for critical illness insurance, applicants may undergo a medical examination and underwriting process to assess their health and the risk they pose to the insurer.\n\nCritical illness insurance is often purchased by individuals who want to protect themselves against the financial burden of a serious illness, especially when they are concerned about the potential for high medical expenses or loss of income due to time off work. It is an important consideration for anyone who wants to ensure they have financial security in the face of unexpected health challenges.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Lifestyle diseases are ailments, which occur due to your way of living. These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.\n\n- Toddler Parenting Experts: Play-Based Learning Muna Bago Formal Schooling\n- Toddler Is 'No' Your Toddler's Favorite Word?

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited\/associated hospitals\/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost\/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.\n\nBeing on workcover is a nightmare!

Below are a few tips and tricks that can help you survive the WorkCover nightmare!Focus on your health and recovery\nYour highest priority should always be your health and to maximise your physical and\/or psychological recovery.WorkCover must pay for all reasonable treatment costs. We strongly believe that the most important issue is to ensure that you are getting the best quality medical treatment possible. Related blog articles\n- surviving workcover some more tips\n- workcover survival guide for injured workers\n- on being on workcover and what it’s like\nWhen you are seriously injured, you will have to make many important decisions about your future. To make the right decisions it will be critical to understand as much as you possibly can about the structure of WorkCover benefits, for example, how they interact with your other employment entitlements, and what all your entitlements really are. WorkCover is an extremely complex system! The Act of Parliament which governs WorkCover alone is several hundred pages long and quite complicated. Trying to understand just what WorkCover does and does not provide is really important. There are many resources available to help you with this task. The most detailed information, apart from the Act itself, is on the WorkSafe website which contains a very detailed publication called the ‘Online Claims Manual‘. This contains detailed instructions from WorkCover to its agents on how to handle claims. It also includes very detailed information about the calculation and payment of WorkCover benefits. Remember this information is written from WorkCover’s perspective only. Nonetheless this can be a useful resource for people who want detailed information.Try to deal as best you can with WorkCover\nDealing with WorkCover and -especially- your case manager can be extremely stressful.Following a few simple guidelines can make dealing with WorkCover, and your case manager (and rehab providers) a tad easier. - The most important thing is that you keep good, written records. For example, if you want to claim travel expenses you need to submit details of all your trips to and from doctors, incl train, bus, tram, taxi and parking receipts. If there is an argument about your weekly payments because WorkCover feel you are not looking for work, keeping a record of all your attempts to obtain work can put you in a far better position. - We advice all injured workers to only communicate\/correspond in writing, either via email or via letter\/fax. You do have the right to refuse telephone contact and you also have the right to request that all correspondence\/communications go through your legal representative, one of your doctors or an advocate. You can even put a “restraining” order on your harassing, bullying and\/or intimidating case manager (see our workcover tips collection for sample letters). - It’s also very important that you keep a copy of all your documents. For example, when you receive a certificate of incapacity, the original should be provided to your employer but ensure you make a copy for your own records. - Ask under the Freedom of Information Act or the Workers Compensation Act, for a copy of all your medical reports, including independent medical examination reports. - When submitting your medical certificates ensure that you complete the section on the back of the certificate about your work activities. If you don’t it will delay your payments and the form will be sent back to you. It may also be useful to try and ensure that your certificates expire on a Saturday or Sunday to make it easier for WorkCover or your employer to calculate your weekly entitlement. This enables weekly benefits to be paid in whole weeks. - Sometimes (well dare we say “often’) the decisions that a case manager makes can be extremely frustrating. Losing your cool can backfire as you will run the risk of being type cast as difficult or as suffering from a psychological problem!\n\nThe Origins of Medicare\nBefore Medicare’s debut in 1966, millions of Americans were at risk of facing a major medical emergency without access to health insurance. When uninsured older Americans became ill, they only had a handful of options. They could empty their life savings, they could rely on help from friends and family, or they could suffer without proper care. All of that changed when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965 into law. Suddenly, there was a new option for millions of older Americans who couldn’t afford the high costs of health insurance or paying out-of-pocket. Over the past 55 years, Medicare has provided a lifeline to families across the United States, making healthcare more affordable, offering important end-of-life care, and even lowering the national poverty rate. But today’s Medicare is not identical to that which was signed into law in 1965. Most now feel confused when trying to have Medicare explained. It is very difficult to understand for those that are coming into Medicare for the first time. The past five decades have seen major changes and additions to the Medicare system. Today, Medicare is broken up into four major parts, signified by the letters A, B, C, and D.\nOriginal Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage\nFor anyone new to Medicare, it’s essential to understand each part and what it covers. But before we can look at each individual part, it’s important to recognize that Medicare is broken up into two larger categories: Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Medicare Parts A and B are known as Original Medicare because they function the way Medicare was originally setup, with the federal government paying health care costs directly. Medicare Parts C (also known as Medicare Advantage) and D involve private health insurance companies contracting with Medicare to provide benefits to customers. Instead of looking at the differences between these two approaches here, we’ll note them as we examine each individual part. There are a lot of pieces when having Medicare explained. So, let’s begin by looking at Medicare’s first program: Part A. It's Easier if I Explain it to You:\nMedicare Part A: Hospital & Hospice Insurance\nMedicare Part A covers emergency vehicle trips and hospital stays, including a hospital room, food, and any necessary testing. As of January 1, 2020, patients need to pay a $1,408 deductible at the beginning of their stay and Medicare will cover the next 60 days. After that, patients will be required to pay a copay of $335 per day for days 61 through 90. If a patient’s stay extends past the 90 day mark, they must tap into their ‘lifetime reserve days’, a set number of days they can use throughout their lifetime that require a $670 copayment. Besides hospital stays, Medicare Part A also covers rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility for 20 days. Patients can remain in a rehab facility for up to 80 days after this for a copayment of $167.50. This gives injured and ill older Americans the ability to get back on their feet and re-acclimated to normal life before heading home – without draining their life savings. Finally, Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care through a variety of hospice benefits. Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live can receive pain relief medication, symptom control prescriptions, and grief counseling. And Medicare Part A provides these benefits at no cost. The only end-of-life charges that someone with Medicare Part A may incur are outpatient drugs or respite care. To apply for premium-free Medicare Part A, someone must be 65 or older and paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. Those who haven’t paid Medicare taxes for that long (and don’t have a spouse who has either) can buy into the program at a reasonable cost. In addition, anyone who’s under 65 and has received Social Security disability benefits for two years or who is a kidney dialysis or transplant patient can receive Medicare Part A without paying premiums. Part A covers inpatient hospital expenses like surgeries. Part B covers outpatient medical expenses like doctor visits. What Does Medicare Part B Cover? Medicare Part B covers a variety of medical procedures not covered under Part A. Most of the things covered under Part B fall under outpatient procedures.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Insurance Parity\nShare Your Story\nShare your personal experiences with parity implementation.

Saving Money with Chronic Illness; How I Focus on Self Care at Work; Book Review: Take Back Your Life by Tami Stacklehouse (Visi time, 16 visit today) 11 Comments Filed Under: Coping, Fibromyalgia, inspiration, Tips and Tricks Tagged With: .\n\nDealing with a serious illnessShow more\nDealing with a serious illness in the family\nIf someone in your family develops a serious illness they may be unable to work, and money issues can arise. This type of event can be extremely stressful as medical expenses and regular household bills will need to be paid, and it’s often hard to determine how long it could be until they’re well enough to work again. To support your loved one through this difficult time it’s a good idea to help them to put in place a plan to manage their finances. If money is needed to assist the person through this crisis, there are a few different options that can be considered:\n- Review the insurances they hold – if they have trauma cover or health insurance they may be able to claim back a number of expenses. - Check if they have KiwiSaver – they may be eligible for an early withdrawal from their savings due to their ill health and financial circumstances. - Ask them if they have any savings that could be used to help cover costs. - If your loved one doesn’t have any other means of income, and is too sick to work, they could look at applying for government assistance, see the Work and Income website for more information\nSupporting someone who is terminally illShow more\nIf someone you love becomes terminally ill, it’s important that they’re given the opportunity to make arrangements for their estate while they’re still able. This may include reviewing their:\n- life insurance policy - to ensure that loved ones are taken care of if something should happen\n- will - to ensure they’re comfortable with how their assets and savings will be divided up among their nominated beneficiaries. - funeral arrangements - if they choose they can make requests for how the funeral and burial should be carried out. Farewelling a loved oneShow more\nWhen a loved one passes away there are a number of arrangements you’ll need to make. Below are a list of steps you can follow to ensure you’re prepared:\n- Look for any instructions that your loved one may have left (including a funeral policy). - Arrange for a death certificate to be issued by a doctor, you’ll need this later on\n- Start making funeral plans; remember to consider guests that may have to travel a long way to attend. - Tell your friends, relatives and colleagues. The funeral director may be able to help with the death certificate, notifications, and give advice to help you deal with other details. If all this feels overwhelming, it’s a good idea to get help from a friend or family member so you can share the load. Planning for funeral costsShow more\nFuneral costs vary depending on the kind of service and funeral company you use. It’s a good idea to check for funeral preferences in the deceased’s will. Also, ask your funeral director for a detailed quote to understand costs up front. Here are some of the costs you need to consider when planning a funeral:\n- death certificate\n- funeral director fees\n- cemetery plot\n- other expenses, eg. celebrant, clergy, flowers, press notices, the wake. Private health, sickness, accident or life insurance policies may help to pay for funeral and other expenses. If the person who has died had personal insurance, call their insurance company to check what they are covered for in their policy. You may find that the person who has passed away has paid for their funeral in advance. If you think that the deceased may have prepaid their funeral expenses, but cannot find the paper work, talk to their solicitor, or the executor of their will. Settling propertyShow more\nMost people have a will drawn up to inform their loved ones how to divide up their money and possessions after their death. The executor of the will is responsible for distributing the person’s money and assets to those named in the will. People who are names in the will are known as 'beneficiaries'. Generally assets can only be distributed after debts are paid, and once the courts have granted 'probate' or validated the will. The executor will need a number of documents to enable them to administer the will. Try to gather these documents together as soon as possible:\n- banking records\n- credit, charge and store cards\n- taxation records\n- superannuation records\n- records of investments. If there is no will the estate is shared under a formula set by law.

But keep it flexible, because things will change. Start by making a list of everything you need to do -- breaking it up into small parts can make things less daunting -- and then prioritizing. And don't forget the cardinal rule of management: Delegate whenever possible. Know the Facts About Your Diagnosis and Treatment\nBefore you approach colleagues, talk to your doctor specifically about the ways that your illness can affect your career. Here are a few helpful tips to smooth the process:\n- Tell your doctor exactly what your job entails and any unique circumstances you'll be coping with. - If work is a priority, let your doctor know that it's important for you to make decisions that will benefit your health and your job whenever possible. - Ask for general ideas about the ways that your diagnosis, medication or treatment could affect your job performance. - Find out specific details about all of your medications and treatments, including common side effects. How can you manage side effects like nausea or vomiting, which make it difficult to work? Can you take your medicines or go for treatments early or late in the day, so the side effects won't interfere with the bulk of your workday? Will your side effects become more or less intense after a few weeks, which could affect your ability to concentrate on work as time passes? - Ask about treatments that might make it easier to continue working, including oral chemotherapies or treatments in clinical trials.\n\nIf you have a loved one who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, you may feel a little out of your element as you look into hospice care. One of the big questions on your mind may be, “What exactly does hospice do? What kind of services do they offer?” Today, we’ll take a look at the variety of standard offerings available through hospice and how they benefit your family. Before we get started, it’s always helpful to have a definition of hospice care. At its core, hospice care is about taking care of patients and their families with kindness and compassion. It focuses on creating a comfortable, pain-free environment for the terminally ill, making each person feel confident that they know what to expect, and offering supportive care to family members. First Things First\nOnce a terminally ill person enrolls in hospice care, they will begin receiving visits from their hospice care team. This team can include a wide variety of people, depending on the hospice services your family pursues. The team could include a nurse, hospice aide, social worker, chaplain, bereavement coordinator, physical, occupational, speech, or dietary therapists, spiritual and\/or grief counselors, and volunteers – all overseen by the hospice medical director. However, the services your family receives will depend on your specific needs. Adjustments are made to accommodate each individual patient and their family. So, if you don’t want or need a dietary therapist right now, you don’t have to have one. But if your needs change, you can always request a dietary therapist later. Hospice care is very personalized and can be tailored to fit a family’s specific needs over the duration of a person’s terminal illness. 7 Basic Hospice Services\nThe most common way to pay for hospice is with Medicare (85.4%), followed by private insurance (6.9%), Medicaid (5%), and other options, including self-pay (2.7%). Because Medicare is used most often to pay for hospice, its benefit rules are used by Medicaid and other insurance plans as a base line. In other words, other insurance companies base their hospice benefit plans on Medicare. That’s not to say there aren’t differences, but by reviewing Medicare’s hospice benefit policy, we can get a good look at what services are most commonly available across the country. NOTE: Some hospice providers will include their own personalized services in addition to these basic services, so make sure to ask if there are any additional services available. 1. Personal & Medical Care\nOf course, every hospice patient will receive medical care. However, it’s important to understand that this is not curative care. Instead, it’s focused on managing pain and symptoms so that a hospice patient’s final days are as comfortable as possible. This includes services from doctors and nurses as well as prescription medication. The hospice care team will closely monitor the hospice patient’s needs and create a treatment plan that meets both your end-of-life care preferences and provides optimal comfort. 2. Medical Supplies & Equipment\nSecondly, hospice will provide medical supplies and equipment that may be necessary for pain relief and symptom management. This could include a walker, wheelchair, oxygen tank, hospital bed, bandages, catheter, bedpan, wound care supplies, and much more. The hospice care team will arrange for both the delivery and removal of all such items. If there is something you need, communicate that to the care team, and they will work with you to ensure that the hospice patient’s needs are met. 3. Therapy & Nutrition\nWhile it may not come to mind at first, hospice will coordinate physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and even dietary counseling. If these services are deemed medically necessary by the hospice medical director, then they will be provided to the hospice patient. For example, if a person has trouble swallowing, speech therapy can help. As for nutritional care, as the hospice patient’s body begins the dying process, they may not be able to process as many calories, digest properly, or process food or drink at all. With dietary counseling, family members are given the information needed to know when and how to make adjustments to diet and ensure that a loved one’s food intake is correct. 4. Assistance at Home\nAs the hospice patient’s illness progresses, it will become even harder to take care of daily tasks.\n\n- Medicare provides coverage for many cystic fibrosis treatments and medications. - You can use Medicare Part A, Part B, and Part D together to get complete cystic fibrosis coverage. - You could also use a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription coverage to get at least the same coverage as parts A, B, and D in a single plan. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that currently affects more than 30,000 Americans, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. As recently as a few decades ago, most people with cystic fibrosis died during childhood. Today people with cystic fibrosis are living longer than ever. In fact, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, over half of all Americans with cystic fibrosis are adults. If you have cystic fibrosis and Medicare, you’re covered for a wide range of services. Medicare will cover the testing, treatments, and care you need to manage your cystic fibrosis. Each part of Medicare offers different coverage that can help you get the treatments and care you need for cystic fibrosis. It’s helpful to know which parts offer coverage for which services when you’re planning your care, especially when you’re managing a chronic condition. Items and services covered under each part include:\n- Medicare Part A. Part A is hospital insurance. It covers any inpatient care you need. This includes stays in the hospital and rehabilitation facilities, as well as limited home healthcare services. - Medicare Part B. Part B is medical insurance. It covers outpatient care such as the treatments you receive from your doctor. Part B also covers:\n- Medicare Part C. Part C is also called Medicare Advantage. It covers everything that parts A and B do and often includes coverage for additional services and prescription drug coverage. Medicare Advantage plans use networks to provide coverage, so you’ll often need to stay in network to get care when you use a Medicare Advantage plan. - Medicare Part D. Part D is prescription drug coverage. Medicare parts A and B, together known as original Medicare, don’t offer any prescription drug coverage unless you receive the medication during a hospital stay or doctor’s office visit. Stand-alone Medicare Part D plans can be added to original Medicare so that the prescriptions you take at home are covered. All Part D plans have a list, called a formulary, that tells you which prescription drugs are covered and how much they’ll cost. - Medigap. Medigap plans, also called Medicare supplement plans, cover some of the out-of-pocket costs of original Medicare. They don’t offer additional coverage, but they can allow you to receive medical care without worrying about out-of-pocket costs like deductibles or copayments. Now that we’ve looked at a general overview of what each part of Medicare covers, let’s look at how that applies to your healthcare needs when you have cystic fibrosis. Medicare will provide coverage for the visits, tests, treatments, and medications your doctor orders. However, different rules will apply for some covered services. Some of the services Medicare covers are listed below:\n- Testing and diagnosis. While cystic fibrosis is most often diagnosed during childhood, that’s not always the case. Some cystic fibrosis patients don’t know they have the condition until adulthood. You’ll have coverage for the testing you need under Medicare Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan. - Doctor’s and specialist’s visits. Medicare Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan will cover your doctor’s office visits and your visits to a specialist. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist if you’re using Medicare Part B, but you will need a referral with many Medicare Advantage plans. - Physical therapy. You can get physical therapy coverage through Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan. Medicare doesn’t limit the amount of physical therapy you can receive as long the therapy is deemed medically necessary by your doctor. - Respiratory care. Respiratory care, including the services of a respiratory therapist, is generally covered under Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan. However, if you receive respiratory care in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or as part of home healthcare service, it will be covered under Part A. - Pulmonary rehabilitation. Medicare Part B and Medicare Advantage cover outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.","passages":[{"passage":"Lifestyle diseases are ailments, which occur due to your way of living. These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:755f5b18-833c-48b3-a191-46baae9c64c7>"]},{"passage":"- Toddler Parenting Experts: Play-Based Learning Muna Bago Formal Schooling\n- Toddler Is 'No' Your Toddler's Favorite Word?

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited\/associated hospitals\/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost\/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9806b940-697d-46a2-8f9c-db3f030b69b6>"]},{"passage":"Being on workcover is a nightmare!

Here we share few tips that can help you survive WorkCover! Dealing with your injury- especially a permanent injury- and its after-effects can be extremely stressful. Negotiating your way around a very complex WorkCover system, dealing with your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors, so called “independent medical examiners” and even lawyers can be mind boggling and extremely stressful! Below are a few tips and tricks that can help you survive the WorkCover nightmare!Focus on your health and recovery\nYour highest priority should always be your health and to maximise your physical and\/or psychological recovery.WorkCover must pay for all reasonable treatment costs. We strongly believe that the most important issue is to ensure that you are getting the best quality medical treatment possible. Related blog articles\n- surviving workcover some more tips\n- workcover survival guide for injured workers\n- on being on workcover and what it’s like\nWhen you are seriously injured, you will have to make many important decisions about your future. To make the right decisions it will be critical to understand as much as you possibly can about the structure of WorkCover benefits, for example, how they interact with your other employment entitlements, and what all your entitlements really are. WorkCover is an extremely complex system! The Act of Parliament which governs WorkCover alone is several hundred pages long and quite complicated. Trying to understand just what WorkCover does and does not provide is really important. There are many resources available to help you with this task. The most detailed information, apart from the Act itself, is on the WorkSafe website which contains a very detailed publication called the ‘Online Claims Manual‘. This contains detailed instructions from WorkCover to its agents on how to handle claims. It also includes very detailed information about the calculation and payment of WorkCover benefits. Remember this information is written from WorkCover’s perspective only. Nonetheless this can be a useful resource for people who want detailed information.Try to deal as best you can with WorkCover\nDealing with WorkCover and -especially- your case manager can be extremely stressful.Following a few simple guidelines can make dealing with WorkCover, and your case manager (and rehab providers) a tad easier. - The most important thing is that you keep good, written records. For example, if you want to claim travel expenses you need to submit details of all your trips to and from doctors, incl train, bus, tram, taxi and parking receipts. If there is an argument about your weekly payments because WorkCover feel you are not looking for work, keeping a record of all your attempts to obtain work can put you in a far better position. - We advice all injured workers to only communicate\/correspond in writing, either via email or via letter\/fax. You do have the right to refuse telephone contact and you also have the right to request that all correspondence\/communications go through your legal representative, one of your doctors or an advocate. You can even put a “restraining” order on your harassing, bullying and\/or intimidating case manager (see our workcover tips collection for sample letters). - It’s also very important that you keep a copy of all your documents. For example, when you receive a certificate of incapacity, the original should be provided to your employer but ensure you make a copy for your own records. - Ask under the Freedom of Information Act or the Workers Compensation Act, for a copy of all your medical reports, including independent medical examination reports. - When submitting your medical certificates ensure that you complete the section on the back of the certificate about your work activities. If you don’t it will delay your payments and the form will be sent back to you. It may also be useful to try and ensure that your certificates expire on a Saturday or Sunday to make it easier for WorkCover or your employer to calculate your weekly entitlement. This enables weekly benefits to be paid in whole weeks. - Sometimes (well dare we say “often’) the decisions that a case manager makes can be extremely frustrating. Losing your cool can backfire as you will run the risk of being type cast as difficult or as suffering from a psychological problem!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bcd588fa-16a2-478c-8ee9-baad8ee759b6>"]},{"passage":"The Origins of Medicare\nBefore Medicare’s debut in 1966, millions of Americans were at risk of facing a major medical emergency without access to health insurance. When uninsured older Americans became ill, they only had a handful of options. They could empty their life savings, they could rely on help from friends and family, or they could suffer without proper care. All of that changed when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965 into law. Suddenly, there was a new option for millions of older Americans who couldn’t afford the high costs of health insurance or paying out-of-pocket. Over the past 55 years, Medicare has provided a lifeline to families across the United States, making healthcare more affordable, offering important end-of-life care, and even lowering the national poverty rate. But today’s Medicare is not identical to that which was signed into law in 1965. Most now feel confused when trying to have Medicare explained. It is very difficult to understand for those that are coming into Medicare for the first time. The past five decades have seen major changes and additions to the Medicare system. Today, Medicare is broken up into four major parts, signified by the letters A, B, C, and D.\nOriginal Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage\nFor anyone new to Medicare, it’s essential to understand each part and what it covers. But before we can look at each individual part, it’s important to recognize that Medicare is broken up into two larger categories: Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Medicare Parts A and B are known as Original Medicare because they function the way Medicare was originally setup, with the federal government paying health care costs directly. Medicare Parts C (also known as Medicare Advantage) and D involve private health insurance companies contracting with Medicare to provide benefits to customers. Instead of looking at the differences between these two approaches here, we’ll note them as we examine each individual part. There are a lot of pieces when having Medicare explained. So, let’s begin by looking at Medicare’s first program: Part A. It's Easier if I Explain it to You:\nMedicare Part A: Hospital & Hospice Insurance\nMedicare Part A covers emergency vehicle trips and hospital stays, including a hospital room, food, and any necessary testing. As of January 1, 2020, patients need to pay a $1,408 deductible at the beginning of their stay and Medicare will cover the next 60 days. After that, patients will be required to pay a copay of $335 per day for days 61 through 90. If a patient’s stay extends past the 90 day mark, they must tap into their ‘lifetime reserve days’, a set number of days they can use throughout their lifetime that require a $670 copayment. Besides hospital stays, Medicare Part A also covers rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility for 20 days. Patients can remain in a rehab facility for up to 80 days after this for a copayment of $167.50. This gives injured and ill older Americans the ability to get back on their feet and re-acclimated to normal life before heading home – without draining their life savings. Finally, Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care through a variety of hospice benefits. Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live can receive pain relief medication, symptom control prescriptions, and grief counseling. And Medicare Part A provides these benefits at no cost. The only end-of-life charges that someone with Medicare Part A may incur are outpatient drugs or respite care. To apply for premium-free Medicare Part A, someone must be 65 or older and paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. Those who haven’t paid Medicare taxes for that long (and don’t have a spouse who has either) can buy into the program at a reasonable cost. In addition, anyone who’s under 65 and has received Social Security disability benefits for two years or who is a kidney dialysis or transplant patient can receive Medicare Part A without paying premiums. Part A covers inpatient hospital expenses like surgeries. Part B covers outpatient medical expenses like doctor visits. What Does Medicare Part B Cover? Medicare Part B covers a variety of medical procedures not covered under Part A. Most of the things covered under Part B fall under outpatient procedures.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e32819ac-6a39-4cc8-a5ed-46449b9de4f2>"]},{"passage":"What You Need to Know About Insurance Parity\nShare Your Story\nShare your personal experiences with parity implementation.

This type of event can be extremely stressful as medical expenses and regular household bills will need to be paid, and it’s often hard to determine how long it could be until they’re well enough to work again. To support your loved one through this difficult time it’s a good idea to help them to put in place a plan to manage their finances. If money is needed to assist the person through this crisis, there are a few different options that can be considered:\n- Review the insurances they hold – if they have trauma cover or health insurance they may be able to claim back a number of expenses. - Check if they have KiwiSaver – they may be eligible for an early withdrawal from their savings due to their ill health and financial circumstances. - Ask them if they have any savings that could be used to help cover costs. - If your loved one doesn’t have any other means of income, and is too sick to work, they could look at applying for government assistance, see the Work and Income website for more information\nSupporting someone who is terminally illShow more\nIf someone you love becomes terminally ill, it’s important that they’re given the opportunity to make arrangements for their estate while they’re still able. This may include reviewing their:\n- life insurance policy - to ensure that loved ones are taken care of if something should happen\n- will - to ensure they’re comfortable with how their assets and savings will be divided up among their nominated beneficiaries. - funeral arrangements - if they choose they can make requests for how the funeral and burial should be carried out. Farewelling a loved oneShow more\nWhen a loved one passes away there are a number of arrangements you’ll need to make. Below are a list of steps you can follow to ensure you’re prepared:\n- Look for any instructions that your loved one may have left (including a funeral policy). - Arrange for a death certificate to be issued by a doctor, you’ll need this later on\n- Start making funeral plans; remember to consider guests that may have to travel a long way to attend. - Tell your friends, relatives and colleagues. The funeral director may be able to help with the death certificate, notifications, and give advice to help you deal with other details. If all this feels overwhelming, it’s a good idea to get help from a friend or family member so you can share the load. Planning for funeral costsShow more\nFuneral costs vary depending on the kind of service and funeral company you use. It’s a good idea to check for funeral preferences in the deceased’s will. Also, ask your funeral director for a detailed quote to understand costs up front. Here are some of the costs you need to consider when planning a funeral:\n- death certificate\n- funeral director fees\n- cemetery plot\n- other expenses, eg. celebrant, clergy, flowers, press notices, the wake. Private health, sickness, accident or life insurance policies may help to pay for funeral and other expenses. If the person who has died had personal insurance, call their insurance company to check what they are covered for in their policy. You may find that the person who has passed away has paid for their funeral in advance. If you think that the deceased may have prepaid their funeral expenses, but cannot find the paper work, talk to their solicitor, or the executor of their will. Settling propertyShow more\nMost people have a will drawn up to inform their loved ones how to divide up their money and possessions after their death. The executor of the will is responsible for distributing the person’s money and assets to those named in the will. People who are names in the will are known as 'beneficiaries'. Generally assets can only be distributed after debts are paid, and once the courts have granted 'probate' or validated the will. The executor will need a number of documents to enable them to administer the will. Try to gather these documents together as soon as possible:\n- banking records\n- credit, charge and store cards\n- taxation records\n- superannuation records\n- records of investments. If there is no will the estate is shared under a formula set by law.

But keep it flexible, because things will change. Start by making a list of everything you need to do -- breaking it up into small parts can make things less daunting -- and then prioritizing. And don't forget the cardinal rule of management: Delegate whenever possible. Know the Facts About Your Diagnosis and Treatment\nBefore you approach colleagues, talk to your doctor specifically about the ways that your illness can affect your career. Here are a few helpful tips to smooth the process:\n- Tell your doctor exactly what your job entails and any unique circumstances you'll be coping with. - If work is a priority, let your doctor know that it's important for you to make decisions that will benefit your health and your job whenever possible. - Ask for general ideas about the ways that your diagnosis, medication or treatment could affect your job performance. - Find out specific details about all of your medications and treatments, including common side effects. How can you manage side effects like nausea or vomiting, which make it difficult to work? Can you take your medicines or go for treatments early or late in the day, so the side effects won't interfere with the bulk of your workday? Will your side effects become more or less intense after a few weeks, which could affect your ability to concentrate on work as time passes? - Ask about treatments that might make it easier to continue working, including oral chemotherapies or treatments in clinical trials.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8e1c21f2-d7c9-4d6d-816e-b67e6d5abc6c>"]},{"passage":"If you have a loved one who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, you may feel a little out of your element as you look into hospice care. One of the big questions on your mind may be, “What exactly does hospice do? What kind of services do they offer?” Today, we’ll take a look at the variety of standard offerings available through hospice and how they benefit your family. Before we get started, it’s always helpful to have a definition of hospice care. At its core, hospice care is about taking care of patients and their families with kindness and compassion. It focuses on creating a comfortable, pain-free environment for the terminally ill, making each person feel confident that they know what to expect, and offering supportive care to family members. First Things First\nOnce a terminally ill person enrolls in hospice care, they will begin receiving visits from their hospice care team. This team can include a wide variety of people, depending on the hospice services your family pursues. The team could include a nurse, hospice aide, social worker, chaplain, bereavement coordinator, physical, occupational, speech, or dietary therapists, spiritual and\/or grief counselors, and volunteers – all overseen by the hospice medical director. However, the services your family receives will depend on your specific needs. Adjustments are made to accommodate each individual patient and their family. So, if you don’t want or need a dietary therapist right now, you don’t have to have one. But if your needs change, you can always request a dietary therapist later. Hospice care is very personalized and can be tailored to fit a family’s specific needs over the duration of a person’s terminal illness. 7 Basic Hospice Services\nThe most common way to pay for hospice is with Medicare (85.4%), followed by private insurance (6.9%), Medicaid (5%), and other options, including self-pay (2.7%). Because Medicare is used most often to pay for hospice, its benefit rules are used by Medicaid and other insurance plans as a base line. In other words, other insurance companies base their hospice benefit plans on Medicare. That’s not to say there aren’t differences, but by reviewing Medicare’s hospice benefit policy, we can get a good look at what services are most commonly available across the country. NOTE: Some hospice providers will include their own personalized services in addition to these basic services, so make sure to ask if there are any additional services available. 1. Personal & Medical Care\nOf course, every hospice patient will receive medical care. However, it’s important to understand that this is not curative care. Instead, it’s focused on managing pain and symptoms so that a hospice patient’s final days are as comfortable as possible. This includes services from doctors and nurses as well as prescription medication. The hospice care team will closely monitor the hospice patient’s needs and create a treatment plan that meets both your end-of-life care preferences and provides optimal comfort. 2. Medical Supplies & Equipment\nSecondly, hospice will provide medical supplies and equipment that may be necessary for pain relief and symptom management. This could include a walker, wheelchair, oxygen tank, hospital bed, bandages, catheter, bedpan, wound care supplies, and much more. The hospice care team will arrange for both the delivery and removal of all such items. If there is something you need, communicate that to the care team, and they will work with you to ensure that the hospice patient’s needs are met. 3. Therapy & Nutrition\nWhile it may not come to mind at first, hospice will coordinate physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and even dietary counseling. If these services are deemed medically necessary by the hospice medical director, then they will be provided to the hospice patient. For example, if a person has trouble swallowing, speech therapy can help. As for nutritional care, as the hospice patient’s body begins the dying process, they may not be able to process as many calories, digest properly, or process food or drink at all. With dietary counseling, family members are given the information needed to know when and how to make adjustments to diet and ensure that a loved one’s food intake is correct. 4. Assistance at Home\nAs the hospice patient’s illness progresses, it will become even harder to take care of daily tasks.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e9bb7a7f-1eed-44ad-9bef-7dbefda3a1a3>"]},{"passage":"- Medicare provides coverage for many cystic fibrosis treatments and medications. - You can use Medicare Part A, Part B, and Part D together to get complete cystic fibrosis coverage. - You could also use a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription coverage to get at least the same coverage as parts A, B, and D in a single plan. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that currently affects more than 30,000 Americans, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. As recently as a few decades ago, most people with cystic fibrosis died during childhood. Today people with cystic fibrosis are living longer than ever. In fact, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, over half of all Americans with cystic fibrosis are adults. If you have cystic fibrosis and Medicare, you’re covered for a wide range of services. Medicare will cover the testing, treatments, and care you need to manage your cystic fibrosis. Each part of Medicare offers different coverage that can help you get the treatments and care you need for cystic fibrosis. It’s helpful to know which parts offer coverage for which services when you’re planning your care, especially when you’re managing a chronic condition. Items and services covered under each part include:\n- Medicare Part A. Part A is hospital insurance. It covers any inpatient care you need. This includes stays in the hospital and rehabilitation facilities, as well as limited home healthcare services. - Medicare Part B. Part B is medical insurance. It covers outpatient care such as the treatments you receive from your doctor. Part B also covers:\n- Medicare Part C. Part C is also called Medicare Advantage. It covers everything that parts A and B do and often includes coverage for additional services and prescription drug coverage. Medicare Advantage plans use networks to provide coverage, so you’ll often need to stay in network to get care when you use a Medicare Advantage plan. - Medicare Part D. Part D is prescription drug coverage. Medicare parts A and B, together known as original Medicare, don’t offer any prescription drug coverage unless you receive the medication during a hospital stay or doctor’s office visit. Stand-alone Medicare Part D plans can be added to original Medicare so that the prescriptions you take at home are covered. All Part D plans have a list, called a formulary, that tells you which prescription drugs are covered and how much they’ll cost. - Medigap. Medigap plans, also called Medicare supplement plans, cover some of the out-of-pocket costs of original Medicare. They don’t offer additional coverage, but they can allow you to receive medical care without worrying about out-of-pocket costs like deductibles or copayments. Now that we’ve looked at a general overview of what each part of Medicare covers, let’s look at how that applies to your healthcare needs when you have cystic fibrosis. Medicare will provide coverage for the visits, tests, treatments, and medications your doctor orders. However, different rules will apply for some covered services. Some of the services Medicare covers are listed below:\n- Testing and diagnosis. While cystic fibrosis is most often diagnosed during childhood, that’s not always the case. Some cystic fibrosis patients don’t know they have the condition until adulthood. You’ll have coverage for the testing you need under Medicare Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan. - Doctor’s and specialist’s visits. Medicare Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan will cover your doctor’s office visits and your visits to a specialist. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist if you’re using Medicare Part B, but you will need a referral with many Medicare Advantage plans. - Physical therapy. You can get physical therapy coverage through Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan. Medicare doesn’t limit the amount of physical therapy you can receive as long the therapy is deemed medically necessary by your doctor. - Respiratory care. Respiratory care, including the services of a respiratory therapist, is generally covered under Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan. However, if you receive respiratory care in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or as part of home healthcare service, it will be covered under Part A. - Pulmonary rehabilitation. Medicare Part B and Medicare Advantage cover outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5df84b0a-b1c3-42e7-8b23-2804297b0481>"]}]}
