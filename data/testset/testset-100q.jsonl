It is unclear whether there is a modest elevated risk for shorter durations of night shift work.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:0d5afd90-8df2-42bc-b1e3-7cb7d736c23a>']","texts":"['Breast Cancer and Night work\\nMelatonin, sleep disturbance and cancer risk.\\nLaboratory of Chrono-Neuroendocrine Oncology, Department of Structural and Cellular Biology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. firstname.lastname@example.org\\nThe pineal hormone melatonin is involved in the circadian regulation and facilitation of sleep, the inhibition of cancer development and growth, and the enhancement of immune function. Individuals, such as night shift workers, who are exposed to light at night on a regular basis experience biological rhythm (i.e., circadian) disruption including circadian phase shifts, nocturnal melatonin suppression, and sleep disturbances. Additionally, these individuals are not only immune suppressed, but they are also at an increased risk of developing a number of different types of cancer. There is a reciprocal interaction and regulation between sleep and the immune system quite independent of melatonin. Sleep disturbances can lead to immune suppression and a shift to the predominance in cancer-stimulatory cytokines. Some studies suggest that a shortened duration of nocturnal sleep is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer development. The relative individual contributions of sleep disturbance, circadian disruption due to light at night exposure, and related impairments of melatonin production and immune function to the initiation and promotion of cancer in high-risk individuals such as night shift workers are unknown. The mutual reinforcement of interacting circadian rhythms of melatonin production, the sleep\/wake cycle and immune function may indicate a new role for undisturbed, high quality sleep, and perhaps even more importantly, uninterrupted darkness, as a previously unappreciated endogenous mechanism of cancer prevention.\\nWork at night and breast cancer \u2013 report on evidence-based options for preventive actions.\\nDepartment of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Bispebjerg University Hospital, Bispebjerg Bakke 23, DK-2400 Copenhagen NV, Denmark. email@example.com.\\nIn 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified shift work involving circadian disruption as probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2A), primarily based on experimental and epidemiologic evidence for breast cancer. In order to examine options for evidence-based preventive actions, 16 researchers in basic, epidemiological and applied sciences convened at a workshop in Copenhagen 26-27 October 2011. This paper summarizes the evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies and presents possible recommendations for prevention of the effects of night work on breast cancer. Among those studies that quantified duration of shift work, there were statistically significant elevations in risk only after about 20 years working night shift. It is unclear from these studies whether or not there is a modest but real elevated risk for shorter durations. Hence, restriction of the total number of years working night shift could be one future preventive recommendation for shift workers. The diurnal secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland with peak in secretory activity during the night is a good biochemical marker of the circadian rhythm. Disruption of the diurnal melatonin secretion pattern can be diminished by restricting the number of consecutive night shifts. Reddish light and reduced light intensity during work at night could potentially help diminish the inhibitory activity of light with strong intensity on the melatonin secretion, but further mechanistic insight is needed before definite recommendations can be made. Earlier or more intensive mammography screening among female night shift worker is not recommended because the harm-benefit ratio in this age group may not be beneficial. Preventive effects of melatonin supplementation on breast cancer risk have not been clearly documented, but may be a promising avenue if a lack of side effects can be shown even after long-term ingestion. Women with previous or current breast cancer should be advised not to work night shifts because of strong experimental evidence demonstrating accelerated tumor growth by suppression of melatonin secretion. Work during the night is widespread worldwide. To provide additional evidence-based recommendations on prevention of diseases related to night shift work, large studies on the impact of various shift schedules and type of light on circadian rhythms need to be conducted in real work environments.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":834,"question":"why battery energy storage becoming more attractive in markets with high pv penetration","gold":"Energy storage is becoming more attractive in markets with high PV penetration due to regulatory compliance requirements. In areas like Hawaii with heavy PV penetration on certain feeders, intermittency of PV during weather events has made energy storage necessary. Some utility markets like Puerto Rico are using energy storage to smooth power delivery. Similarly, Europe is incentivizing 'self-consumption' by using modest battery banks and smart-load monitoring to increase locally-used PV energy and minimize grid fluctuations.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:e78a1fdc-c588-4543-8f80-bc8f8fe23129>']","texts":"['Solar Energy Storage: Page 6 of 14\\nInside this Article\\nOff-grid system designers have significant experience working with low- and medium-capacity...\\nBefore the advent of modern maximum power point tracking (MPPT) photovoltaic controllers,...\\nWe introduce electricians and integrators who are new to batterybased grid-tied PV installations to...\\nWhat markets and applications provide an optimal value proposition for PV systems with integrated storage?\\nStorage plays a role in many markets, but is most commonly applied in the residential and commercial space where it is most cost effective. In a general sense, that is any place where the cost of energy exceeds the life cycle cost of a PV and battery system. Historically, this meant off-grid or remote microgrids where the cost of transmission made PV and batteries the least expensive option. However, decreasing PV costs over the last several years opened new applications, with PV and batteries merging with diesel grids. Now the hurdle is battery costs. There are various battery technologies that are driving life cycles up and capital costs down, achieving better LCOE [levelized cost of energy]. Those are the macro market drivers.\\nOther ancillary attributes make energy storage worth considering regardless of least-cost economics, the biggest of which is backup power. In the residential market, it doesn\u2019t matter if the grid is cheaper when the grid has failed, because backup power is about security, not economic payback. Economics are more of a concern in commercial applications. One exciting application in the commercial space utilizes energy storage to reduce peak-demand charges. Loads are monitored and, when a customer is near a penalty threshold, stored energy is pushed into the load center, keeping the customer under the penalty.\\nAreas of regulatory compliance, such as markets with heavy PV penetration on certain feeders as in Hawaii, are making energy storage attractive. Due to the intermittency of PV during weather events, some utility markets such as Puerto Rico are using energy storage to smooth power delivery. Europe is incentivizing the concept of \u201cself-consumption,\u201d utilizing modest battery banks and smart-load monitoring to increase the percentage of PV energy used locally, minimizing impact and fluctuations on the grid.\\nDo you have any insights on the status of the solar energy storage market in Germany?\\nGermany has incentivized storage as a way to increase renewable energy penetration. The primary driver in the German market isn\u2019t security from storms, it\u2019s pure economics. The German policy model has created a system where consumption of PV power generated on-site is financially more advantageous than selling the power back to the grid. This focus on home energy management utilizes storage to time shift consumption to times when it\u2019s most economically viable for the consumer and most beneficial for the grid operator.\\nHow are recent challenges to state net metering laws impacting the growth trajectory of solar storage?\\nNet metering has been a pillar of support for the US PV industry. It\u2019s been critical to the growth of the grid-tied market. Should it go away or new policies affect its economics, on-site storage could become an alternative much in the way Germany\u2019s market operates. In a paradoxical way, any erosion of net metering is good for the storage market. Any increase in cost or hassle makes the relative cost of adding storage seem more palatable.\\nHow will California\u2019s Assembly Bill 2514 impact the deployment of solar storage systems in the state?\\nThe mandate of storage will obviously impact both the consumer and utility sides, as outlined within the bill. We have noticed that this bill has already accelerated deployment of solar storage systems. By establishing guidelines and securing a potential market, it allows investment in the segment, spurring technological advances and leading to real volumes.\\nWhat are the major obstacles to the rapid expansion of the sales and deployment of solar storage systems in the US?\\nCertainly, the industry must address the cost of batteries and associated maintenance concerns, through either policy support or financial mechanisms like PPAs or leases. Likewise, the industry needs to work with grid operators so utilities benefit from the application of storage technologies, whether they are residential, commercial or utility scale. Advancements in the integration of grid, loads and renewable energy control systems are necessary. Finally, most installers are still inexperienced in storage technologies and are reluctant to sell into that space.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"causal","error":null,"n":1}

Then in June and August, they destroyed synagogues in Munich and Nuremberg.

These events directly prompted Chagall to create the White Crucifixion as a response to depict the martyrdom of Jesus as a symbol for religious persecution.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:a20c283f-8219-4780-8faf-5eb68ed90619>']","texts":"['Sermon - 21st August 2011\\nSeeing Salvation: 10\\nWhite Crucifixion - Marc Chagall\\nScripture - Colossians 1:15-29\\nRev Andy Braunston\\nThe Painting - Discussion\\nLook at the painting, either on the sheets you have or on the screen.

Is it like other images of the crucifixion?\\nNo \u2013 Jesus wears a Jewish prayer shawl. No \u2013 in other examples of a crucifixion Jesus is the central figure who suffers and others gaze on his suffering. Sometimes the suffering of Mary watching her son die is portrayed. But in this all are suffering, Jesus is one more Jew who is being persecuted.\\nChagall was born and grew up in Tsarist Russia. As a Jew he was only allowed to be educated to primary level but his mother bribed the local school official to let him attend secondary school. He studied art during the Revolution and is most famous for his portrayals of Jewish life in pre-revolutionary Russia. By the 1930s he had moved to France \u2013 indeed he was in France when the Germans invaded and had to rely on the generosity of the American counsel in Marseille to get him, and his wife, out to safety.\\nWhite Crucifixion was painted in 1938 and has a specific context. Chagall painted it to draw attention to a recent series of political events perpetrated by the ruling Nazis in Germany. Both as a Jew and as an abstract artist Chagall was a target of Hitler\\'s art censorship policies. His dealer in Germany was forced to close his Berlin gallery, cease publication of its influential newsletter, and flee to the Soviet Union in 1932. In 1937, the Nazis undertook a systematic inventory of modern art in German museums, removing some 16,000 works unacceptable to their taste to use in propaganda campaigns, to destroy, or to sell outside the country. Four works by Chagall were among those included in the \\'Jewish\\' room of the infamous \\'Degenerate Art\\' exhibition staged in Munich at the end of 1937, which mocked deviations from Nazi Party art standards.\\nMeanwhile, anti-Jewish policies in Germany escalated to an unthinkable level. Following the September 1935 laws to curtail the civil rights of Jews, the Nazis, in 1938, undertook a Jewish census and registered all Jewish businesses as preliminaries to plans for ethnic genocide. In June and August of that year the synagogues in Munich and Nuremberg were destroyed, and on November 9, the so-called Crystal Night took place where Jewish shops and businesses were attacked. The name \u201cCrystal Night\u201d comes from the amount of glass that was shattered from all those shop windows.\\nIn reaction, Chagall conceived a painting of the martyrdom of the Jesus, the Jew, as a universal symbol for religious persecution. Instead of a crown of thorns, the Jesus on Chagall\\'s picture wears a head-cloth and a prayer shawl around his loins. The round halo around his head is repeated by the round glow around the Menorah at his feet. Mourning his persecution, figures of the Hebrew patriarchs and the matriarch Rachel appear in the smoke-filled night sky \u2013 but some of these can\u2019t bear to look.\\nAll around the cross, Chagall has depicted a bleak snow scape with horrific scenes of contemporary Germany. In the background to the right, a soldier opens the doors of a flaming Torah ark removed from a pillaged synagogue, the contents of which litter the foreground. Both the flag above the synagogue and the soldier\\'s armband originally were decorated with swastikas. One of the fleeing figures in the foreground at the left wears a sign which originally bore the inscription \"Ich bin Jude\" (\\'I am a Jew\\') but Chagall painted over these before fleeing France. In the background above is a ship full of refugees trying ineffectively to flee a burning village, destroyed before the arrival of a liberating People\\'s Army from the Soviet Union carrying red flags; this last detail was wishful thinking, motivated by the antagonism of Stalin\\'s government toward Hitler\\'s before 1939.\\nIncluded in an exhibition of Chagall\\'s works in Paris in early 1940, the \"White Crucifixion\" was designed to raise awareness of the events in Hitler\\'s Germany and their implications for humanity in general.\\nSo this is a painting about suffering, and, in particular, the suffering of the Jewish people. Perhaps a contemporary artist might paint an Iranian Jesus surrounded by scenes of the repression of Iranian gay people, those who advocate democracy and women who work for equal rights there. Or perhaps there might be a Zimbabwean Jesus surrounded by symbols of the ruthless oppression of Mugabe.\\nChagall as a Jew understands the universal nature of Jesus\u2019 suffering and sees the persecution of God\u2019s people as being an attack on God\u2019s own self. For me it\u2019s an illustration of Jesus\u2019 words recorded in St Matthew where he says that however we treat the \u201cleast\u201d of his sisters and brothers is a reflection on how we are actually treating him.\\nOur reading continues this theme of suffering, and the suffering of Jesus. Paul sees his vocation as a Christian, and as a Christian leader, as entering into and sharing the sufferings of Jesus. To be a Christian is to participate in those sufferings. Paul seems to understand that those sufferings didn\u2019t end on the cross but that the sufferings of Christ continue in his people.\\nThe history of the Church has always included persecution and includes it now in lands where to be Christian is illegal. We have had victimisation, persecution and murder in MCC, particularly in our early years.\\nChagall in his painting shows that the suffering of Jesus is also seen in the Jewish people, or perhaps he shows that the suffering of the Jewish people is also seen in Jesus.\\nI\u2019m always suspicious of the type of Christianity that implies that everything will be ok once we\u2019re Christian, that implies there will be no more pain and that sees God as a kind of cosmic insurance policy. The witness of Scripture is that God is with us in our sufferings, that the way we treat others reflects how we treat Jesus and that God has an especial concern for the poor, the dispossessed and the persecuted.\\nChagall, used his art to bring to the attention of the art world the despotic persecution of the Jews in Germany \u2013 1938 was before the death camps but was an era of legal restriction, social alienation and state-sponsored persecution. In general the Western democracies didn\u2019t intervene, didn\u2019t allow many Jews to emigrate and worried about the effect of mass immigration if they did open their borders.\\nSuffering still continues, Christ still suffers in his people. Part of our role and ministry as Christians is to draw attention to injustice and suffering \u2013 just as we do when we sign and ask others to sign petitions against the deportation of gay people to Uganda just as we did this week \u2013 and the petition work, the man in question has been allowed to submit new evidence to the Home Office. But we are also called to fight injustice, to protest against the misuse of power and to try and help heal the wounds of those who have been damaged.\\nWe stand alongside those in need, those who are suffering \u2013 mentally, physically, those who suffer because of the actions of others as well as those who suffer because of their own actions. We stand alongside them and recognise the suffering of Jesus in the suffering of His people.\\nChagall hoped, in his picture, that the Red Army would end the suffering of the Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Sadly he was wrong. We may hope in earthly powers and governments to make a difference \u2013 indeed we should lobby and vote for politicians who will make such a difference. But we also, as Christians, know that the final deliverance from suffering will not be seen this side of the grave. Jesus suffers on the cross with his people, and with Jesus we await the final day of resurrection.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"procedural","error":null,"n":1}

Heat, cold, dust, moisture, vibration, explosion sensitivity and corrosion; there are many circumstances in which classic switching equipment does not (or can not) function. Steute switchgear has been developed for such applications, which are durable, even against extreme conditions. The name of the range says it all: \"Extreme\". The \"Extreme\" range includes switchgear with unique features, such as:\\n- Sealing degree\\n- ATEX zones\\n- Resistant to shock and vibration\\nSafe switching equipment\\nSteute develops and produces switchgear and is a specialist in the field of safe switching applications. Steute has a solution for every switching application. Often these are standard solutions, but if there is no standard solution, then a custom-made product is possible.\\nThe following switches belong to the \"Extreme\" range:\\n- Foot switches\\n- Position switches\\n- Pull-wire switches\\n- Magnetic sensors\\n- Safety switches\\n- Inductive sensors\\n- Wireless products\\nDegree of protection - Sealing degree\\nThe IP (Ingress Protection) rating system is an internationally recognized scale with regard to protection against environmental factors such as liquids and solids. The IP value is followed by 2 digits. These numbers determine the value of the protection. The first number refers to the amount of protection against solids, such as dust particles, while the second number refers to the protection against liquids. The larger the number, the greater the protection. The highest protection is IP69K.\\nWhat is IP69K?\\nThe IP69K classification provides protection against the ingress of dust and water products under high temperature and under high pressure. The IP69K classification is ideal for use of equipment in conditions where the equipment has to be cleaned carefully.\\nIn industries such as food processing, where hygiene and cleanliness are of the utmost importance, the equipment must be able to withstand stringent high-pressure cleaning procedures at high temperatures. In many industries, where dust and dirt can be a problem, it is important to ensure that dust can not penetrate a product\\'s casing and cause it to malfunction. Steute has many switchgear that are unique due to the high degree of protection of IP69K.\\nAchieve IP69K and its benefits\\nIn environments where heavy cleaning procedures are required, such as in food processing industries, the combination of water, chemicals, high pressures and temperatures can be fatal to electronic equipment. The products with an IP69K rating undergo a challenging series of tests to ensure that they offer protection against water and dust penetration under high pressure and temperatures.\\nThe housing of switchgear plays an important role in durability and resistance to environmental factors. In the applications of equipment in ports and at sea, a lot of damage is caused by corrosion of materials. The failure of equipment due to corrosion in offshore can have major (financial) consequences. Aluminum is highly corrosion-resistant and is widely used on equipment in offshore applications. Aluminum protects itself with its layer of oxide, unlike many other metals.\\nGlass fiber reinforced thermoplastic (PA66)\\nAluminum does not offer the solution in every application. Fiberglass-reinforced thermoplastic (PA66) has a number of advantages over aluminum. PA66 has a lower density, has better chemical resistance, lower wear and friction, is firmer and has less production costs. Do you need a switch in an application that is frequently cleaned with chemical cleaning agents? Then PA66 or another plastic is preferred. A plastic housing reinforced with glass fiber is resistant to vibrations and impacts.\\nUL stands for Underwriters Laboratories. UL writes safety standards covering almost anything that is conceivable, and grants approvals for products that meet the requirements of a particular standard according to their audit and counter tests. UL94 is a standard established by UL for testing the flammability of plastics. For UL94-V0, there are many different tests within UL94, including vertical, horizontal and 45 \u00b0 flame tests, all of which have different rating designations. The V0 is the hardest to reach and is what most customers need.\\nTemperatures -60\u00b0C up to +180\u00b0C\\nThe above blocks describe a number of factors that have a major influence on the temperature resistance of switching equipment and switching components, for example the housing.\\nAluminum vs. plastic\\nAn aluminum housing is resistant to high temperatures (+ 180 \u00b0C), but at temperatures of -60 \u00b0C a plastic (glass fiber reinforced impact-resistant thermoplastic PA66) is preferred. The switchgear from steute has a temperature range from -60 \u00b0C to +180 \u00b0C.\\nATEX stands for all situations where there is a risk of gas or dust explosion. The abbreviation ATEX comes from the French words ATmosphere EXplosible from the European directives of explosion safety.\\nCompanies that work in environments where there is a risk of explosion must take measures to ensure the safety of the employees to carry out their work. Guidelines have been drawn up for this. Switchgear that is used in environments where there is a risk of explosion must meet specific requirements.\\nThe housing and sealing degree play an important role for the application of switchgear in ATEX zones.

{"id":584,"question":"I'm a railway infrastructure engineer working on a new high-speed line project. How do you properly design track curves to ensure smooth passenger train operation while minimizing rail wear?","gold":"To properly design track curves for high-speed trains, you need to focus on three key elements: 1) Determine the minimum radius of curves based on the desired line-speed, 2) Apply the correct 'cant' (or 'cross level' in US terminology) by elevating the outer rail above the inner rail, 3) Balance the centripetal force pushing the train outwards with the gravitational force pulling inwards at normal transit speeds. When this balance is achieved, you'll get both a smooth ride for passengers and minimal wear on rails and train wheelsets.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:7d4027a6-a1bd-451f-9dd4-7b6d51c7bd71>']","texts":"['The most significant difference between high speed passenger trains and freight services is \u2013 of course \u2013 speed. When passenger and freight services wish to share the same tracks, you have to consider both the technical aspects and the capacity issues.\\nWhen designing a new high-speed line, the minimum radius of the curves will be determined by the desired line-speed. In order to minimise rail wear, and provide a smooth and comfortable ride for the passengers, the outer rail of the pair of tracks is usually elevated above the level of the inside rail. This is known as \u201ccant\u201d, and in Europe it is usually measured in degrees, i.e. the angle of elevation of one rail above the other. In US terminology, \u201ccant\u201d is known as \u201ccross level\u201d and it is measured as a height difference, rather than an angle.\\nPut simply, the theoretical aim is to achieve a balance between the centripetal force of the train being pushed outwards around the curve, and the gravitational force pulling it inwards, at the speed at which the passenger train will normally transit that section of track. If the track designer achieves this, then the train ride will be smooth, and the wear on both the rails and the wheelsets of the train will be minimized.\\nIt gets much more complicated if you add freight trains into the equation. Whereas the passenger train might be travelling at 300 kph or more, the freight train is likely to be travelling at 120 kph or even less. So when the freight train tries to go around this curve, the wheel flanges will be continually grinding at the lower rail head, as the gravitational force pulling the train downwards greatly exceeds the centripetal force, because of the lower speed. The result is significant rail wear, and the need to inspect and replace rails much more frequently.\\nAnother technical issue is the design of the trackbed drainage. When building a new line, it is necessary to consider the consequences of any derailment which might release hazardous goods into the environment. So the drainage of the line has to include catch ponds to prevent any such spillage from entering the public drainage system. However if you design for passenger trains only, the issue of dangerous goods does not arise, so this element of the infrastructure design can removed from the plans.\\nWhen designing a line purely for high speed passenger trains, you can use steeper gradients because of the excellent power:weight ratio of the rolling stock. Gradients as steep as 3.5% can be used. This is too steep for heavy freight services, particularly if they are to run at sensible speeds (both for commercial and operational reasons). If the line is passenger only it can be designed to follow the contours of the countryside more closely, whereas a line designed for freight will require shallower gradients, and therefore higher bridges and deeper cuttings.\\nThe big difference in speed between a high speed passenger train and a freight train means that trying to run both together on the same line at the same time consumes a huge amount of capacity. With a modern signalling system such as ETCS Level 2, you can run successive trains at intervals as low as 3 minutes, even at speeds in excess of 300 kph. Imagine you have a freight train in a siding, waiting to join the main line, with the next place it can be looped being some 50 km distant. A non-stop passenger train will cover that distance in just 10 minutes, whereas the freight train will take 45 minutes or more, maybe over an hour depending upon the weight, maximum speed, and type of locomotive. So to run a freight train you would need a gap of at least 40 minutes in the passenger service \u2013 maybe more. With the signalling enabling a path every 3 minutes, that means in this example 1 freight path equals 13 passenger paths! Would the freight operator pay for 13 passenger train paths in order to move his train? I don\u2019t expect so!\\nYou can overcome this to some extent by changing the use of the route according to time of day. For example, in Germany the Hannover to W\u00fcrzburg line is used for passenger services between 05:30 and 23:00, and freight services overnight. Similarly in England the line from the Channel Tunnel to London is used by some freight services overnight, when no Eurostar international passenger trains or \u201cJavelin\u201d domestic express passenger trains are running.\\nOne other option to consider is moving high value parcels traffic in specially-adapted high speed trains. In France, SNCF do this with their \u201cTGV Postale\u201d sets, which move letters and parcels traffic between Paris and Lyon at speeds which match the passenger services. Of course this requires investment in specialist equipment and rolling stock, but it does neatly overcome the issue of trying to obtain capacity for this specific type of freight during the hours of daytime passenger train operation.\\nSo it is possible to run both freight and passenger on a high speed line? Yes, provided the line is specifically designed to accept them both from the outset, and provided the capacity can be split in such a way that the two different types of train have minimal interaction. However, running freight on a high speed line involves a significant number of compromises, some with big price tags attached, so it is not to be considered as a \u201cfree gift\u201d.\\nCategories: Railway Infrastructure']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"procedural","error":null,"n":1}

It is named for the Queen as \\'el Palau de les Arts Reina Sof\u00eda\\'. The opera house was designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava who was actually born in Valencia.\\nFor Calatrava, the completion of the opera house is the culmination of 14 years\\' work. The architect commented \"Because of the time spent, its size and because it involves music, this project is the most intense and the one I\\'ve devoted most time on, so far. It represents a correlation between spectator, musician and artist\".\\nThe actual building is a masterpiece of modern architecture and descriptions of it have varied from \\'a blend of seagoing vessel and spacecraft\\' to \\'some sort of prehistoric trilobite\\' or a \\'giant warrior\\'s helmet\\'.\\nWhatever the perception of the building there is no doubt it will become a symbol of the city of Valencia just as the Sydney opera house in Australia has.\\nIn the past Valencia \u2013 Spain\\'s third-largest city \u2013 has lagged behind Madrid and Barcelona for art and architecture, but the new Palace of Arts will certainly give the Guggenheim in Bilbao a run for its money. The building cost an estimated \u20ac120m to construct.\\nVALENCIA OPERA HOUSE INTERIOR\\nThe opera house is actually part of a larger complex mostly designed by the same architect (Santiago Calatrava) called the City of Arts and Sciences (la Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies), a \u20ac400m complex, constructed on the old dried-up Turia riverbed featuring a planetarium and a science museum.\\nThe Palau de les Arts Reina Sof\u00eda has three different halls: including a main performance space (1,800 seats) that can act as a symphony orchestra concert hall or a ballet and theatre stage as well as opera venue. Another of the halls, the \\'Aula Magistral\\' (master class room), has a capacity of 400 spectators and is designed for conferences, lectures, roundtables and children\\'s theatre.\\nThe Upper Auditorium (amphitheatre) has a capacity for more than 1,700 and can host special musical events with optical effects, artistic videos and pop music. The building is capable of seating up to 4,000 people in three different halls (three events can occur simultaneously).\\nVALENCIA OPERA HOUSE DESIGN\\nThe setting of the building is all important, as it stands in over 87,000m\u00b2 of gardens with 10,000m\u00b2 of reflecting pools and interlinked surrounding paths. The building itself is over 70m in height and has a total floor area of around 40,000m\u00b2.\\nThe roof or \\'feather plume\\' is the most structurally spectacular detail, 230m in length and consisting of two \\'shells\\' which embrace the building on the outside. These are constructed of laminated steel with an approximate weight of 3,000t and feature delicate mosaic ceramic work (trencad\u00eds) on the outside, which along with the white concrete gives the outer surface of the building a daytime and night time luminosity. The roof is held up by two supports, one at its western end and the other in the midsection, with the eastern end of the roof totally projecting.\\nThe building, taking into account the curved shapes which give it its lenticular form, is 163m in length by 87m wide. It was designed with the dual intention of acting as a multi-hall auditorium and creating a striking urban landmark for the city.\\nThe opera house resembles a ship with round portals, or the cracked shell of an egg in which the main auditorium itself is the yolk.\\nThe most eye catching features are two narrow sheaths that seem to billow atop the oval base like an abstract feather or ribbon blown upward by the wind. Calatrava\\'s innovative design will also allow spectators to watch rehearsals through glass panels and enjoy the view from the boat-like opera house\\'s \\'decks.\\' The nautical theme ties in very well with the siting of the building in the Turia riverbed and its closeness to the ocean.\\nThe developer of the building was Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias S.A. The construction contractors were Dragados and Necso and the stage engineering was the responsibility of Waagner-Biro B\u00fchnentechnik AG. The acoustics were the remit of Alfonso Garc\u00eda (Garc\u00eda B.B.M. S.L.).\\nThe construction required over 77,000m\u00b3 of concrete, 275,000m\u00b3 of earth movement, 1,750 linear meters of piles, 38,500m\u00b2 of granite, 20,000m\u00b2 of \\'trencad\u00eds\\' (fractured ceramic tile mosaic), 3,360m\u00b2 of glass, 20,000,000kg of structural corrugated steel and 10,000,000kg of structural steel. There are also 1,450 doors in the building.\\nBUILDING SPACES IN DETAIL\\nThe Main Hall (seating 1,800) is the core around which the building generates both its formal and structural aspects. It is located within the structural support of the building created by curved surfaces and interior boxes of white concrete.\\nThe meeting foyer lies around the main hall providing a perimeter route to access the rooms beside the hall; spiral ramp staircases mean that there are exits from the hall at different heights. The longitudinal section is generated through the sight lines of the audience towards the stage and the opera boxes are set out at four different heights on the vertical faces.\\nThe Master Class Room is located on the western side of the building. Access to it is by the main side stairs which converge on the building\\'s different terraces. Over this hall there is a cafeteria and below this are the dressing rooms. This room is specially designed for live performances by small music ensembles and can be used for holding conferences.\\nThe Amphitheatre has seating for 1,500; its facilities include advanced sound, cinema and video systems for live performances and shows, and for projecting cultural events on large screens, including the opera performance in the main hall at the same time.\\nThere are also a number of other rooms necessary for staging productions. These include assembly and repair workshops for carpentry, mechanics, lighting \/ sound and wardrobe. There are also storage areas for scenery, flats, stage props and wardrobes, as well as storage for the sets of the different companies using the facility.\\nThere are also various types of rehearsal room, such as joint rehearsal rooms for song, dance or orchestra. These areas are connected to the dressing rooms, rest areas and cafeteria. In the private area, there are offices for general administration, artistic and technical direction, large rehearsal rooms, stage production room, VIP dressing rooms, individual dressing rooms for soloists and dressing rooms for extras, choir and orchestra.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}

The term vision refers to the complex of eye and brain.1 It is this complex which guides a broad spectrum of human abilities.\\nWe walk down a street, step up and down curbs, maneuver around objects and other pedestrians and adjust our pace, while visually monitoring our position. Moments later we get into our car, drive at highway speed through traffic and judge where we are relative to other vehicles while anticipating the flow of traffic. We arrive at baseball practice where we pick up a bat, walk to the plate, miss a curve ball, foul-off a fast ball and then hit a single, making numerous conscious and subconscious judgements with varying degrees of success. After practice, we stop by the mall, scan the crowd for our friend, and go to the bookstore to find the book we might want to purchase. Over a no-foam latte, we read the opening chapter, seeing if it captures our attention.\\nOur vision plays an essential role in each of these activities through the collaboration of eyes and brain.\\nThe retina is a thin sheet of brain tissue in the eyes. It is the place where the brain first encounters light.2 Signals travel back-and-forth between the eyes and the rest of the brain. Visual processing involves several major sub-cortical centers plus a mosaic of dozens of distinct areas in the cerebral cortex.10 It is currently acknowledged that vision is the result of parallel, distributed processing in multiple areas and through multiple pathways.11 For example, information gathered by the retina about color is processed in a different area of the brain than information about movement.4\\nAs another example, egocentric direction describes the perceived location of an object compared to our body. This is derived from a combination of oculocentric direction (where our eyes are aimed), position of the eyes in the head, and the head\u2019s position relative to the body. The brain uses a reference point midway between the two eyes, known as the egocenter to compute egocentric direction.12 Enabling the brain to engage a whole body experience, binocular vision is an intricate organization of biologic and psychologic components.7\\nThe majority of nerve cells from the retina project to the visual cortex. However, at least ten percent of the nerve cells take a different pathway8 stimulating areas of the brain stem dedicated to functions that seem remote to vision, when vision is narrowly defined.9 The existence of extensive sensory motor pathways supports a broader conceptualization of vision, integrating functions such as balance and visual-auditory localization.13\\n\u201cAs surely as the old system (for explaining vision) considered that the problem of knowledge and understanding could be separated from the problem of seeing, so the present one will find it increasingly difficult to draw a dividing line between the two.\u201d3\\nMany aspects of the optometric examination probe the eye-brain collaboration. Consider the complexity of the evaluation of visual fields. A patient is instructed to simultaneously maintain steady central fixation, attend to central and peripheral stimuli, discriminate threshold stimuli, and demonstrate awareness with an appropriate motor response.\\nSimilarly, the clinical assessment of color vision requires more than the discrimination of colors. Every color test has multiple perceptual components. For example, color vision plates require recognition of form and the emergence of figure from background. Color cap tests (Farnsworth) are predicated on good sequencing abilities and subtle discriminatory skills.\\nThe process of binocular vision is a reflection of complex interactions within the eye-brain continuum. For neural binocular summation to occur, inputs from both eyes to the brain must be synchronized in both space and time.5 Alignment of the eyes is maintained via ongoing collaboration of eyes and brain. Binocular dysfunctions such as suppression and anomalous correspondence demonstrate cortical adaptations in the eye-brain function to minimize visual confusion and maintain some level of visual performance.6\\nIt is evident that, beyond eye health, optometrists evaluate a wide variety of visual abilities. These include visual-spatial orientation skills, visual analysis skills (including auditory-visual integration, visual discrimination, visual figure-ground perception, visual closure, visual memory, and visualization), visual motor integration skills, and visual-verbal integration skills.14\\nInformation from neuroimaging and insights from cognitive neuroscience demand a significant reformulation of the understanding of vision. Vision occurs neither in the eyes nor in the brain, but emerges from the collaboration of the eyes and the rest of the brain. Vision is a pervasive aspect of our existence which permeates all of our activities. Vision develops and, due to neural plasticity, can be enhanced. Optometry is the discipline dedicated to the care of all aspects of the visual process.\\nThis publication was formulated by the American Optometric Association\u2019s Binocular Vision Working Group.

However, some evidence has found that tapering does not guarantee that a person will not experience brain zaps or other symptoms of withdrawal.\\nHow long after stopping antidepressants before I feel normal again?\\nSymptoms of antidepressant withdrawal depend on the specific medication you have been taking. Symptoms most often occur within three days of stopping the antidepressant. They are usually mild and go away within about two weeks.\\nWhat is antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?\\nAntidepressant discontinuation syndrome, also called antidepressant withdrawal syndrome, is a condition that can occur following the interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of antidepressant medication that was taken continuously for at least one month.\\nShould I worry about sharp pains in my head?\\nHeadache symptoms you should worry about. A headache typically causes pain in your head, face, or neck area. Get urgent medical attention if you have severe, unusual pain or other signs and symptoms. Your headache may be a sign of an underlying illness or health condition.\\nWhat is a brain zap feel like?\\nBrain zaps are commonly described as a \u201cbuzz\u201d or \u201cjolt\u201d in the brain or as a \u201cwhite light mixed with dizziness.\u201d Some clients say brain zaps feel like an \u201celectrical buzz\u201d inside the head. Dizziness and vertigo are common during these episodes.\\nAre brain zaps a seizure?\\nLow levels of this brain chemical may trigger seizures. This leads some to believe that brain shakes are actually very minor, localized seizures. But this theory hasn\u2019t been confirmed, and there\u2019s no evidence that brain shakes have negative or long-term health effects.\\nWhat does it mean when you feel something moving in your head?\\nCauses of crawling sensations on the scalp include delusional infestations, hallucination, substance abuse, a parasitic infestation, side effects from medication, or issues with the neurologic system. Read below for more information on why you may feel like bug are crawling on your head.\\nHow do you know if you have serotonin syndrome?\\nSerotonin is a chemical your body produces that\u2019s needed for your nerve cells and brain to function. But too much serotonin causes signs and symptoms that can range from mild (shivering and diarrhea) to severe (muscle rigidity, fever and seizures). Severe serotonin syndrome can cause death if not treated.\\nWhy does it feel like something is crawling in my ear but nothing\u2019s there?\\nThe external ear and the outer side of the eardrum have several cranial nerves that relay information to the brain. A foreign object, such as a bug, can irritate these nerves. The insect might still be alive and may be crawling or buzzing, which could cause odd sensations in the ear.\\nWhat causes brain shocks?\\nIt\u2019s a hard phenomenon to describe, but essentially a brain zap feels like a little electric shock. It can be triggered by noises or sudden movement, or just happen randomly. It\u2019s akin to someone sticking a wet finger in your ear, a spider crawling up the back of your neck, or a sudden flash of lightening.\\nHow long do brain zaps last after stopping SSRI?\\nWith discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms eventually go away, usually within one to three weeks.\\nWhat does it mean when your head tingles?\\nStress or anxiety Stress can sometimes lead to tingling in the head. Stressful situations activate your body\u2019s fight-or-flight response. Stress hormones, such as norepinephrine, direct blood to the areas of the body that need it most. As a result, you might experience tingling or a lack of sensation in other areas.\\nWhy do I feel something moving around my body?\\nFormication is the feeling of insects crawling across or underneath your skin. The name comes from the Latin word \u201cformica,\u201dwhich means ant. Formication is known as a type of paresthesia. Paresthesia happen when you feel sensations on your skin that don\u2019t have a physical cause.\\nWhy do I feel so weird in the head?\\nMost conditions that result in head pressure aren\u2019t cause for alarm. Common ones include tension headaches, conditions that affect the sinuses, and ear infections. Abnormal or severe head pressure is sometimes a sign of a serious medical condition, such as a brain tumor or aneurysm.\\nWhy is Effexor withdrawal so bad?\\nBecause of the drug\u2019s profound impact on the brain\u2019s chemistry, stopping the medication can lead to Effexor withdrawal, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting and mood swings. If you have been prescribed the drug, here\u2019s what you need to know.\\nWhat are electric shock sensations?\\nElectric shock sensation or ESS can feel like a rubber band snapping against part of your body or a zing of electricity shooting through you.\\nWhat is neuralgia in the head?\\nPage of.

This contribution is not only direct, through the higher productivity of the migrants themselves, but also indirect, by raising the productivity of the native human capital through transfer of know-how.\\nBorjas (1995) also explores when immigration can be beneficial for economic growth. When immigrants\u2019 skills are sufficiently different from native workers\u2019 skills, and when their characteristics are complementary to the native factors of production, this can lead to an \u201cimmigration surplus\u201d.

Hornung (2014) analyses the impact of this mass skilled migration on host productivity growth.\\nAbout 20,000 people went to Brandenburg-Prussia (which had a population of about 1.5 million), and about 5,000 to Berlin, where they represented about 20% of the town\u2019s total population. The Huguenots were known for being well educated and holding skilled occupations.\\nThe Prussian King, Friederich Wilhelm I, selected Huguenots according to their skills and assigned them to the Prussians towns depopulated by the Thirty Years\u2019 War and the Black Death.\\nHornung uses the historic records of this natural experiment where Huguenots were placed in selected Prussian towns, in combination with firm-level data on the value of inputs and outputs for all 693 textile manufactories in Prussian towns in 1802. He finds that immigration had long-term positive effects on productivity in textile manufacturing, where the Huguenots had specific skills.\\nImmigration had long-term positive effects on productivity.\\nThe effects found are sizeable: a 1 percentage point increase in the share of Huguenots in 1705 led to a 1.4 percentage point increase in productivity in textile manufacturing in 1802. Most effects were indirect, through technology transfers which increased the productivity of local textile plants.\\nEven if the Huguenot manufacturing plants did not survive, technology was transferred to local manufacturing plants by training workers. However, these indirect transfers took a long time to materialize, due to the gap in native textile skills in Prussia at the time and to language issues.\\nMass migration from Nazi Germany\\nThe Jewish migrants who left Germany for the United States in the 1930s and 1940s are another example of forced mass skilled migration. By 1944, over 133,000 German Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s had found refuge in the United States. Most were urban white-collar workers and one fifth were university graduates.\\nMoser, Voena and Waldinger (2014) use the research fields in which dismissed German Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 chemists were specialized pre-1933, and compare changes in U.S. patenting by U.S. inventors in these research fields with changes in U.S. patenting by U.S. inventors in the fields of other German chemists.\\nGerman Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 chemists led to a 71 percent increase in local patenting.\\nThe authors find sizeable positive effects. They estimate a 71 percent increase in local patenting. The authors also document the multiple channels through which these effects materialized:\\n- The arrival of the migrants encouraged U.S. inventions by helping to attract new domestic inventors to the research fields of \u00e9migr\u00e9s, rather than by increasing the productivity of incumbent U.S. inventors in these fields;\\n- Co-inventors of migrants became active patentees in the fields of migrants especially after 1940, and continued patenting through the 1950s;\\n- Co-inventors of co-inventors of migrants also substantially increased their inventive activity in \u00e9migr\u00e9 fields after 1933, and remained substantially more productive throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\\nPotential effects of low-skilled migration\\nPreliminary work by Rachel Harris suggests that mass migration may positively impact host economies\u2019 innovation capacity, even if migrants are low-skilled. She studied the Mariel Boatlift, a mass emigration of Cubans to the USA in 1980, as a natural experiment.\\nLittle precise information is available on how many people came to the United States during the Mariel Boatlift or exactly where they settled. The most reliable sources (Card, 1990) indicate that between April 1980 and June 1981, 120.000-126.000 Cubans entered the US labour market, about half settling in Miami, and half in the rest of Florida. Many of the migrants were low-skilled and had a low level of English.\\nNevertheless, Harris finds that the Mariel Boatlift caused an increase in patents in Florida, in technological categories with low barriers to entry. She suggests that this could be because individual inventors had access to a large supply of low-skilled labourers, and were able to hire them to do housework, child care and other manual work. This allowed these inventors to substitute away from housework and spend more time inventing, leading to an increase in patenting.\\nLessons for the current crisis\\nFrom these historical studies it can be seen that skilled migration can have a substantial effect on productivity growth in the host economies. But this requires migrants\u2019 skills to be matched to the needs of host economies.\\nSkilled migration can have a substantial effect on productivity growth in the host economies.\\nUnfortunately, reliable systematic data on the skills of the current migration wave is not widely available. One of the most up-to-date sources of information is from the Swedish Employment Services, where refugees are asked to provide information on their education as part of an \u2018establishment programme\u2019.\\nIn 2015, most of the refugees accepted onto the programme had less than 9 years of education, as shown in the figure below. Interestingly however, the second biggest share of refugees had higher education. This bodes well for the long term impact of migrants\u2019 skills on the host economy.\\nIf Europe wants to capitalize on the potential for long term effects on productivity growth from its migrants, European leaders must better balance migrants\u2019 skills and the needs of host countries.\\nEuropean leaders must better balance migrants\u2019 skills and the needs of host countries.\\nCurrently it is not possible to match migrants to the skills base of the host regions in Europe, as systematic information on incoming skills is missing.\\nA better information system on the incoming migrants\u2019 skills is needed, in order to match migrants better with the hosting environments, and ensure that their potential to boost innovation and productivity growth is not wasted.\\nPositive spillover effects from matched skills will also be larger and faster with smaller language barriers. The earlier migrants can take language courses, the quicker they can integrate into the labour market and the faster spillover effects can materialize.\\nImplementing this information system, and matching skills and environments at the European level would benefit migrants and host countries on a larger scale. It would reduce fixed set up costs, and allow for better matches.\\nRepublishing and referencing\\nBruegel considers itself a public good and takes no institutional standpoint.

Because they are intensely anxious about taking care of themselves, they become excessively dependent and submissive.\\nFewer than 1% of the general US population are estimated to have dependent personality disorder. It is diagnosed more often in women, but in some studies, prevalence in men and women was similar.\\nComorbidities are common. Patients often also have a depressive disorder (major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder), an anxiety disorder, an alcohol use disorder, or another personality disorder (eg, borderline, histrionic).\\nInformation about the causes of dependent personality disorder is limited. Cultural factors, negative early experiences, and biologic vulnerabilities associated with anxiety are thought to contribute to the development of dependent personality disorder. Familial traits such as submissiveness, insecurity, and self-effacing behavior may also contribute.\\nPatients with dependent personality disorder do not think they can take care of themselves. They use submissiveness to try to get other people to take care of them.\\nPatients with this disorder typically require much reassurance and advice when making ordinary decisions. They often let others, often one person, take responsibility for many aspects of their life. For example, they may depend on their spouse to tell them what to wear, what kind of job to look for, and whom to associate with.\\nThese patients consider themselves inferior and tend to belittle their abilities; they take any criticism or disapproval as proof of their incompetence, further undermining their confidence.\\nIt is difficult for them to express disagreement with others because they fear losing support or approval. They may agree to something they know is wrong rather than risk losing the help of others. Even when anger is appropriate, they do not get angry at friends and co-workers for fear of losing their support.\\nBecause these patients are sure that they cannot do anything on their own, they have difficulty starting a new task and working independently, and they avoid tasks that require taking responsibility. They present themselves as incompetent and needing constant help and reassurance. When reassured that a competent person is supervising and approving of them, these patients tend to function adequately. However, they do not want to appear too competent lest they be abandoned. As a result, their career may be harmed. They perpetuate their dependency because they tend not to learn skills of independent living.\\nThese patients go to great lengths to obtain care and support (eg, doing unpleasant tasks, submitting to unreasonable demands, tolerating physical, sexual, or emotional abuse). Being alone makes them feel extremely uncomfortable or afraid because they fear they cannot take care of themselves.\\nPatients with dependent personality disorder tend to interact socially with only the few people they depend on. When a close relationship ends, patients with this disorder immediately try to find a replacement. Because of their desperate need to be taken care of, they are not discriminating in choosing a replacement.\\nThese patients fear abandonment by those they depend on, even when there is no reason to.\\nFor a diagnosis of dependent personality disorder, patients must have\\nThis persistent need is shown by the presence of \u2265 5 of the following:\\nDifficulty making daily decisions without an inordinate amount of advice and reassurance from other people\\nA need to have others be responsible for most important aspects of their life\\nDifficulty expressing disagreement with others because they fear loss of support or approval\\nDifficulty starting projects on their own because they are not confident in their judgment and\/or abilities (not because they lack motivation or energy)\\nWillingness to go to great lengths (eg, do unpleasant tasks) to obtain support from others\\nFeelings of discomfort or helplessness when they are alone because they fear they cannot take of themselves\\nAn urgent need to establish a new relationship with someone who will provide care and support when a close relationship ends\\nUnrealistic preoccupation with fears of being left to take care of themselves\\nAlso, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood.\\nSeveral other personality disorders are characterized by hypersensitivity to rejection. However, they can be distinguished from dependent personality disorder based on characteristic features, as follows:\\nBorderline personality disorder: Patients with this disorder are too frightened to submit to the same degree of control as patients with dependent personality disorder. Patients with borderline personality disorder, unlike those with dependent personality disorder, vacillate between submissiveness and rageful hostility.\\nAvoidant personality disorder: Patients with this disorder are also too frightened to submit to the same degree of control as patients with dependent personality disorder. Patients with avoidant personality disorder withdraw until they are sure they will be accepted without criticism; in contrast, those with dependent personality disorder seek out and try to maintain relationships with others.\\nHistrionic personality disorder: Patients with this disorder seek attention rather than reassurance (as do those with dependent personality disorder), but they are more disinhibited. They are more flamboyant and actively seek attention; those with dependent personality disorder are self-effacing and shy.\\nGeneral treatment of dependent personality disorder is similar to that for all personality disorders.\\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy that focus on examining fears of independence and difficulties with assertiveness can help patients with dependent personality disorder. Clinicians should be careful not to promote dependency in the therapy relationship.\\nEvidence about drug therapy for dependent personality disorder is sparse. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are effective in avoidant personality disorder, may be effective, as may selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\\nBenzodiazepines are not used because patients with dependent personality disorder have an increased risk of drug dependency.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"factoid","error":null,"n":1}

It is clear that many of the current uses of the forest just destroy it, with massive long term impacts. However, the countries and people of rainforests need to make a living, and sustainable uses of forests offer them a way to do just that.\\nSelective logging and replanting,\\nSelective logging is selective because loggers choose only wood that is highly valued, such as mahogany. Clear-cutting is not selective. Selective logging is more sustainable than clear-cutting because other trees and plants do survive in the logging process and over time can allow the forest to recover. However, it does have major drawbacks. Although single trees are felled because they are valuable, other trees can be damaged in the process. This is because a felled tree can damage other trees as it falls to the ground once felled. Also, loggers need to access the wood, so have to clear come forest to make way for machinery.\\nEcotourism, conservation and education\\nConservation is all about the protection, preservation, management, or restoration of tropical forests and the ecological communities that inhabit them. In this case conservation would seek to manage human use of natural resources in tropical rainforests for sustainable social and economic uses. This includes the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program (ARPA), where the WWF work with the Brazilian government to protect parks covering 150million acres of forest.\\nAnother sustainable use is the development of ecotourism. Ecotourism is environmentally friendly tourism where;\\n\u2022 the people involved seek to protect the environment as much as possible\\n\u2022 there is education of the visitor\\n\u2022 some of the profits go back into conserving the rainforest environment\\n\u2022 the tourism is small scale with low visitor densities\\n\u2022 local people are employed and involved\\nBelow is an ecotourism lodge where tours of the Amazon forest take place. The tourist stay in wooden huts, there is limited electricity, waste is dealt with on site and the food is sourced locally. All of the tour guides are local.\\nInternational agreements about the use of tropical hardwoods\\nThere are also international agreements on the uses of tropical hardwoods and logging. The International Tropical Timber Agreement was set up in 2006 to \"promote the expansion and diversification of international trade in tropical timber from sustainably managed and legally harvested forests and to promote the sustainable management of tropical timber producing forests\".\\n71 countries have signed up to the agreement sponsored by the United Nations.\\nThe rainforests are often found in poorer countries that want to exploit them. Debt reduction or conservation swaps offer an alternative to poorer countries to the reckless exploitation of their natural wealth.\\nThese swaps basically see poorer countries have portions of their debts wiped out or paid for by richer nations or charities of richer nations in exchange for promising to protect or CONSERVE large parts of their natural environment. This has large scale global effects, by protecting the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. In 1984 the World Wildlife Fund came up with the idea of conservation swaps and in 1987 the first was launched in partnership between the Government of Bolivia and Conservation International (CI) for US$ 650000 which protected 3 natural areas.

{"id":919,"question":"why were vanth and charun considered essential protectors for deceased souls","gold":"Vanth and Charun were essential protectors because the Etruscan Underworld was filled with dangerous monsters that souls needed protection from. These threats included familiar creatures like Cerberus (the three-headed dog), Geryon (the giant warrior), and the Gorgons (whose gaze could turn people to stone), among other perils. While some underworld entities could be malevolent, Vanth and Charun were generally considered protective figures who helped souls survive their journey through these dangers. Charun specifically acted as a protector of the dead, using his hammer to ward off evil spirits from the tomb.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:4ca426f2-2531-4dd6-b1fb-f9d9c10e87b6>']","texts":"['On the walls of a 300 BCE Etruscan tomb, a winged woman of dark and stern gaze flanks a door to the unknown. Her name is Vanth, and she often makes an appearance in violent scenes where one or more of the individuals depicted is on the verge of death. Is she the angel of Death, or perhaps Death\u2019s messenger? If we have a closer look at the objects that she carries \u2013a bunch of keys and a burning torch \u2014 we\u2019ll realise that her role is that of a psychopomp, a liminal entity who guides the newly deceased into the Great Unknown: the Otherworld.\\nWhat we know about the Etruscans is largely based on tomb inscriptions and funerary art, since very few of their written records remain. This has only intensified their aura of mystery, a projection of the conspicuous Etruscan smile, secret and enigmatic, frozen on the lips of the funerary statues of those who have crossed the threshold and therefore know secrets beyond our reach.\\nLike the Greeks, the Etruscans believed in the existence of a Realm of the Dead, but the journey towards it wasn\u2019t necessarily smooth. It would begin with the burial rites performed by the family: funerary urns depict a procession, similar to the Roman pompa funebris, but in this case there are demons mingling with the living. We don\u2019t know whether they can be seen or sensed by mere mortals, but together they take the remains of the recently deceased to the door that separates this world from the Otherworld. It is at this point that the living must stay behind.\\nRepresentations of this door usually appear on the far wall of Etruscan tombs, always guarded by demons, part male or female, part monster or beast. Vanth, the winged demoness, is probably the most recurrent gatekeeper. Her keys open the gate, her torch lights the dark paths of the Underworld. The serpents around her arms reveal her liminal nature: snakes, always in contact with the earth, are frequent companions to chthonic entities.\\nVanth is usually depicted with hunting boots, a short pleated skirt, and straps across her bare breasts \u2013 the attire of a Greek huntress. This is one of the reasons why she\u2019s been suggested to have a Greek origin, perhaps inspired by the Erinyes, infernal goddesses of vengeance, also winged, but far more fearsome.\\nShe is often accompanied by a less benevolent-looking hybrid figure, one with animal ears, pointed teeth, and snakes twined around his arms. Funerary inscriptions reveal his name is Charun \u2013 probably an adaptation of Charon, the Greek ferryman who begrudgingly escorts souls to Hades. Showing the decay of death in his bluish complexion, the Etruscan Charun is armed with a hammer, which he sometimes swings over a person\u2019s head in a threatening manner. His brutish impulse may indicate that he isn\u2019t merely a psychopomp, but also a protector of the dead, in charge of fending off evil spirits from the tomb.\\nIntriguingly, the doors guarded by Vanth and Charun may sometimes be half open, so we can catch a glimpse of the other realm. Some depictions, such as the sarcophagus of Hasti Afunei, are rather ambiguous, but it would seem as if the dead have come to open the door from the inside. These figures aren\u2019t malevolent, they\u2019re likely family members whose function is to greet newcomers and reassure them as they are about to enter the Great Unknown.\\nThe most dangerous part of the journey would indeed start on the other side. Since Vanth appears escorting the dead in different ways (on horseback, wagon or chariot) it is reasonable to think that the transit probably had different stages. Depictions of sea monsters suggest that at some point or other the deceased would have to face a sea voyage. The rocky coastline painted on the walls of the Tomb of the Blue Demons (c. 400 BCE), where a legion of demons awaits by a skiff, seems to reinforce this idea.\\nVanth and Charun might have been used as collective names for death demons in later Etruscan periods. We know the names of other creatures who show similar characteristics: the bearded Tuchulcha, whose gender is debated by scholars, has wings and a beak, and wields a mallet; the enigmatic Culsu carries a pair of scissors, perhaps to severe the soul from the body.\\nWhereas some of these entities could be more malevolent, there seems to be a general consensus in the protective roles of Vanth and Charun. The Etruscan Underworld was plagued by monsters (some of them as familiar as Cerberus, the three-headed dog who guards the entrance to Hades; Geryon, the giant warrior; or the Gorgons, whose gaze could turn a man into stone). All these perils, and those that we don\u2019t know, given the scarcity of written sources, suggest that the presence of the stern Vanth and the brutal Charun were essential for the survival of the soul.\\nNancy Thomson de Grummond, 2006.

{"id":454,"question":"how many horses required eagala model equine assisted psychotherapy session","gold":"The EAGALA model of Equine Assisted Psychotherapy requires a small herd of three to five horses during a session, along with a licensed mental health professional and a horse specialist.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:585b151a-da4a-4a51-a7d7-258c09d70380>']","texts":"['Equine Time is Sydney\u2019s first Equine Assisted Psychotherapy Programme. Equine Time started on the 6th May 2009 at Mowbray Park Farm, a natural horsemanship property at Picton on the south west outskirts of Sydney. Visit our website at equinetime.com.au.\\nI first read about Equine Assisted Psychotherapy in the Australian Journal of Counselling Psychology Summer 2005 (Frewin and Gardiner). Having been a lover of horses since childhood I was fascinated by what I read, so I decided to learn more about Equine Assisted Psychotherapy. Since then I have attended several trainings to become an accredited Equine Assisted Psychotherapist with EAGALA (Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association). EAGALA is an international association which aims to provide standards of practice, education, innovation, and support to professionals providing services in Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAGALA 2008).\\nWhat is Equine Assisted Psychotherapy?\\nEquine assisted psychotherapy is not a horse riding programme. The EAGALA model of EAP utilizes ground activities in a large enclosed space in which the horses run free. It is conducted by a licensed mental health professional, a horse specialist and a small herd of three to five horses. In a session the client is invited to undertake a groundwork activity with the horses. At the end of the session the client is invited to verbalise their experience and the equine specialist will reflect their observations of the horse\u2019s behaviour during the session. The therapist then picks up on constructs that are important to the client, in line with the client\u2019s therapy goals.\\nThe horses are regarded as members of the therapy team. Their size and power demand respect. They are prey animals and will flee the instant something in their surroundings is out of balance. Horses have a natural curiosity, they have different personalities and they are extremely perceptive to human emotions. They are experts at non-verbal communication and body language. They will mirror human behaviour.\\nHorses are social animals and live by the rules of the herd. As in human relationships equine relationships require effective communication and co-operation. Co-operation is important because each member of the herd relies on the others for their safety.\\nHorses are non-judgemental, they do not have prejudices, they have no expectations, they are not influenced by appearance or life situation. They have no hidden agendas, they have no regard for external measures of success as humans do, they respond immediately without assumption or criticism. They hold people accountable for who they are in the relationship with them at that point in time (Aspen Ranch n.d., Kaleidoscope Learning Circle 2005, Kohanov 2001, Frewin and Gardiner 2005, O\u2019Connor n.d.).\\nWhy Equine assisted psychotherapy?\\nThe research literature demonstrates the effectiveness of EAP for children with depression and anxiety (McCann 2001), children with difficult behaviours (Tetreault 2006), and children and adolescents \u201cat-risk\u201d with maladaptive behaviours (Trotter 2006). Significant improvement in behaviour was reported for incarcerated adolescents (Mann 1998) and for adolescents with disruptive behaviours (Greenwald 2001). Mann and Williams (2002) found a significant improvement in adolescents with conduct disorders, mood disorders and psychotic disorders who failed to make progress in traditional therapy settings. Other studies found significant improvement in adolescents with depression, anxiety and low self esteem (Crawly et al 1994, Bowers and MacDonald 2001, Kaiser et al 2004 and Schultz 2005, Bullock and Gable 2006). One therapist stated \u201cI have learned more about a teen in one horse session, than in a month of individual work\u201d (Barbara Lester, Woodbury Reports 2002).\\nSeveral studies of EAP with adults have shown significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety (Scheidhacker et.al. 2002), unresolved grief (Klontz et al 2007), depression, anxiety and social disorders (Burgon 2003) and eating disorders (Christian 2005).\\nRussell-Martin (2006) compared the improvement in the couple relationship between 10 couples who attended six sessions of solution-focused therapy and 10 couples who attended six sessions of EAP. She found that the EAP couples reported significantly higher improvement than the solution-focused therapy couples.\\nLancia (2008) demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms of PTSD in war veterans.\\nEquine assisted psychotherapy is being used for individual work, couple work and family therapy. Many of the studies are suggesting that treatment duration is minimised as the equine sessions bring issues to the surface more quickly than in talking therapy (Kersten & Thomas 2005a, Trevelyan 2005).\\nExploration of some of the concepts from Personal Construct Psychology to underpin the therapeutic value of the EAGALA model of EAP.\\nKelly\u2019s Fundamental postulate states \u201ca person\u2019s processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which they anticipate events\u201d. A horse\u2019s hypervigilence and instantaneous flight response can also be explained by this postulate. The survival instinct of the horse can assist humans to clarify their own processes.\\nThe conditions necessary for the formation of new constructs are the use of a fresh set of elements, experimentation and the availability of validating data.\\nA fresh set of elements means that the person is not restricted by their existing constructs. Greg Neimeyer used the word \u201cnovelty\u201d to describe the quality of this fresh set of elements. The word novelty means \u201ca new and unusual thing\u201d (Websters Dictionary). An implied meaning of the word novelty is that the thing does not produce a fear response but instead gives rise to a person\u2019s curiosity.\\nEAP provides an environment that is likely to be outside the client\u2019s experience and while Kelly names the therapist as a fresh element, the horses and the horse specialist are also fresh elements in the novel environment. Kelly cautions that the new context ought not involve \u201cthe self\u201d or \u201cmembers of the immediate family\u201d until such time that the person finds some usefulness in the emerging constructs coming from the new environment. In the EAGALA model of EAP the observations made are \u201cclean\u201d observations of the horses behaviour during the session. The client is invited to reflect on their learning through awareness of the horses behaviour during the session. Much of the psychological processing occurs between therapy sessions as the person reflects on their specific learning and experiments with it in other situations which are likely to be with self or family. Kelly also states that the environment ought not be so complex that the person is unable to use their moment-to-moment anticipations. In the EAGALA model the activities given are stated as simply as \u201cgo and meet the horses and choose one\u201d. A followup session may include \u201cchoose a horse and bring it back here\u201d. The client may wish to work on the same task over several sessions.\\nThe use of stories will also assist the development of the new constructs before the self is involved. In the EAP session the therapist may ask the client to tell a story about what just happened. It is likely that the person will tell the story about the horses. The self is only involved after the elements in the story have gained usefulness, and gradually the new construct from the story will replace the old constructs that have outlived their usefulness.\\nKelly states that the playing out of artificial roles is very useful for the formation of new constructs. He states that \u201cThe patent artificiality of the role is the very feature which prevents the tender shoots of new ideas from being trampled in the frantic rush to maintain oneself in their previous role.\u201d (p. 161) To attempt the role of being in control of a large and powerful animal that is free to run away is likely to be seen as an artificial role for most people. To believe that this is possible is beyond most people\u2019s anticipations. When the horse responds willingly the client must reconstrue rapidly in order to maintain their anticipatory system.\\n\u201cAn atmosphere of experimentation\u201d (Kelly 1955\/63 p 162) is important for the formation of new constructs. For Kelly, the word experimentation meant that one variable was attempted to be isolated from all other variables and this one variable is the one acted upon. The more careful we are to isolate one construct or anticipation to act upon the more likely we are to gain a precise outcome. When the client can see clearly the process involved and the result, their anticipation will be clearly validated or invalidated. The clear nature of the tasks set in the EAGALA model and the clear outcome provided by the horse allows for such experimental conditions to exclude as many extraneous variables as possible.\\nIn an experimental situation the consequences of the experiment are limited. Kelly states \u201cone does not play for keeps\u201d (p.163). Thus a construct may be shifted from what the client believes to be reality as a possible representation of reality. Once this occurs the construct becomes more open to variation or replacement. The horses become metaphors for the client, and as such the client is able to loosen their construing to enable alternative possibilities.\\nClients have the opportunity to make a new prediction and experiment with their behaviours to find the best fit. In the EAGALA model a client is offered the freedom to \u2018trial\u2019 various strategies with the horses and they quickly learn the relationship between prediction and response through the horse\u2019s immediate response. These trials are experiments in role constructs and are particularly useful for people wishing to improve their relationships as the horses will act to maintain their own safety.\\nKelly states \u201cA construct is a framework for making predictions\u201d (p 163). If the outcome doesn\u2019t fit the prediction a person may begin to change their prediction. They may alternatively try to force the outcome so as to make it fit the prediction. Horses are very good at not responding to the way a person wants them to if force is used. The use of force makes the problem more difficult to solve. In a very short time a person will give up completely or begin to change the construct they are using to predict their desired outcome. Thus horses provide clear invalidation for constructs that are not in line with \u201cshared control\u201d and hence validate constructs in line with \u201cshared control\u201d. This construct is important for the well-being of human relationships.\\nOften in an EAP session an observer has little insight into what learning is taking place for the client. \u201cThe therapist must be careful not to assume learning by results, or results by learning\u201d (Kelly). What the client learns is what is important and necessary to their construct system, and not necessarily noticeable to the therapist. Sometimes the client may need to form intermediate constructs which to an observer may appear as unsuccessful trials. Kelly states that \u201cthe availability of validating data implies skill on the part of the therapist\u201d (p. 164) and in an EAGALA model session the therapist may provide validating data, but essentially that is the role of the horses. The horses provide non-verbal validation and invalidation to the client in response to the non-verbal constructs of the client. \u201cThose things that the client has been unaware of are now brought into awareness\u201d (Kelly). Kelly states \u201cthe role-playing exchange is an excellent way of enabling the client to try out new constructs which have immediate access to validating material.\u201d The horse\u2019s response is immediate, and helps the client to see more clearly in a construct, its prediction, action and response. The direct link between a client\u2019s action and the horse\u2019s response can provide very precise evidence for the construct on trial. Horses do not confuse their response with some previous event, as humans are often inclined to do which makes for difficulty when a person seeks validation from other humans.\\nKelly points out that it would be more helpful to the client for the therapist to ask the client what are the client\u2019s questions. The EAGALA model of EAP offers the client the opportunity to ask their own questions in the experimental environment with the horses. Very often when the client has formulated their own question, they can find an answer that fits for them. Is it possible for a client to ask a question of a horse? Can a horse sense this and provide them with the answer they need?\\nThe use of horses in psychotherapy is rapidly gaining acceptance throughout the world as people experience its therapeutic benefit. The body of research evidence is growing and practitioners are gaining a more precise understanding of the important aspects of the therapeutic process. To be accepted as a valid psychological therapy, the EAGALA model of equine assisted psychotherapy needs to be grounded in an historically trusted theory to ensure its ethical sustainability. Personal Construct Psychology provides a substantive foundation for the EAGALA model of equine assisted psychotherapy.\\nAspen Ranch n.d. Why are horses therapeutic?

{"id":777,"question":"I had a tooth extraction recently and I'm worried about nerve damage. What causes nerve damage during dental procedures and what symptoms should I look out for?","gold":"Nerve damage during dental procedures can occur due to several causes, including improper administration of local anesthesia (injecting too close to a nerve or applying too much pressure), excessive force during tooth extraction, and surgical errors during procedures. Common symptoms of nerve damage include numbness or tingling sensation in the affected area, loss of taste or altered taste perception, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and persistent pain or discomfort. These symptoms may appear immediately or develop over time. The most commonly affected nerves are the inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve, which are responsible for sensation in the lower jaw and tongue. While nerve damage is relatively rare, temporary nerve bruising can last from several days to several months, though in rare cases it might be permanent.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:de1692d2-c21d-4076-bac2-8e1c9ceaf465>', '<urn:uuid:08a96bbd-e8b6-455e-a839-62f87a0a0c88>']","texts":"['Complications may occur after tooth extraction procedure. Some complications after tooth extraction are common and some are not that common. Extraction is painless removal of tooth or tooth roots with minimum trauma to the surrounding tissues so that the extraction socket wound heals uneventfully without any post-operative complications. Tooth extraction complication symptoms are prolonged pain; swelling, bleeding, bruising, limited mouth opening and many others. Various Tooth extraction complications are discussed in detail in this article.\\nPain as Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nIt is the most common complication which occurs after the tooth extraction procedure. After the tooth removal, there is bound to be some kind of discomfort and pain. The pain and soreness may last for few days after tooth extraction. Painkillers are given by the dentist to control the pain. Pain meds such as Ibuprofen, Tylenol, Paracetamol, Solpadeine or Nurofen Plus can be used to control the pain. The painkillers which are prescribed by the dentist are dependent on the medical history of the patient and the effortlessness with which the tooth was extracted.\\nSwelling after tooth extraction\\nSwelling is other common complication after tooth extraction. Swelling after tooth extraction procedure is a normal body reaction and is indicator of normal progress of healing of tooth extraction socket. If swelling persists beyond 1week, then the patient needs to visit the dentist. After extensive surgical interference, simple inflammatory edema appears in adjacent tissues in most of the cases. This is unavoidable and is generally commensurate with the degree of surgical trauma. Swelling usually occurs after the tooth removal. The swelling can be there for as long as few weeks. The swelling can be treated by using an ice-pack or by pressing a bag of frozen peas against the cheek near the tooth which is removed. This will help to lessen the swelling. Alcohol, hot foods and drinks and work out immediately after the tooth extraction can aggravate the swelling. Warm saline rinses and hot moist compresses 1-2 days after tooth extraction will further help in reducing the swelling.\\nBleeding after Tooth Extraction\\nBleeding is other common tooth extraction complication. Slight oozing of blood may occur for up to 24 hours after the tooth extraction. It is considered as normal. If the bleeding is continuing after tooth extraction, then the patient can put a piece of gauze pad on the bleeding socket area with equal pressure without irritating the socket.\\nGauze pack to stop bleeding\\nBiting on tea bags may also stop the bleeding. If there is prolonged oozing of blood even after 24 hours or incases of heavy bleeding after 1-2 hours after the tooth extraction, dentist should be consulted.\\nThere are some people who are more likely to bruise than others after tooth extraction. These are usually older people, people on aspirin or steroids as they tend to bruise much more easily. Intermittent ice packs should be given for the first 24 hours after the tooth extraction procedure followed with intermittent hot moist packs. It is not a gangrenous process and discoloration is due to bleeding into the tissues. Accumulation of red blood cells and subsequent break down of hemoglobin causes discoloration. The bruising can look quite prominent and might take weeks to disappear in some cases.\\nThis is the normal mouth opening but in Trismus, there is inability to open mouth normally\\nMany a time\u2019s the chewing muscles and the jaw joints are so sore after the tooth extraction that it becomes really difficult to open the mouth. This can happen for a few days after the extraction.\\nIn case the patient gets an infection after the tooth extraction in the tooth socket then he will not be able to open his mouth for a much longer period say as much as a week. Although Pain is the most common tooth extraction complication, trismus can become one of the more chronic and complicated problems to manage.\\nA person might also develop an infection in the socket after the surgical extraction of the tooth. This usually happens about 2 \u2013 4 days afterwards and one knows of it from the deep-seated throbbing pain, the bad breath that the person emits and the perpetual unpleasant taste left behind in the mouth. Dry socket is a painful tooth extraction complication. This kind of an infection is more bound to happen if a person smokes, use Contraceptive Pills or are on drugs such as steroids or if the bone cutting is done during the tooth extraction.\\nSecondary infection that is infection several days after tooth extraction may occur. It mostly occurs after surgical removal of wisdom tooth. The patient will have fever, abnormal swelling, pain or a salty or prolonged bad taste with or without discharge from the surgical site as post tooth extraction complication symptoms in case of secondary infection . To avoid this, patient has to maintain good oral hygiene and should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. To treat infections, antibiotics are given by the patient.\\nReaction to medications given after Tooth Extraction Procedure\\nThe pain meds and antibiotics which are given after tooth extraction may have side effects. A patient may experience nausea, vomiting, drowsiness from the medicines which are provided. Patient can consult his dentist in such cases and can tell him to change his medicines.\\nNumbness \/ Tingling \/Burning sensation after Tooth Extraction\\nNumbness and tingling sensation occurs when the nerve is damaged or is injured during the tooth extraction. Nerves are responsible for sensation in the tongue and lips and may get affected while giving the anesthesia. The nerves may get squashed, bruised or stretched which could result in numbness.\\nThis kind of nerve bruising is usually not permanent but in the rarest of rare cases it might be permanent as well. The temporary phase might go on for a long time and may last from several days to several months. No one can actually say how long the nerve will take to get rid of the nerve bruising and come back to its normal mode of functioning.\\nBony Flakes Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nSometimes, bony flakes also known as sequestra result from the sockets of the extracted teeth and the patient can feel the roughness with the tongue in the socket area. They may cause soreness and will interfere with the healing after tooth extraction. They need to be smoothened by the dentist. At times, the gums heal on their own whereas some times it becomes imperative to smoothen the underlying bone for healing to take place.\\nBleeding into Cheeks after Tooth Extraction\\nBleeding into the cheeks can result in swelling after tooth extraction which may be hard to feel. This could also go on to result in a difficulty in being able to open the mouth and also result in bruising at that particular spot. The swelling, bruising and mouth opening will all get better with time and come back to normal.\\nPeriodontal damage Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nPeriodontal damage may occur after tooth extraction. Periodontal pocket may occur after wisdom tooth extraction if the tooth is deeply impacted and there is no bone between second and third molars. To treat periodontal pocket, scaling and root planning is done. Gum surgery may be required to treat it. Gum tissue may be deteriorated after tooth extraction.\\nLudwig\u2019s Angina Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nIt is a rapidly spreading infection of floor of mouth and is life threatening. Fascial spaces are affected in this. Difficulty in breathing, difficulty in mouth opening, swelling and severe pain is Ludwig\u2019s angina complication symptoms. Though it is extremely rare but one still needs to take extreme care if one gets infected by Ludwig\u2019s angina.\\nOsteonecrosis Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nIt is a rare dental condition which may occur after tooth extraction or other invasive procedure. In this condition, there is no sign of healing even after 8weeks of dental extraction. The gums are worn away in this condition and underlying bone is visible. This condition is mostly seen in cancer patients.\\nOsteomyelitis Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nIt is a rare Tooth extraction complication. Osteomyelitis may occur after tooth extraction. There is inflammation of bone and bone marrow in this condition. In case of acute osteomyelitis, there is severe throbbing deep seated pain present along with swelling. The teeth may be loose and pus may extrude from the socket. Fever and enlargement of lymph nodes may be present. In case of chronic osteomyelitis, there may be fistula and sinus tract formation on skin and mucosa.\\nPost extraction Granuloma Complication after Tooth Extraction\\nThis complication happens four to five days after tooth extraction. The main reason for it to occur is a foreign body in the tooth socket that starts the infection and allows it to set in. This could be the result of e.g. amalgam remnants which is from the tooth filling, bone chips, small tooth pieces, calculus etc. The way this works is that the foreign bodies aggravate the area and this goes on to stop the post-extraction healing and suppuration of the wound happens.\\nIt is treated with debridement of the socket and removal of any and every causative agent of the infection. This is the best and only way to go about it.\\nTemporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction after Tooth Extraction\\nIt may occur after wisdom tooth extraction. This tooth extraction complication is unusual and is temporary. To treat this condition, anti-inflammatory medicaments, heat therapy, rest and in some cases bite splint therapy is given.\\nFree Dental Consultation', 'Potential Causes of Nerve Damage During Dental Procedures\\nThere are several potential causes of nerve damage during dental procedures. One common cause is the improper administration of local anesthesia. If the dentist injects the anesthesia too close to a nerve or applies too much pressure, it can result in nerve damage. Another cause is excessive force during dental treatments, such as when extracting a tooth or performing a root canal. This can put pressure on the surrounding nerves and lead to damage.\\nIn some cases, nerve damage may also occur due to surgical errors during procedures such as dental implant placement or jaw surgery. If the dentist makes an incision in the wrong area or damages a nerve during the surgery, it can result in long-term nerve damage.\\nPotential causes of nerve damage during dental procedures:\\n- Improper administration of local anesthesia\\n- Excessive force during dental treatments\\n- Surgical errors during procedures\\nImproper administration of local anesthesia:\\nThis occurs when the dentist injects the anesthesia too close to a nerve or applies too much pressure, resulting in nerve damage.\\nExcessive force during dental treatments:\\nIf excessive force is applied during procedures such as tooth extraction or root canal treatment, it can put pressure on surrounding nerves and lead to damage.\\nSurgical errors during procedures:\\nMistakes made during surgical procedures like dental implant placement or jaw surgery can result in incisions made in the wrong area or nerves being damaged, leading to long-term nerve damage.\\nHow Common is Nerve Damage as a Result of Dental Treatments?\\nNerve damage as a result of dental treatments is relatively rare, but it can occur in certain situations. The most common cause of nerve damage during dental procedures is the accidental injury to the inferior alveolar nerve or lingual nerve, which are responsible for sensation in the lower jaw and tongue respectively. This can happen during procedures such as tooth extractions, dental implants, or root canal treatments.\\nWhile the overall incidence rate of nerve damage from dental procedures is low, it is important to note that certain factors can increase the risk. These include complex or invasive procedures, anatomical variations in nerve positioning, inexperienced dentists, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or compromised immune systems. It is crucial for dentists to be aware of these risks and take appropriate precautions to minimize the chances of nerve damage.\\nSymptoms and Signs of Nerve Damage After a Dental Procedure\\nRecognizing the symptoms and signs of nerve damage after a dental procedure is essential for early detection and prompt treatment. Common symptoms include numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, loss of taste or altered taste perception, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and persistent pain or discomfort.\\nIn some cases, patients may also experience muscle weakness or paralysis in the affected area. It is important to note that these symptoms may not appear immediately after the dental procedure but can develop over time. If any of these signs are present following a dental treatment, it is crucial to consult with a dentist or oral surgeon promptly for further evaluation and appropriate management.\\nPreventive Measures Dentists Can Take to Minimize the Risk of Nerve Damage\\nDentists have several preventive measures at their disposal to minimize the risk of nerve damage during dental treatments. Firstly, a thorough pre-operative assessment should be conducted to identify any anatomical variations or potential risk factors for nerve injury. This may involve the use of advanced imaging techniques such as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to visualize the nerves and surrounding structures.\\nDuring the procedure, dentists should exercise caution and precision, especially when performing invasive or complex treatments near nerve-rich areas. The use of magnification tools, such as dental loupes or surgical microscopes, can enhance visibility and aid in avoiding accidental nerve injury. Additionally, continuous communication with the patient during the procedure can help identify any discomfort or unusual sensations that may indicate potential nerve damage.\\nFurthermore, dentists should stay updated with the latest advancements in dental technology and techniques that aim to minimize the risk of nerve damage. By adhering to these preventive measures and maintaining a high standard of care, dentists can significantly reduce the occurrence of nerve damage during dental procedures.\\nTemporary or Permanent: Nerve Damage from Dental Procedures\\nNerve damage can occur during dental procedures, leading to temporary or permanent complications. Temporary nerve damage may cause numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area, which usually resolve on their own within a few weeks or months. However, in some cases, nerve damage can be permanent, resulting in chronic pain, loss of sensation, or difficulty performing everyday tasks such as eating or speaking.\\nIt is important to consult with a medical professional if you experience any symptoms of nerve damage after a dental procedure. They can assess the extent of the damage and provide appropriate treatment options. In some cases, additional procedures may be necessary to repair the damaged nerves and alleviate symptoms.\\nLegal Grounds for Suing a Dentist in Cases of Nerve Damage\\nIf you have suffered nerve damage as a result of a dental procedure, you may have legal grounds to sue your dentist for negligence. To establish a successful lawsuit, you must prove that the dentist breached their duty of care towards you and that this breach directly caused your nerve damage. This requires demonstrating that the dentist failed to meet the standard of care expected within the dental profession.\\nAn experienced personal injury attorney specializing in dental malpractice can help gather evidence such as expert testimonies and medical records to support your case. They will also guide you through the legal process and ensure your rights are protected throughout.\\nProving Responsibility: Did Your Dentist Cause Nerve Damage?\\nTo prove that your dentist caused your nerve damage, several factors need to be considered. First, it must be established that there was a doctor-patient relationship between you and the dentist at the time of the procedure. Second, it needs to be shown that the dentist acted negligently by deviating from accepted standards of care.\\nMedical Records and Expert Testimonies\\nObtaining your dental records is crucial in proving negligence. These records may contain important information about the procedure, any complications that occurred, and the steps taken by the dentist. Expert testimonies from other dental professionals can also provide valuable insights into whether the dentist\u2019s actions were negligent.\\nCausation and Damages\\nFurthermore, it is necessary to establish a direct link between the dentist\u2019s negligence and your nerve damage. This requires demonstrating that the nerve damage would not have occurred if proper care had been provided. Finally, you must provide evidence of the damages you have suffered as a result of the nerve damage, such as medical bills, lost wages, or pain and suffering.\\nTime Limitations for Filing a Lawsuit Against a Dentist for Nerve Damage\\nIt is important to be aware of the time limitations for filing a lawsuit against a dentist for nerve damage. These limitations vary depending on your jurisdiction and are typically outlined in state laws known as statutes of limitations. Failing to file within these timeframes may result in your case being dismissed.\\nTo ensure you meet all deadlines, it is advisable to consult with an attorney specializing in dental malpractice as soon as possible after discovering your nerve damage. They will guide you through the legal process and ensure all necessary paperwork is filed within the appropriate timeframe.\\nCompensation Sought in Lawsuits for Dental-Related Nerve Damage\\nIn lawsuits for dental-related nerve damage, various types of compensation can be sought depending on the specific circumstances of each case. These may include:\\n- Medical expenses: Reimbursement for past and future medical costs related to treating the nerve damage.\\n- Lost wages: Compensation for income lost due to the inability to work during recovery or ongoing treatment.\\n- Pain and suffering: Damages awarded for physical pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life caused by the nerve damage.\\n- Disability or disfigurement: Additional compensation may be sought if the nerve damage results in permanent disability or disfigurement.\\nAn experienced attorney will assess your case and determine the appropriate types of compensation to seek based on your specific circumstances.\\nAlternative Dispute Resolution Methods Before Pursuing a Lawsuit Against a Dentist\\nPrior to pursuing a lawsuit against a dentist for nerve damage, alternative dispute resolution methods can be explored. These methods aim to resolve conflicts outside of court and can potentially save time and money. Two common alternative dispute resolution methods are mediation and arbitration.\\nIn mediation, a neutral third party known as a mediator facilitates discussions between you and the dentist with the goal of reaching a mutually acceptable settlement. The mediator does not make decisions but helps facilitate communication and negotiation between both parties.\\nIn arbitration, an arbitrator is appointed to hear both sides of the case and make a binding decision. This process is similar to a trial but is typically less formal and more streamlined. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is final, meaning it cannot be appealed in court.\\nBefore considering alternative dispute resolution methods, it is advisable to consult with an attorney who can provide guidance on which approach may be most suitable for your specific situation.\\nIn conclusion, it is possible to sue a dentist for nerve damage depending on the circumstances and evidence of negligence.\\nCan nerve damage from dental work be repaired?\\nInjuries to nerves during routine dental and oral surgery procedures are uncommon but can be treated effectively with proper management. It is important to conduct a thorough examination in a timely manner to increase the likelihood of successful surgical repair.\\nWhat is the average settlement for nerve damage?\\nThe settlement amount for nerve damage claims can vary depending on the severity of your injuries, how they affect your daily life, and the financial losses you incur as a result. Generally, settlements for nerve damage claims fall within the range of $15,000 to $100,000, although your specific claim could be lower or higher than these figures.\\nHow common is nerve damage in dentistry?\\nIt is common for branches of the trigeminal nerve to be damaged during maxillofacial surgery and dental procedures. However, in most cases, the symptoms are temporary and patients typically regain sensation over time.\\nIs it hard to prove nerve damage?\\nDiagnosing nerve conditions can be challenging, and many patients suffer for years without understanding or finding effective relief from their muscle weakness or pain. Our specialists recognize that the underlying cause of a nerve condition is not always apparent and may require thorough investigation to uncover.\\nCan a doctor prove nerve damage?\\nA skin biopsy is a medical test that can assist doctors in determining if there is nerve damage that is causing a loss of sensation.\\nWhat happens if dentist hits a nerve?\\nIndications of Nerve Injury If you have experienced nerve damage after a dental treatment, you may encounter the following symptoms: loss of sensation or numbness in the gums, cheeks, jaw, face, or tongue; a tingling or pulling sensation in these regions.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"problem-solution","error":null,"n":2}

{"id":286,"question":"What is the relationship between social status, wealth distribution and economic growth, and how have political institutions responded to address growing inequality?","gold":"An emphasis on social status can negatively impact economic growth when it causes high-wealth but low-ability individuals to crowd out high-ability but low-wealth workers from growth-enhancing industries.

Strong economic growth made that dream a reality for many prior generations of Americans, including those who started out poor. But over the past three decades, the United States has experienced deteriorating economic growth and a long, slow rise in economic inequality. As a result, the fruits of economic growth have gone largely to the wealthy, median incomes have stagnated, and the poor have increasingly been left behind. In 2001, the Russell Sage Foundation together with the Carnegie Corporation of New York initiated a program of research on Social Inequality designed to examine the implications of rising economic inequality across many areas of social life.\\nThe Social Inequality program started out by examining the implications of rising economic inequality across many areas of social life \u2013 the well-being of families, the parental resources available to young children, the quality of education from preschool to college, the chances of finding secure and satisfying work, the quality of health care and health outcomes, and the effectiveness of participation in the democratic process. For each of these domains, the Foundation supported descriptive research that sought to establish whether those groups that have increasingly been left behind economically have also lost ground in other ways that limit their full participation in society and make it more difficult for their children to compete successfully with the children of the more advantaged. Does rising economic inequality, once underway, have social effects that tend to entrench and amplify economic differences?\\nThis first stage of research has been summarized in the authoritative volume, Social Inequality, published by the Foundation in 2004. In addition, a convenient chart book, which illustrates the project\u2019s principal research findings on inequality in accessible, graphic form, and more than 70 working papers produced by the project are available for public use on this site. Although these results resist simple summary, they tend to show large, persistent differences in the quality of the lives led by rich and poor. Some of these social differences have grown larger during the recent period of rising inequality; many have remained stable; but none has grown smaller unless specific public policies were aimed at reducing the disparities between rich and poor.\\nCross-National Research on the Intergenerational Transmission of Advantage\\nThe greater the disparity between a society\u2019s rich and poor the greater the inequality in the advantages enjoyed by their children. The United States, with the highest rate of inequality among advanced economies, has the lowest level of economic mobility from one generation to the next. But more surprisingly, perhaps, the United States has even less intergenerational mobility than its high level of inequality would predict. Other countries have shown more success at moderating the effects of inequality on mobility \u2013 possibly by making public investments in education, health, and family well-being that offset the private advantages of the wealthy. What can the United States learn from these other countries about how to provide children from disadvantaged backgrounds an equal chance in life? If some countries are doing a better job at equalizing opportunity, at what stage in individual development do the effects of public investments show up? Are early investments in child health and family well-being of primary importance, or are school systems that impact individuals at later stages more effective? These questions motivated RSF to support Cross-National Research on the Intergenerational Transmission of Advantage in 2009.\\nLed by John Ermisch of the University of Sussex, U.K, Markus J\u00e4ntti of Stockholm University, and Timothy Smeeding of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, thirty-eight researchers in ten countries conducted fourteen coordinated studies on how family resources are correlated with the development of mobility-relevant skills and how those relationships may differ over the life course and between countries. What is the relationship, for example, between parental socioeconomic status and children\u2019s cognitive skills? Do these relationships change as children enter and progress through school? The researchers find that inequality in mobility-relevant skills emerges early in childhood in all of the countries studied. The overall study has important longitudinal and cross-national components, allowing the researchers a deeper understanding of national policies that can limit the effects of inequality on mobility. Findings were briefly previewed in a Pew Economic Mobility Project fact sheet and a comprehensive edited volume, From Parents to Children: The Intergenerational Transmission of Advantage, was published in 2012.\\nIn recent years, the Foundation has turned to in-depth examinations of the key institutions the United States relies on to counteract market-driven inequality: public education and the democratic electoral system. We have been interested in how these institutions have performed during the recent run-up in economic inequality. Have the public schools been able to provide equal educational opportunities despite growing differences in family resources, neighborhood quality, and local job prospects? Has the political system effectively transferred resources from those who have benefited from rising inequality to those who have not? And, overall, how well have American institutions performed \u2013 compared to other countries \u2013 in moderating inequality and providing something like equal opportunity for all Americans?\\nSocial Inequality and Educational Disadvantage\\nIn today\u2019s economy, the economic rewards to graduating from college have never been higher. Between 1977 and 2007 the inflation-adjusted wages of college graduates grew by 25 percent, while the wages of high school graduates increased by only one percent, and those of high school dropouts fell by 13 percent. At the same time, growing income inequality has increased the gap between the resources rich and poor families have available to invest in their children\u2019s education. Not surprisingly, the gap in educational attainment between the rich and the poor has also increased significantly over the past thirty years \u2013 with potentially dire consequences for the future economic mobility of children from less-advantaged families.\\nIn 2008, the Russell Sage Foundation, in cooperation with the Lyle M. Spencer Foundation, initiated an ambitious group project, Social Inequality and Educational Disadvantage, to investigate the extent to which economic inequality may be undermining schools\u2019 effectiveness in providing all students with an equal chance to get ahead. Under the direction of Greg Duncan (University of California, Irvine) and Richard J. Murnane (Harvard University), the project has yielded 25 research papers that chart the dimensions of educational inequality in the United States and explore how school performance and educational achievement are affected by the social and economic conditions surrounding schools. Schools where many students perform below standards are often located in neighborhoods with substantial crime problems, higher residential turnover, and fewer job opportunities than their wealthier counterparts. The families of students in these schools are more likely to be headed by single parents, by parents with limited educational backgrounds, or parents whose native language is not English. As a result, these schools face higher rates of student turnover, greater problems in recruiting high-quality teachers, more difficulty in creating safe learning environments, greater demands for special education, and a greater need to provide instruction in English as a second language. Despite efforts to equalize financial expenditures per pupil, these schools are increasingly unable to deliver anything approximating an equal chance for a quality education.\\nThe project will produce two books exploring schools\u2019 efforts to provide equal educational opportunity for all students. The first book, edited by Duncan and Murnane, Whither Opportunity? Rising Inequality and the Uncertain Life Chances of Low-Income Children (2011), examines how factors such as family functioning, neighborhood conditions, and local labor markets impact schools\u2019 ability to improve the academic achievement and educational attainment of disadvantaged students. The second book, Restoring Opportunity: The Crisis of Inequality and the Challenge for American Education (Harvard Education Press, 2014), further documents this growing national problem and suggests new policies for reducing educational inequality.\\nAccording to influential theories of democracy, rising inequality should lead to a ground swell of popular support for legislation that taxes the rich and redistributes the proceeds to those below them on the economic ladder. But over the past 30 years, taxes on the rich have been slashed and social programs to aid the poor have been steadily rolled back. The nation\u2019s political system in principle allows the rich and poor an equal voice in establishing the rules under which people compete in the marketplace and in the investments we make in public programs to help offset market-driven inequality. But with a growing concentration of national income at the top, the wealthy may be able to exert more influence over the political process, over-riding the interests of poor and middle-income voters. If so, public policy may well end up favoring the economic interests of wealthier constituents, further entrenching economic inequality.\\nIn 2006, the Foundation issued a Request for Proposals as part of a new research initiative on the Politics of Inequality. This ongoing initiative is an effort to improve our understanding of how rising inequality has influenced the U.S. political process and the policies it has produced. The initiative is concerned with a wide range of questions: Have government policies become more or less effective in offsetting the market-driven inequality of the last thirty years? Have poor voters become disinterested in a political system that appears more attuned to the interests of the rich, or are they simply too hard pressed by work and family responsibilities to take the time to vote? Are the rich more influential because of the increasing importance of money to electoral success? If so, how exactly does money exert its influence on the legislative process?\\nA number of projects examining the intersection of politics and inequality have been completed and more are underway. Nolan McCarty Princeton University, Keith Poole of the University of Georgia, and Howard Rosenthal of New York University argue in their RSF-supported book Polarized America: The Dance of Ideology and Unequal Riches (MIT Press, 2007) that rising economic inequality in the U.S. has led to more extreme polarization between the nation\u2019s two political parties, with one party favoring the interests of the rich and the other the interests of the poor. As the parties square off in defense of vested interests at either end of the income distribution, gridlock ensues thus limiting the ability of the political system to pass legislation to counteract the social effects of rising inequality. Larry M. Bartels of Princeton University examines the political causes and consequences of the growing gap between rich and poor in Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age (co-published by RSF and Princeton University Press, 2008). Bartels demonstrates elected officials\u2019 tendency to be more responsive to the concerns of the rich and argues that increasing inequality is not simply the result of economic forces, but the product of policy choices in a political system dominated by the interests of the wealthy. In closely related work, Martin Gilens's 2012 book, Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America, co-published by Princeton University Press and the Russell Sage Foundation, has shown a high correlation between the political interests of high-income Americans and subsequent federal legislation.\\nBuilding on this initiative, sociologist Shamus Khan and political scientist Dorian Warren of Columbia University, together with thirteen other leading social scientists, have formed a Working Group on The Political Influence of Economic Elites to expand the research field of economic influence on political life by examining how economic elites have influenced the myriad ways politics is done and the relationship between these processes and inequality.

The young continue nursing until they are six to eight months old, at which point they are fully weaned.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:2de0fdc9-1c9b-4e34-91d1-e6ce7c29075c>']","texts":"['\u201cThe soul is the same in all living creatures, although the body of each is different\u201d\\nWith those outlandish tusks, these wonderful creatures were always destined to be the inspiration for all sorts of fabulous legends. There is no other mammal known to man who sports this headgear. Left alone with few natural predators, elusive and shy, the islanders have been in awe of the babirusa for centuries. In native legend, they are said to use their tusks to hang upside down from trees in the night and sleep. Some say they hook their tusks over low branches to support their heads whilst they sleep, while others say the males hang in the trees to spy on the females!\\nIndonesian people make demonic masks based on the bizarre appearance of this unique curly tusked pig. The Balinese Hindu-era Court of Justice pavilion and the \u201cfloating pavilion\u201d of Klungkung palace ruins are famous for the painted babirusa raksasa (grotesques) on the ceilings \u2013 the paintings depicting scenes of the horrors awaiting the profoundly immoral and wicked after death.\\nThey are only hunted locally for meat by non-Muslim communities. Muslim villagers do not hunt them because of their distant pig connection. \u201cPigs are haram \u2013 considered unclean, forbidden to eat or touch, and best avoided entirely\u201d. Actually, the hippopotamus connection is much stronger, but, nevertheless, the babirusa is still a pig.\\nBearing all this in mind, and the fact that they have such a lush forest home to forage in, albeit fast disappearing, you would think these shy and retiring creatures would have quite a decent chance of flourishing. But, no! They are very much under threat. Extensive illegal logging is destroying these ancient animals and their ancient forest home. Hunting is rife and they are in demand as zoo exhibits.\\nTogian babirusas are much larger than their cousins, the better-known north Sulawesi babirusa. They have a well-developed tail-tuft, and the upper canines of the male are relatively \u201cshort, slender, rotated forwards, and always converge\u201d. Babirusas can reach up to over three and a half feet in length and can weigh up to two hundred and twenty pounds. Males tend to be larger than females. They have grey to brown skin, sparsely covered with briskly hair, and long, thin legs. Their snouts are also thin and they have small ears. Tusks come in fours.\\nThe tusks can grow up to one foot in length, with the upper canines growing through the upper lip and arching towards the eyes. These tusks grow continuously throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime. If they are not worn down or snapped off they can pierce the skull. The upper tusks of females are of normal size, but, they can be absent altogether. Male babirusa sharpen their lower tusks on trees, but not so the upper curved ones. This may be one of the reasons these become so long and curly; they are simply left to grow. With the tusks sited as they are, barbirusa are unable to root under the dirt for food. Instead they use their hooves to dig for insects and their larva.\\nBabirusas have a superb senses of smell and hearing, both of which are gainfully employed to find food and avoid predators. They are also excellent swimmers and very fleet of foot. They can run as fast as the deer.\\nAnd, they absolutely love wallowing in the mud. Not only does this cool them off, and its fun, but it rids the babirusas of the parasites and insects which live on their skin.\\nThe breeding season ranges from January to August, after which there is a gestation period of one hundred and fifty-eight days. Normally, two piglets will be birthed. The little ones will not be weaned until they are six or eight months old, but their diet will have been enriched with solids, starting ten days after birth.\\nOnce thought to be a sub-species of the Babirusa (Babirusa), the Togian Islands Babirusa (Babyrousa togeanensis) is now recognised as a separate species.

{"id":409,"question":"How do personality variables and locus of control impact social behavior in educational contexts, and what intervention methods can help prevent bullying of students with disabilities?","gold":"Research indicates that individuals with an internal locus of control showed needs related to interpersonal closeness on behavioral measures, though this didn't consistently translate to actual closer physical distancing. For students with disabilities, who are three times more likely to experience bullying than their non-affected siblings, several intervention methods are recommended: implementing school-wide positive behavioral support programs, teaching specific response routines like STOP-WALK-TALK, creating peer advocacy groups, and establishing partnerships with families. The approach should be proactive, treating bullying as a behavior rather than a trait, while fostering a culture of kindness and respect through inclusive attitudes and universal educators who value individual differences.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:df41830e-650c-4b60-bd5a-1b58944f99c0>', '<urn:uuid:c325aa22-c85a-44e3-9cc0-159f436765e6>']","texts":"[\"An Investigation of a Simulated Spatial Technique as a Measure of Interpersonal Distancing Behavior\\nDue to ease of administration, many studies in the area of interpersonal distancing behavior have used simulated spatial measurement techniques. These have generally included manipulations of inanimate representations of people. They have often been assumed to be equivalent to behavioral measures of interpersonal distancing. The present investigation's major objectives were to determine the following: (1) extent to which a simulated spatial measure of interpersonal distancing is related to actual behavior; (2) whether interpersonal distancing can be understood in terms of a social learning model; (3) whether personality variables are related to a simulated spatial measure of interpersonal distancing; and (4) effects of sex differences and body orientation on interpersonal distancing.\\nSubjects, drawn from undergraduates enrolled in introductory psychology classes, were administered Rotter's Internality-Externality Scale. According to locus of control scores and sex, four groups were formed, male internals, male externals, female internals, and female externals. Subjects within each of those four groups were randomly assigned to either male or female confederate conditions, yielding the final eight groups (N=l0 for each group). Confederates were chosen so as to match as closely as possible the age and general appearance of the subject pool. All subjects were administered the Personal Research Form and were individually given two experimental tasks: (1) the simulated spatial measure in which they were asked to. place pairs of felt figures onto a board; (2) the behavioral measures in which unobtrusive measurements were taken of the distance they placed themselves from confederates at side and frontal body orientations. For subjects given same sex felt figures, on the simulated spatial measure, confederates in the behavioral measures were also of the same sex as the subjects. For subjects given mixed sex felt figures, the confederates were of the opposite sex.\\nThe results indicated that there is no significant relationship between the simulated and behavioral measures of interpersonal distancing. The findings also provide only partial support for the view that interpersonal distancing may be understood in terms of a social learning model. On the behavioral measure, subjects with an internal locus of control reflected needs related to a desire for interpersonal closeness, while subjects with an external locus of control did not. Internals demonstrated closer interpersonal distancing on the simulated measure than externals. However, on the behavioral measure, internals did not maintain closer distance to others than externals. There was only limited evidence supporting the hypothesis that subjects' responses on the simulated measure were related to personality variables. Distancing at the frontal-body orientation was significantly closer on both the simulated and behavioral measures than for the side-body orientation. On both the simulated and behavioral measures there were no statistically significant differences in interpersonal distancing between male and female subjects nor between male and female confederates. Mixed sex felt-figure pairs were placed closer together than same sex pairs. However, there was no significant interaction of sex of subject by sex of confederate on the behavioral measure.

{"id":554,"question":"Why are nuclear reactors particularly effective for thermal neutron imaging compared to other neutron sources?","gold":"Nuclear reactors are excellent sources of thermal neutrons because they produce neutrons with a wide range of energies and contain large volumes of moderator that slow the neutrons down. The moderator makes the neutrons more efficient at initiating new fissions. For example, while power-generating reactors produce 2000 to 3000 MW, smaller imaging reactors like the McClellan reactor produces 2 MW and can provide a flux of about 4 X 106 neutrons\/cm2\/s at the radiography plane, which is sufficient for high-resolution production-rate work.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:5ee3150c-2ba1-430e-98f4-a230d66db7a0>']","texts":"['In the short-wavelength world of matter waves -- past the UV portion of the spectrum and beyond x rays -- materials look very different and the rules of imaging are different than with photons. \"Neutrons show you things that x rays will never be able to,\" said Wade Richards of the Univ. of California\/Davis research nuclear reactor in Sacramento, CA (Figure 1).\\nFigure 1. Neutron radiograph of a flower corsage shows the method\\'s ability to image thin biological samples. Photo courtesy of Nray Services.\\nThe ways that neutrons interact with matter are very different from the way x rays interact with matter. X rays interact with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus of an atom. Neutrons interact with the nucleus itself. In general, x-ray attenuation increases as the atomic number of the target material increases; usually, the attenuation is greater for lower energy x rays. Some light elements (such as hydrogen, boron, and carbon) have high thermal neutron attenuation coefficients, while some heavier elements (such as lead) have relatively small attenuation coefficients. The methods can be used in a complementary fashion. And while the imaging materials are different, neutron radiography is similar to x-ray radiography: a beam of particles penetrates the target, and the shadow of the device is captured.\\nPatrick Doty, Senior Scientist at Sandia National Labs. (Albuquerque, NM) said that because the intensity of neutron scattering varies irregularly with atomic number and neutron energies vary over a large range (and thus a wide range of useful wavelengths), neutrons can probe the structure of matter over many scales of length.\\nNeutrons can be divided into several energy groups: cold, thermal, epi-thermal, fast, and relativistic. This article concentrates on thermal and fast neutrons. Thermal neutrons have energies of roughly 0.03 eV or less, whereas fast neutrons are 10 to 15 MeV. Fission reactors produce neutrons with a wide range of energies, but because most reactors also have large volumes of moderator (to slow the neutrons down so they will be more efficient at initiating new fissions), reactors are excellent sources of thermal neutrons.\\nBeams of fast neutrons can be generated indirectly from particle accelerators (which accelerate charged particles into a target that gives off neutrons). \"Fast neutrons are very highly penetrating,\" Doty said. \"You can tailor the energies to look at a material, or you can look at shielded things -- you can look through lead shielding.\" Radioisotopes such as californium and amerecium-beryllium can generate fast neutrons as well, although this is not generally used for radiography. Thermal neutrons from reactors\\nAt the McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center (MNRC) located just north of Sacramento, CA, Wade Richards, Tom Majchrowski and others use thermal neutrons from the small nuclear reactor for a variety of applications, including inspecting aircraft parts for corrosion.\\nThe MNRC is a small nuclear reactor: whereas a power-generating reactor produces 2000 to 3000 MW, the McClellan reactor produces 2 MW. In nuclear reactors, neutrons are generated by fission in uranium. One neutron hits a 235U and two neutrons emerge. The neutrons emerge isotropically, heading in all directions. To use the neutrons for imaging, part of the shielding (10-ft.-thick concrete walls outside the tank of water in which the uranium sits) is removed. Pipes lined with neutron-absorbing and -scattering materials remove the particles that are too far out of line, providing a collimated beam of neutrons to the imaging bays. The reactor provides a flux of about 4 X 106 neutrons\/cm2\/s at the radiography plane.\\nRichards said that in the 2D and 3D computer tomography neutron radiography systems in his facility, a converter screen uses gadolinium (which has a high cross-section for thermal neutrons), which emits beta particles when bombarded with neutrons, and the beta particles are caught by a fluorescing zinc sulfide material. Once the image has been converted to visible light, it can be captured on film or by a video camera sitting outside the neutron-beam axis. (Other converters can also be used, including lithium carbonate and plastic scintillators, depending on the application and neutron energies used.) A major application of neutron radiography at the reactor is for real-time imaging of military aircraft wings as a standard maintenance method to detect corrosion.\\nThe McClellan site is the only facility in the world equipped with a robot stage and a video-camera radiography system that allows real-time imaging of objects 34 ft. long by 12 ft. high and as heavy as 5000 pounds.\\nThere is always some concern about how much one can bombard the object before the nucleus becomes radioactive. For aluminum, Richards said there is a 2.5-minute decay time. \"Within 10 minutes, it\\'s all gone.\"\\nThermal neutron radiography\\nFigure 2. Neutron radiograph of a handgun shows a wide range of contrasts within a complex mechanical structure.\\nGlen MacGillivray at Nray Services (Petawawa, ON, Canada) described the complementary relationship between x-ray and neutron radiography: \"When one is looking for a flaw, the contrast between the flaw and the unflawed material is paramount. If the attenuation in the material is too large, then insufficient beam penetrates to allow inspection.\" For applications that require distinguishing materials that attenuate differently, usually one wants to find the higher attenuator within a bulk material of lower attenuation. \"So,\" MacGillivray said, \"finding lead in a paraffin block (or a needle in a haystack) would work for x rays while looking for paraffin in a lead block (or a straw in a needlestack) would work for neutrons.\"\\nIn addition to imaging corrosion in aircraft wings, neutron radiography\\'s ability to detect hydrogen and carbon yield other applications. Neutron computer tomography has been used to analyze flaws and misalignments in o-rings, which are used for sealing joints in rockets and other heavy machinery. The method allows researchers to look through the outer (usually metallic) materials to see how artifacts from the fabrication process sometimes put crimps into the rings when they are in place (work of this sort for NASA has been done at McClellan).\\nIn a similar way, neutron radiography can be used for viewing lubricants or other details of interest within a metal structure (Figure 2), or for looking at explosives contained within metals.\\n\"Thermal neutron radiography is limited to reactor-based sources for high-resolution production-rate work,\" MacGillivray said. Accelerator and isotopic sources of neutrons can be used for imaging, but with sacrifices in speed and\/or resolution. Images are obtained using a variety of techniques, including direct to film from gadolinium foil, indirect to film from activated foils of dysprosium (Dy, atomic number 66) or indium, to a CCD device from a scintillator, or to an imaging plate from a scintillator. \"Imaging speeds of several thousand frames per second have been obtained,\" MacGillivray said.\\nMacGillivray said the neutron flux required for imaging depends on the application. \"We have successfully used image-plane neutron fluxes ranging from 5 X 104 to 4 X 107 neutrons\/cm2\/s for film imaging,\" he said. MacGillivray will be presenting his invited paper, \"Imaging with neutrons: the other penetrating radiation,\" at the Penetrating Radiation Systems and Applications conference at SPIE\\'s Annual Meeting in July.\\nIn addition to the applications mentioned above, neutron radiography can be used with a contrast agent to look for residual ceramic core material inside jet engine turbine blades. Another application is an indirect method of inspecting nuclear fuel -- a very radioactive material that would, if inspected directly, fog the film.\\nFast neutron radiography\\nFigure 3. In addition to being gathered from nuclear reactors, neutrons can be generated by linear accelerators. This machine generates neutrons by accelerating protons into a beryllium target. The systems can generate from 108 to 1013 neutrons\/second. Photo courtesy of AccSys Technology.\\nBeams of fast neutrons, with energies from 10 to 15 MeV, offer different imaging capabilities than thermal neutrons. These energetic particles can be produced by linear accelerators.\\nRobert Hamm of AccSys Technology (Pleasanton, CA) said his company generates neutrons from linear accelerators by knocking an electron off a proton or deuteron (usually from hydrogen gas), accelerating the positively charged particle, then bombarding a target (usually beryllium). The target then emits secondary radiation (neutrons), mostly moving in the same direction as the ion beam. (Figure 3). \"Fast neutrons penetrate matter very easily,\" Hamm said.\\nFast neutron radiography can be used in prospecting for diamonds or other minerals, Hamm said. It also shows mineral inclusions in rocks. For this application, users shine two beams at the target, one after the other. One neutron beam is at a resonant energy for the mineral, the other is off-frequency. The difference between the images provides information about the interior of the rock.\\nMeanwhile, James Hall and others at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (Livermore, CA) produce fast neutrons using a \"DD source.\" This is a system in which a deuterium beam is accelerated to the desired energies and hits deuterium with a pressurized gas cell (at 2 to 3 atm). The interaction creates neutrons mostly going in the same direction as the incoming beam.\\nHall uses fast neutrons to penetrate steel, lead, or uranium. \"We can look at voids of a few cubic millimeters in size behind up to four inches of uranium,\" he said, \"and we can see it well.\"\\nHall wants to create a system that will fit into a small laboratory and can image cubic-millimeter-scale voids or other structural defects in heavily shielded thick materials. The system should also be able to acquire tomographic image data sets, allowing users to gain a 3D image of the object.\\nTo detect fast neutrons, Hall\\'s group is using a rigid 4-cm-thick plastic scintillator indirectly viewed by a single commercial CCD camera. A thin mirror made of front-surfaced-aluminized Pyrex glass reflects light from the scintillator to the camera, which is well out of the neutron beam path. The camera\\'s CCD is a cryogenically cooled thinned, back-illuminated 1024- X 1024-pixel CCD with an antireflective coating on its active area. The detector can be used for image integration times as long as an hour.\\nApplications include looking at thick objects not well penetrated by thermal neutrons. Hall\\'s group has imaged a 6-in.-thick uranium and polyethylene slab assembly (with features machined into the polyethylene). The group also imaged a set of nine conventional step wedges. The step wedges were fabricated from lead, Lucite\u00ae, mock high explosive, aluminum, beryllium, graphite, brass, polyethylene, and stainless steel. All were 0.5-in.-thick pieces with uniform steps ranging from 0.5 in. to 5 in. in width. All of steps in each of the materials within the detector\\'s field of view could be discerned in the final processed image. A series of other imaging experiments, including tomographic imaging, have also been performed.\\nYvonne Carts-Powell, based in Boston, MA, writes about optoelectronics and the Internet.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"causal","error":null,"n":1}

However, cultivation also disrupts microbiological activity and causes oxidation of organic matter. Its effect on soil organisms and organic matter has been likened to a fire through ploughed soil: cultivation causes a decline in organic matter, which can lead to a general loss of fertility, unless counteracted by actions such as using fertilisers and rotating crops or pastures to restore organic matter levels. Loss of organic matter often leads to soil structural problems, such as surface sealing and hard-setting. Excessive cultivation was widespread during the first half of the 20th century, and still remains a problem in some locations.\\nConservation agriculture is a set of soil management practices that minimise the disruption of the soil\u2019s structure, composition and biodiversity. During recent decades, techniques of conservation agriculture have been developed that emphasise retention of crop residues, appropriate rotations with legumes and reduced tillage, or even no tillage. In these systems, seed is drilled directly into the soil, minimising disturbance of soil structure and biota, oxidation of organic matter and the threat of erosion. Maintaining soil cover on sloping land is especially important to protect against erosive rainfall. These changes have a major influence on soil condition and trend. Although declines in uptake of conservation agriculture (e.g. direct drilling) have been reported (Darbas et al. 2013), in some jurisdictions the proportion of cropping land sown using no-till methods increased from 16 per cent in 1999 to 67 per cent in 2013.\\nContinuous dryland cropping increases run-off and causes erosion, and long-fallowing dryland cropping contributes to rising watertables. Irrigated agriculture also contributes to rising salinity levels, with run-off of sediments, nutrients and pesticides. Maintaining vegetation in riparian zones helps to reduce nutrient run-off, trap sediments and reduce erosion, particularly erosion due to summer rainfall (Darbas et al. 2013). There is also some data to suggest that wetlands have a role in sequestering nutrients from water, although this may involve accumulation in wetland soils, with the potential for remobilisation during flood events (McJannet et al. 2012).\\nConservation agriculture practices have the potential to improve crop yields while maintaining soil ecological health. The minimum-tillage and direct-drilling practices of conservation agriculture, which reduce water erosion through minimal disruption of soil, are widely practised across central and southern New South Wales, south-eastern South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania (Peterson et al. 2014). Nationally in 2014\u201315, the most common land cultivation practice for crops and pasture was \u2018zero or minimum till\u2019 (i.e. no cultivation apart from sowing). Of the pasture land cultivated, 2.3 million hectares received no cultivation apart from sowing, and, of the crop land cultivated, 12.4 million hectares received no cultivation apart from sowing. The use of 3 or more cultivations was the least reported cultivation practice in 2014\u201315 and had the largest decrease of all cultivation practices, falling by 31 per cent to 660,000 hectares since 2013\u201314 (ABS 2016c).\\nThe most common crop residue management practice reported in 2014\u201315 was for standing residue to be retained, which was undertaken on 7.4 million hectares of crops. This practice was followed by residue retained on the ground and residue grazed off, with each reported to be used on 4.8 million hectares of crops. There was a 16.7 per cent decrease in stubble being incorporated into the soil and a 3.5 per cent decrease in stubble being removed by hot burn in 2014\u201315 compared with 2013\u201314.\\nRates of adoption of conservation agriculture have decreased in the Queensland Murray\u2013Darling Basin catchments, in part as a result of reduced soil extension services, unclear profitability and, possibly, costs of practices. Similarly, although understanding of the farming practices that result in soil erosion and salinity is high in the New South Wales Murray\u2013Darling Basin, adoption of conservation agriculture is low and sometimes decreasing (Darbas et al. 2013).']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}

PAUL (12\/14\/2016) \u2014 Researchers at the University of Minnesota have made a major breakthrough that allows people to control a robotic arm using only their minds. The research has the potential to help millions of people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases.The study is published online today in Scientific Reports, a Nature research journal.\\n\u201cThis is the first time in the world that people can operate a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in a complex 3D environment using only their thoughts without a brain implant,\u201d said Bin He, a University of Minnesota biomedical engineering professor and lead researcher on the study. \u201cJust by imagining moving their arms, they were able to move the robotic arm.\u201d\\nThe noninvasive technique, called electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interface, records weak electrical activity of the subjects\u2019 brain through a specialized, high-tech EEG cap fitted with 64 electrodes and converts the \u201cthoughts\u201d into action by advanced signal processing and machine learning.\\nEight healthy human subjects completed the experimental sessions of the study wearing the EEG cap. Subjects gradually learned to imagine moving their own arms without actually moving them to control a robotic arm in 3D space. They started from learning to control a virtual cursor on computer screen and then learned to control a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in fixed locations on a table. Eventually, they were able to move the robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in random locations on a table and move objects from the table to a three-layer shelf by only thinking about these movements.\\nAll eight subjects could control a robotic arm to pick up objects in fixed locations with an average success rate above 80 percent and move objects from the table onto the shelf with an average success rate above 70 percent.\\n\u201cThis is exciting as all subjects accomplished the tasks using a completely noninvasive technique. We see a big potential for this research to help people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases to become more independent without a need for surgical implants,\u201d He said.\\nDr. Bin He, IEM director, Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Biomedical Engineering, and Medtronic-Bakken Endowed Chair for Engineering in Medicine, received the prestigious Academic Career Achievement Award from the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), one of the world\u2019s largest professional societies in bioengineering.

The study goes far beyond fun and games and has the potential to help people who are paralyzed or have neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThe study was published today in IOP Publishing\u2019s Journal of Neural Engineering. View a University of Minnesota video of the robot in action.\\nFive subjects (three female and two male) who took part in the study were each able to successfully control the four-blade flying robot, also known as a quadcopter, quickly and accurately for a sustained amount of time.\\n\u201cOur study shows that for the first time, humans are able to control the flight of flying robots using just their thoughts sensed from a noninvasive skull cap,\u201d said Bin He, lead author of the study and biomedical engineering professor in the University of Minnesota\u2019s College of Science and Engineering. \u201cIt works as good as invasive techniques used in the past.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s a staple of science fiction: people who can control objects with their minds.\\nAt the University of Minnesota, a new technology is turning that fiction into reality.\\nIn the lab of biomedical engineering professor Bin He, several young people have learned to use their thoughts to steer a flying robot around a gym, making it turn, rise, dip, and even sail through a ring.\\nThe technology, pioneered by He, may someday allow people robbed of speech and mobility by neurodegenerative diseases to regain function by controlling artificial limbs, wheelchairs, or other devices. And it\u2019s completely noninvasive: Brain waves (EEG) are picked up by the electrodes of an EEG cap on the scalp, not a chip implanted in the brain.\\nA report on the technology has been published in the Journal of Neural Engineering.\\n\u201cMy entire career is to push for noninvasive 3-D brain-computer interfaces, or BCI,\u201d says He, a faculty member in the College of Science and Engineering. \u201c[Researchers elsewhere] have used a chip implanted into the brain\u2019s motor cortex to drive movement of a cursor [across a screen] or a robotic arm. But here we have proof that a noninvasive BCI from a scalp EEG can do as well as an invasive chip.\u201d\\nA team of University of Minnesota biomedical engineers and researchers from Mayo Clinic published a groundbreaking study today that outlines how a new type of non-invasive brain scan taken immediately after a seizure gives additional insight into possible causes and treatments for epilepsy patients. The new findings could specifically benefit millions of people who are unable to control their epilepsy with medication.\\nThe research was published online today in Brain, a leading international journal of neurology.\\nThe study\u2019s findings include:\\nImportant data about brain function can be gathered through non-invasive methods, not only during a seizure, but immediately after a seizure.\\nThe frontal lobe of the brain is most involved in severe seizures.\\nSeizures in the temporal lobe are most common among adults. The new technique used in the study will help determine the side of the brain where the seizures originate.\\n\u201cThis is the first-ever study where new non-invasive methods were used to study patients after a seizure instead of during a seizure,\u201d said Bin He, a biomedical engineering professor in the University of Minnesota\u2019s College of Science and Engineering and senior author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s really a paradigm shift for research in epilepsy.\u201d\\nUniversity of Minnesota researchers will be featured in the Big Ten Network\u2019s debut of \u201cImpact the World,\u201d a powerful new original series that highlights the academic side of Big Ten universities. The debut program airs Tuesday, Jan. 10, at 8:30 p.m. CST and features the work of University of Minnesota biomedical engineering professor Bin He and his students in the College of Science and Engineering.\\nHe and his team are pioneering technology that allows immobilized or speechless individuals to control real objects with their minds. No other research group has designed a system that allows a person to move objects on a screen at will through 3-D space using noninvasive technology requiring nothing more than thought.\\nSeated before a computer screen, Elissa Gutterman does what once seemed impossible: She guides a helicopter through virtual 3-D space by the force of her thoughts.\\nWatching her move the helicopter is fun, but biomedical engineering professor Bin He has a serious purpose in mind. He hopes that someday his work on brain-computer interfaces will give some control over their environment to people who have only their minds with which to communicate. Stroke and paralysis survivors are among the potential beneficiaries.\\nThis is the first time, to He\u2019s knowledge, anyone has demonstrated a system that allows a person to continuously move objects on a screen at will through 3-D space using noninvasive technology. And the system\u2019s noninvasive character means it could have implications far beyond the hospital. It could possibly help people drive or navigate, or it may find a use in entertainment software.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"comparison","error":null,"n":2}

The Impact of AI in our Society\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives. From voice assistants to autonomous vehicles, AI technology has the potential to transform various industries and enhance efficiency. However, as AI continues to advance, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications associated with its development and utilization.\\nOne major concern is the potential bias embedded in AI algorithms. AI systems are often trained on large datasets that reflect the biases and prejudices present in society. This can lead to discrimination and unfair decision-making, as AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate existing social inequalities. It is essential for developers to address these biases and ensure that AI systems are designed to be inclusive and unbiased.\\nAdditionally, the impact of AI on the job market cannot be overlooked. As AI technology automates certain tasks, there is a risk of job displacement for many individuals. It is crucial to prioritize re-education and training programs to equip workers with the skills needed for the future job market. Ethical considerations should be given to the potential social and economic disruptions caused by AI.\\n2. Privacy and Data Protection\\nThe development of AI relies heavily on data, often collected from individuals. As AI systems gather and analyze vast amounts of personal information, it raises concerns about privacy and data protection. Stricter regulations should be implemented to safeguard individuals\u2019 data and ensure transparency in how it is collected, stored, and used.\\nFurthermore, AI systems that process personal data may generate new insights and predictions about individuals. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of personal information and the potential for discrimination. It is crucial for developers to prioritize privacy by design, implementing measures such as data encryption and anonymization to protect individuals\u2019 identities and prevent unauthorized access.\\n3. Responsible AI Development\\nResponsible AI development requires developers to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences of their creations. AI systems should be transparent, explainable, and accountable for their decisions. This means that developers must ensure that AI systems can provide clear explanations for their outcomes and that they can be held accountable in cases of unintended harm or errors.\\nAnother important aspect of responsible AI development is ensuring the safety and security of AI systems. With the increasing integration of AI into critical infrastructure such as healthcare and transportation, any vulnerabilities in AI systems can have severe consequences. Developers must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential attacks and unauthorized access.\\n4. Social Impact of AI\\nAI technology has the potential to shape our society in profound ways. It is essential to consider the ethical implications of AI in areas such as surveillance, weaponization, and autonomous decision-making. The use of AI in surveillance raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties, with the potential for mass surveillance and constant monitoring. Development and deployment of AI-powered weapons raise questions about the ethics of autonomous killing.\\nMoreover, the use of AI in decision-making processes, such as determining creditworthiness or criminal sentencing, raises concerns about transparency and fairness. It is crucial to ensure that AI systems do not contribute to bias or discrimination and that there is transparency in how decisions are made.\\n5. Collaboration and Ethical Guidelines\\nAddressing ethical considerations in AI development requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, ethicists, and technologists. It is important to establish ethical guidelines and frameworks to guide the development and deployment of AI systems. These guidelines should address issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy, and accountability.\\nFurthermore, collaboration between academia, industry, and government is crucial to ensure that AI development is aligned with societal values and needs. Ongoing dialogue and interdisciplinary research can help navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI and mitigate potential risks.

By looking at these smaller cohorts, the researchers were able to control for other factors likely to affect bone health, including smoking, weight, and alcohol intake.\\nBone Health Risks Linked to Oral Steroids\\nIn comparing 992 people with osteoporosis to 2,607 without, the individuals taking two to three oral steroid prescriptions in a 12-month period were about 1.34 times (34 percent) more likely to have osteoporosis than those not taking any oral steroids.\\nThe risk grew substantially for those who took nine or more prescriptions (adding up to cumulative doses of 2,500 milligrams [mg] or more of the drugs). These individuals were four times (400 percent) more likely to be diagnosed with osteoporosis compared with those who weren\u2019t prescribed these oral drugs.\\nThe scientists also looked at a subgroup of 1,663 who had fractures and compared them with 3,676 people who did not have fractures. Those on oral steroids were twice as likely to have had a fracture.\\nBone Health Risks Linked to Inhaled Steroids\\nInhaled steroid drug use also ratcheted up the risk of osteoporosis diagnosis compared with no steroid drug use, though it was not as heightened as for oral drugs.\\nAsthma patients given 11 or more prescriptions for inhaled steroids within 12 months were 1.6 times (60 percent) more likely to have osteoporosis and 1.31 times (31 percent) more likely to have had a fracture compared with those not prescribed these drugs.\\nIndividuals on inhaled steroids were 20 percent more likely to sustain a fragility fracture than those not taking inhaled steroids if their doses added up to more than 120 mg in a year.\\nThe researchers noted in the study that patients with asthma and both osteoporosis and fracture were more likely to smoke, had more comorbid illness, and were of a lower socioeconomic status compared with the individuals who served as the controls.\\nMany Are Not Taking Bone-Bolstering Supplements\\nApproximately half of patients taking oral steroid drugs and fewer than half of those taking inhaled steroids were prescribed bisphosphonates in the year leading up to a diagnosis of osteoporosis or fracture, according to the new data. The scientists called the low percentage of bisphosphonate use (which could help prevent a bone problem) disappointing.\\n\u201cBisphosphonates are the most effective bone protection therapy, and they are recommended for those people who are receiving long-term or high doses of [oral steroids],\u201d says Chalitsios.\\nIt\u2019s important to point out that the researchers looked at existing records of patients\u2019 steroid drug use and bone incidents. Because the data was observational, the analysis does not necessarily prove that the drug use did or didn\u2019t cause the bone problems \u2014 only that they were related.\\nThe study authors also highlight that inhalers can be difficult to use correctly, so actual doses taken may have been overestimated. The analysis also tracked prescriptions filled versus actual use, another way medication use may have been overestimated.\\nAlbert Rizzo, MD, the chief medical officer of the American Lung Association and the chief of the pulmonary and critical care medicine section at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Delaware, says it\u2019s difficult to get a grasp on what an average amount of cumulative inhaled steroid is over a year\u2019s time.\\n\u201cPatients are placed on varying doses, high to low \u2014 some take them once or twice daily, and compliance on that regimen is always an issue,\u201d Dr. Rizzo says. \u201cThere is also the fact that not all inhaled steroids represent the same molecule but a range of molecules that have slight differences in potency.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s important to note that people with asthma rely on inhaled steroids as a first-line emergency controller medicine when symptoms flare up. Those with more severe persistent asthma may take oral steroids to keep their condition under control. These drugs have an anti-inflammatory effect that can reduce inflammation and ease breathing.\\nFor many asthma patients, these drugs can be lifesavers, and Chalitsios and his colleagues stress that patients should continue taking these medications as prescribed despite potential side effects. \u201cPatients with asthma should not stop taking their inhalers. They save lives,\u201d Chalitsios says.\\nThe takeaway message here is that these risks should be better managed as part of standard asthma care, he says.\\nData Are a Wake-Up Call to Pay More Attention to Bone Health for Patients on Steroids\\nFor Rizzo, the article spotlights the fact that currently there are no set guidelines as to how often bone density tests should be done and when drugs like bisphosphonates should be taken.\\n\u201cI think an important aspect of that article is that it again raises awareness that osteoporosis and osteopenia [a condition of lower bone density] can be side effects of being on corticosteroids,\u201d he says.\\nInhaled steroids, which are delivered directly to the lungs, require smaller doses than oral steroids and tend to have fewer side effects, Rizzo says. But the new data suggest inhaled steroids can pose significant risks, too.\\n\u201cThe research is also a wake-up call to say let's monitor the bone density a little more frequently in this population, and have some better criteria about when to use drugs like this in patients,\u201d Rizzo says.\\nThat said, Rizzo was not surprised by the results, because previous research has already suggested that even inhaled steroids may lead to an imbalance in the body that causes bone loss and deterioration of bone architecture, and osteoporosis and osteopenia are certainly recognized adverse events from steroids.\\n\u201cThe point is we ought to be doing a better job in monitoring the situation with regard to bone resorption [a complex biological process that can result in shrinkage or loss of bone] and osteoporosis, especially in patients on long-term critical steroids,\u201d he says.\\nThe Bottom Line for People With Asthma: Continue Taking Prescribed Drugs \u2014 if You\u2019re on a Steroid, Consider Talking to Your Doc About Bone Health\\nThe message to clinicians prescribing these medications to people with asthma is to step down medication dose if symptoms and exacerbations are well managed. Doing so could make a difference in reducing the risk of these side effects.\\nIn the research, investigators lay out guidance for clinicians by stratifying bone health risk by dose, number of prescriptions, and type of oral corticosteroid and inhaled corticosteroid.\\nThe hope is that the data can help inform better bone protection guidelines for people with asthma, Chalitsios says.\"]","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"open-ended","error":null,"n":1}

Consider a uniform rod that pivots around one of its ends. For simplicity, let\u201ds assume that the rod is at rest. What effect, if any, would each of the four forces in the figure below have on the potential rotation of the rod?\\nThe Skinny on Torque\\nTorque isn\u201dt actually a force, but it acts like one. Think of torque as a turning force; it causes objects to rotate either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.\\nOur intuition tells us that F1, F2, and F3 would not cause the rod to rotate, but F4 would. What\u201ds different about F4? It has torque. Just like a force is a vector quantity that produces linear acceleration, a torque is a vector quantity that produces angular acceleration. A torque can be thought of as positive if it produces a counterclockwise rotation and negative if it produces a clockwise rotation. To find the net torque acting on an object, simply sum the torques exactly as you would forces.\\nThe torque of a force can be defined as follows. Let r be the distance from the pivot (axis of rotation) to the point of application of the force F, and let \u03b8 be the angle between vectors r and F.\\nThen the magnitude of the torque of F, denoted by \u03c4(tau), is defined as\\n\u03c4 = rF sin \u03b8.\\nIn the previous figure, the angle between the vectors r and F is \u03b8. Imagine sliding r over so that its initial point is the same as that of F.\\nThe angle between two vectors is the angle between them when they start at the same point.\\nHowever, we can use the supplementary angle \u03b8\u201d in place of \u03b8 in the definition of torque. This is because torque depends on sin \u03b8, and the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplement are always equal. Therefore, when figuring out torque, use whichever of these angles is most convenient.\\nLet\u201ds see if this mathematical definition of torque proves what we suspected about forces F1, F2, F3, and F4.\\nThe angle between r and F1 is 0, and \u03b8 = 0 tells us that sin \u03b8 = 0, so by the definition of torque, \u03c4 = 0 as well. The angle between r and F2 is 180\u00b0, and \u03b8 = 180\u00b0 gives us sin \u03b8 = 0, so \u03c4 = 0. For F3, r = 0 (because F3 acts at the pivot, so the distance from the pivot to the point of application ofF3 is zero); since r = 0, the torque is 0 as well. However, for F4, neither r nor sin \u03b8 is zero, so F4 has a nonzero torque. Of the four forces shown in that figure, only F4 has torque and would produce rotational acceleration.\\nThere\u201ds another way to determine the value of the torque. Of course, it gives the same result as the method given above, but this method is often easier to use. Look at the same object and force.\\nInstead of determining the distance from the pivot point to the point of application of the force, we will now determine the (perpendicular) distance from the pivot point to what\u201ds called the line of action of the force. This distance is the lever arm (or moment arm) of the force F relative to the pivot and is symbolized by l.\\nThe torque of F is defined as the product\\n\u03c4 = lF\\n(Just as the lever arm is sometimes called the moment arm, the torque is also called the moment of the force.) The fact that these two definitions of torque, \u03c4 = rFsin \u03b8 and \u03c4 = lF, are equivalent follows from the fact that l = r sin \u03b8.\\nSince l is the component of r that\u201ds perpendicular to F, it is also symbolized by r\u22a5 (\u201cr perp\u201d). So the definition of torque can be written as \u03c4 = r\u22a5F.\\nThese two equivalent definitions of torque make it clear that only the component of F that\u201ds perpendicular to r produces torque. The component of F that\u201ds parallel to r does not produce torque. Notice that \u03c4 = rFsin \u03b8 = rF\u22a5, where F\u22a5 (\u201cF perp\u201d) is the component of F that\u201ds perpendicular tor.\\nSo the definition of torque can also be written as \u03c4 = rF\u22a5.\\n9. A student pulls down with a force of 40 N on a rope that winds around a pulley of radius 5 cm.\\nWhat\u201ds the torque of this force?\\nHere\u201ds How to Crack It\\nSince the tension force, FT, is tangent to the pulley, it is perpendicular to the radius vector r at the point of contact.\\nTherefore, the torque produced by this tension force is\\n\u03c4 = rFT = (0.05 m)(40 N) = 2 N \u00d7 m\\n10. The cylinder below is free to rotate around its center. What is the net torque on the cylinder?\\nHere\u201ds How to Crack It\\nEach of the two forces produces a torque, but these torques oppose each other.

The reception of Buddhist psychological thought in the United States began primarily after the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, 1893, where writer and publisher Paul Carus was especially attracted by presentations of Zen Patriarch Shaku Soen. His main student, Suzuki Daisetsu Teitaro (usually known in the West as D. T. Suzuki), consequently moved to the United States to assist Carus in promoting and developing Buddhist thought in the West. Suzuki\\'s approach to Buddhism was focused on the psychological part of the religion. On the one hand, he portrayed Zen as a genuine Asian practice way for developing the hidden capacities of the mind. In this sense, he wanted to show the gap between Asian and Western thinking and challenge the self-centered Western psyche he detected. On the other hand, he was very interested in fostering a dialog between Eastern and Western psychologies and influenced by the main religious psychological thinkers of his time (especially William James). This dialog led to co-operations with famous psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, followed by the first classic works in this field (with Carl Gustav Jung and Erich Fromm); and finally to the Zen boom in the 1960s.\\nThough many statements of these early beginnings have been widely criticized in recent years, the importance of the dialog between Buddhism and psychology is not in question, contrarily it is growing and expanding. Critics mainly pointed to the interest based interpretations of the respective counterpart. As a consequence of constructive elements in exploring Buddhist and Western psychology--either through the eye of the Western scientific methodology, or the Asian religious background-- interpretations tended to be orientalist or occidentalist.\\nThe situation today is different, as Buddhism has become a subject of intense study and research, in both Asian and Western countries, and an integrated element of many Western cultures itself. Through global exchange, the presence of Asian teachers in the West has been rising and many Western Buddhists have begun to create their own teaching style and philosophy. Buddhism in the West nowadays is a mixture of attempts to present a wide range of textual sources and Buddhist teachings in their specific cultural contexts and original languages and attempts to create a new Buddhism--centered on the basic teachings of the Buddha--which can provide answers to contemporary pressing problems in a globalized world mainly ruled by Western capitalistic systems. Of course, either approach does not necessarily negate the other.\\nBearing this situation in mind, I want to describe three different approaches of how the relation between psychology \/ psychotherapy and Buddhism can be observed and worked with in practice. These approaches should not be understood as exclusive, rather as highly overlapping. My aim is to provide a sort of helping tool for, and brief overview of the current research in this interdisciplinary field.\\nThe first approach is to present and explore parts of Buddhist teachings as a psychology. As many teachers of different Buddhist traditions point out, Buddhism is not primarily a religion based on faith and worship, but a system, or an art to inquire into the human mind. It is difficult, or in many cases in fact impossible, to draw a clear line between the more \\'religious\\' parts--as rituals and daily structures in Buddhist settings--, and the more \\'psychological\\' parts--as meditation practice in all its different variations, as well as the teacher student relationship and the direct transmission of insight and knowledge. But, considering the common definition of modern psychology as a science of human experience and behavior, Buddhism provides psychological methods of analyzing human experience and inquiring into the potential and hidden capacities of the human mind. In this sense, many Buddhist scriptures are kinds of psychological instruction manuals which are pointing to the practical realization of their contents. In modern translations this direct connection and dependency between psychological method and practice is sometimes stated straight in the titles: for example, Caroline Rhys Davids depicts the Pali Dhammasangani (\\'Enumeration of Phenomena\\', the first book of the Abhidhammapitaka) as \\'A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics\\', and Stefan Anacker calls the Yogacara philosopher Vasubandhu a \\'Buddhist Psychological Doctor\\'.\\nThe main characteristic of this approach is the close connection to primary sources, and the hermeneutical work with these sources which are often also translated by the author itself. In this way, an insight into the Buddhist understanding of basic human processes of perception and apperception should become apprehensible. The Buddhist system provides a rich psychological anthropology which contains a general view of the human predicament. This is shared by all Buddhist traditions, in addition to many more or less big differences depending on tradition and lineage.\\nFrom the point of view of cultural studies, the psychology in Buddhist scriptures shows the dependency of systems of thought to the specific cultural and societal circumstances they are developing in. Buddhism as a psychological system is one example of how psychological knowledge is shaped within certain cultural fundamentals. In intercultural dialog with Western psychological approaches, this can be helpful in questioning tendencies to universal claims of how to research human experience and behavior. Both Western and Buddhist psychologies are entangled in their specific histories and cultural backgrounds. Hence, they are among many other indigenous systems of investigating and understanding human experience and behavior.\\nThe reception of foreign systems of thought can open new doors for dialog and co-operation. This is what has been happening concerning Buddhism and psychology since Buddhist teachers have arrived in Western societies. Currently, almost all streams of psychology and psychotherapy have noticed and reflected Buddhist psychological theory and many of them have integrated parts of the Buddhist teachings in their own theoretical and practical work. The second approach, therefore, is the integration of parts of the Buddhist teachings in already existing psychological or psychotherapeutic lines of thought.\\nWithin the last years, the integration of Buddhist mindfulness and acceptance techniques has been one of the most flourishing innovations in psychotherapy. A development worthy of note within the different schools of psychotherapy is the fact that not only psychotherapies with a traditionally close relation to eastern thought--as Gestalt therapy or transpersonal psychology--engage in dialog with Buddhist traditions, but also the most scientifically orientated behavior therapies have recently been influenced by Buddhist thought. Some even speak of a \\'spiritual turn\\' in behavior therapy. \"Technologies of acceptance\", as in Marsha Linehan\\'s Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan 1998, 23), mirror traditional Buddhist values and are partly drawn directly from Buddhist meditation techniques. Another emphasis, and core value in Buddhism and newer behavior therapies, is mindfulness, based on a non-judging experience in the present moment--examples include Jon Kabat-Zinn\\'s Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression (MBCT) by Segal, Williams, and Teasdale. A further approach within newer behavioral and cognitive interventions is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which does not have a direct connection to eastern philosophies (ACT is built on Relational Frame Theory (RFT)), but arrives at comparable assumptions. As in Buddhist mindfulness techniques, a non-judgmental acceptance of all parts of the present experience--especially thoughts connected with inner language--is emphasized. The intended shift should be a focus away from inner conditioned language and behavior shaped as a result of thoughts, to a commitment of following one\\'s own personal values, also (and in many situations especially) against inner thoughts and modes of reacting. As Hayes (2004, 652) puts it: \"The larger message thus is validating (trust your experience) and empowering (you can live a powerful life from here, without first winning a war with your own history).\"\\nAs in the case of ACT, sciences and Buddhism are meeting and informing each other in creating an expanded field for understanding reality. In the Mind and Life Conferences these topics are addressed in a dialog of world renowned scientists and Buddhist authorities, according to the principle of \"a mutually respectful working collaboration and research partnerships between modern science and Buddhism - two of the world\\'s most fruitful traditions for understanding the nature of reality and promoting human well-being\"--Mind and Life XVIII directs to \"The Self, Mental Causation and Free Will: Exchanges between Science and Buddhism on the Human Mind\" (Mind & Life Institute, http:\/\/www.mindandlife.org\/, 2008\/10\/08). That there is a prolific dialog for both sides can be observed by the statement of His Holiness the XIV. Dalai Lama that Buddhism must be open for change, if there are scientific results which clearly imply a modification of certain Buddhist attitudes.\\nWhile in the second approach Buddhism as a psychological system is integrated in Western psychological systems, the third approach which I will sketch briefly relates the other way around. This approach is especially connected with newer developments in Western Buddhism and the active integration of social science knowledge into the Buddhist system. Terms as Engaged Buddhism or New Buddhism refer to these innovative movements, even Post-Buddhism. In the words of Marilyn Evy (2005, 328):\\nWhat is new about New Buddhism, or Engaged Buddhism in the West is that core Buddhist values as compassion, interdependency, and loving kindness are taken in a literal way, without too close institutional affiliations and historical cultural constraints which have partly taken place in the development of Buddhism in Asian countries. One result of this modern view within Western Zen Buddhism is a focus on gender equality and critical reflections on a male-centered, traditionally grown hierarchical structure.\\nRecently, also systems of Buddhist psychotherapies have arisen, for instance David Brazier\\'s Zen Therapy, which are integrations of Western psychotherapeutic structures within a Buddhist method of assigning and dealing with psychological problems. Other ground-breaking movements in Western Buddhism are Buddhist chaplaincy programs which are intended to address current burning problems in the societal surroundings and the interdependent global connection of harmful developments. Areas as prison work, end of life care, or environmental protection are dealt with from a Buddhist standpoint in connection with sciences.\\nIn many cases, psychology is one of the most fitting Western systems to build a frame for dialog with newer developments in Buddhism, because Buddhism always sets off from individual experience which is in a deeper way seen as non-divided, non-dualistic, and connected with all phenomena. But only the individual itself can experience non-distinction--the modern scientific definition of psychology, as a science of experience and behavior of the individual, is therefore a link to Buddhism as a psychological and ethical system.\\nThe history of Buddhism is a history of reception in different cultures and societies, with integration in already existing cultural prerequisites. The transference from India to China, for example, was accompanied by an incorporation of present Chinese religions. What is particularly happening now in Western societies, is the active dialog and debate between Buddhism and sciences. From a psychological point of view, discussions might continue to open new ways of understanding the human mind and dealing with the individual potential to happiness and wellbeing. Buddhism as a psychological, and at the same time, ethical system can help to build a bridge to the collective, which, from a Buddhist point of view, is not divided from the individual, but intertwined in individual experience in the here and now.\\n* Many thanks to my friends at Upaya Institute and Zen Center for fruitful conversations - and especially to Beth Miller for proofreading and important suggestions.\\nAustin, James H. 1998.

Our DBMS tutorial is creating for learners as well as professionals.\\nWhat is Data?\\nData can be defined as the description of facts, concepts, or information in a distribute manner applicable for transmission, interpretation, or processing by the human or electronic device. Data is described with the help of characters like Alphabets (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9) or special characters (+, -, \/, *, <,>, =etc.)\\nWhat is Data Item (Field)?\\nA set of character which is used together to represent a specific data element, e.g., name of the student in a class is represented by the data item, say, NAME.\\nWhat is Record?\\nA record is a group of associated data elements, e.g., Payroll data for an employee include such data fields as name, age, qualification, sex, Basic Pay, DA, HRA, PF, etc.\\nWhat is Data File?\\nFile is a collection of related data, e.g., a payroll file might consist of the employee pay record for a company.\\nExample: Consider the STUDENT File.\\nWhat is Information?\\nIt is an organized or confidential record that has some significant value to the receiver.\\nData Processing defines manipulating the data (raw data) to make it more helpful.\\nData manipulation consists of such functions as classification, sorting, estimation & summarization.\\nCharacteristics of Information\\nFollowing are the characteristics of information are as follows:\\nInformation should be accurate. It defines that information should be free from errors & clear. Accuracy also defines that the information is free from bias. Wrong data given to management would output in wrong decisions. As the manager\u2019s decisions are based on the data provided in MIS documents, all managers require accurate information.\\nInformation is of value if it is supported to the user in the form. It is useful and best understood by him. For example, in a business enterprise, top management may require information on key matters in a summarized form and the operation managers in a detailed form.\\nIt defines the current utility of data in decision-making or problem-solving.\\nIt means that information should be made feasible when it is required for a specific purpose and not before and in any case, not after.\\nThe record which is given to a manager must be complete and should meet all his requirements. Incomplete data may output in wrong decisions and thus may prove expensive to the organization.\\nInformation must have a purpose at the time it is communicated to a person or machine, otherwise, it is simply data.\\nThe information should be reliable and externally forced relied upon indicated.\\nIt measures the closeness of the information to the purpose.\\nNeed of Information\\n- Information is useful for making decisions.\\n- Information helps managers in lowering the level of uncertainties where they have to make a choice among several available alternatives.\\n- The information helps the users in tackling problems relating to their respective functional areas.\\n- Information is used by top management to plan the objectives of the organization and to access whether the objectives are being met in practice.\\nWhat is Database?\\nA database is an organized group of associated data of an organization saved in a formatted way, which is shared by multiple users.\\nCharacteristics of Database\\nFollowing are the characteristics of the database are as follows:\\nA database framework permits several customers to get the database together. To answering different questions from different clients with the similar (base) data is an essential form of an information system. Such a concurrent requirement for data hike the economy of an organization.\\nStructured and Described Data\\nA significant characteristic of the database strategy is that the database application does not contain only the data but also the complete description and definition of these data. These definitions are general analysis about the extent, the architecture, the type, and the format of all data and the relationship among the data. This type of saved data is called a metadata (\u201cdata about data\u201d).\\nSeparation of Data and Applications\\nApplication program does not require any information about physical data like encoding, design, storage place, etc. It only directs with the administration framework for a database (DBMS), i.e., standardized interface with the support of a standardized language like SQL. The create of the data and the metadata is done by the DBMS. In this method, all the functions can be done isolated from the data. Therefore, database internal reorganizations or development of flexibility do not have any power on the application programming.\\nData integrity includes the assurance of the database from unauthorized access (confidentiality) and unauthorized changes.\\nA transaction is an array of actions which are done inside a database to deliver it from one consistent state to the new consistent state.\\nOne illustration of the transaction is the transmission of an amount of money from one bank account to other account. The debit of money from one account and the credit of it to another account develops together with the logical transaction. This transaction is also an atomic. The debit or credit alone will both get to an inconsistent state. After finishing the transaction (debit and credit), the innovations to both accounts develop into persistence, and the one who contribute the money now has less money on his bank account while the receiver now has a more significant amount.\\nData persistence defines that in a DBMS, all record is managed as long as it is not removed unusually. The life period of data needed to be decided directly or indirectly by the customer and must not be dependent on system characteristics. Furthermore, data, once saved in a database, must not be lost. Changes of the database which are done by the transaction are determined. When a transaction is done, even a system crash cannot put the data in danger.\\nEnroll Yorself in Live Training: DBMS Training']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"verification","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":482,"question":"why victoria line london highest pollution levels","gold":"The Victoria line has some of the worst pollution levels likely due to having no above ground stations and a poor ventilation system, which causes particles to build up and constantly recirculate within the tunnels and platforms.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:206b9ad3-4d67-4dd5-b844-fd8043dacf94>']","texts":"['The soot lined walls, the hazy platforms, the unbelievably high PM2.5 concentrations - how has the London Underground reached this point?\\nThe Metropolitan line was the first underground tube system in the world, opening in 1863. The age of the London Underground is a factor in why it is one of the most polluted tube systems globally, but age plays a small role in pollution differences between tube lines. To understand why, we must examine the sources of the pollution.\\nThere are 5 key sources of air pollution in the London Underground (1):\\nWear of the train (wearing of wheels and brakes)\\nNon-train sources (rail wear and rail grinding)\\nStation sources (escalators)\\nExternal sources (air being drawn into station via tunnels, station entrances and vent shafts)\\nAll of these sources produce little specks of pollution that sit and recirculate at tube stations (which is the soot you can see). These sources have different chemical compositions but due to the prevalence of steel in the underground system, iron accounts for most of the PM2.5 (2).\\nKey factors influencing pollution levels between London Underground lines\\nTrain model and surrounding equipment used\\nPassenger numbers and train frequency\\nDistance from above ground stations\\nPollution created varies by line due to differences in train model and surrounding equipment. Faster (3) and heavier (train weight and passenger numbers) tubes (4) increase PM production while creating finer particles. As tubes arrive at the station, heavy braking produces particles and the speed of the tube kicks up older particles sitting on the track and platform. On older and poorly ventilated lines, there would likely be more of these particles present at the track.\\nThe depth of the line is another factor, likely as deeper lines have less sufficient air flow causing particles to accumulate. However, research has shown that distance from an above ground station may be a more significant factor. The Victoria line is one of the worst for pollution, likely due to it not having any above ground stations and having a poor ventilation system, rather than simply being one of the deepest lines (1). Particles build up in the line and constantly recirculate within the tunnels and platforms.\\nSo how do TFL deal with this? There is a cleaning programme to remove pollution but (REF) highlights it is complex and slow (5). Ventilation is mostly driven by the movement of trains inducing airflow which draws outdoor air into the station. In deeper lines, there are ventilation fans and shafts in the tunnels which extract air (6). Additionally there are emissions vacuums which capture a portion of aerosols (2). There is also the cleaning of the platforms, tube rails and trains themselves to remove dust (7).\\nThe age and distance covered by the tube network make keeping it clean no easy feat. We are still at an early stage of understanding how the factors and influences in the two lists above impact each other. With a greater understanding, more ways to mitigate the pollution will likely come to light.\\n1) Smith, J. D., Barratt, B. M., Fuller, G. W., Kelly, F.

In present work, the author extends the MSG to study the buckling of structures such as stiffened and sandwich panels. Such structures are usually slender or flat and easily buckle under compressive loads or bending moments which may result in catastrophic failure.\\nBuckling studies of stiffened and sandwich panels are found to be scattered. Most of the existed theories employ unnecessary assumptions or only apply to certain types of structures. There are few unified approaches that are capable of studying the buckling of different kinds of structures altogether. The main improvements of current approach compared with other methods in the literature are avoiding unnecessary assumptions, the capability of predicting all possible buckling modes including the global and local buckling modes, and the potential in studying the buckling of various types of structures.\\nFor global buckling that features small local rotations, MSG mathematically decouples the 3D geometrical nonlinear problem into a linear constitutive modeling using structure genome (SG) and a geometrical nonlinear problem defined in a macroscopic structure. As a result, the original structures are simplified as macroscopic structures such as beams, plates or continua with effective properties, and the global buckling modes are predicted on macroscopic structures. For local buckling that features finite local rotations, Green strain is introduced into the MSG theory to achieve geometrically nonlinear constitutive modeling. Newton\u2019s method is used to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations for fluctuating functions. To find the bifurcated fluctuating functions, the fluctuating functions are then perturbed under the Bloch-periodic boundary conditions. The bifurcation is found when the tangent stiffness associated with the perturbed fluctuating functions becomes singular. Moreover, the arc-length method is introduced to solve the nonlinear equilibrium equations for post-local-buckling predictions because of its robustness. The imperfection is included in the form of geometrical imperfection by superimposing the scaled buckling modes in linear perturbation analysis on mesh.\\nExtensive validation case studies are carried out to assess the accuracy of the MSG theory in global buckling analysis and post-global-buckling analysis, and assess the accuracy of the extended MSG theory in local buckling and post-local-buckling analysis. Results using MSG theory and extended MSG theory in buckling analysis are compared with direct numerical solutions such as 3D FEA results and results in literature. Parametric studies are performed to reveal the relative influence of selective geometric parameters on buckling behaviors. The extended MSG theory is also compared with representative volume element (RVE) analysis with Bloch-periodic boundary conditions using commercial finite element packages such as Abaqus to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the present approach.\\n- Doctor of Philosophy\\n- Aeronautics and Astronautics\\n- West Lafayette\\nAdvisor\/Supervisor\/Committee ChairWenbin Yu\\nAdditional Committee Member 2Vikas Tomar\\nAdditional Committee Member 3Arun Prakash\\nAdditional Committee Member 4Tyler N.

These genetic changes increase a person's likelihood of developing cancer. Precision medicine offers a targeted approach to treatment by analyzing the tumor's genetic profile through genetic testing and biopsies. This allows doctors to identify specific mutations and recommend treatments that are more likely to work for each individual patient. Through molecular tumor boards, physicians and researchers can review cases and offer targeted treatment recommendations for various cancers including breast, colon, lung, and pancreatic cancer, among others.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:aab09745-8252-4b55-b4a5-177fbba10098>', '<urn:uuid:d7aa7657-5f45-4f39-a81f-9319721bc55e>']","texts":"['Hereditary cancer is caused by changes in certain genes. Genes are the instructions that our bodies use to grow and function, and this information is passed down from parents to children. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of cancer diagnoses are due to an inherited form of cancer. This means that 5 to 10 percent of people who receive a cancer diagnosis had a genetic factor that caused them to have a higher likelihood of developing the disease.\\nThe most common hereditary cancers include:\\n- Breast cancer\\n- Ovarian cancer\\n- Uterine cancer\\n- Colon cancer\\n- Pancreatic cancer\\nGenetic counseling is the first step in the genetic testing process. In a counseling session, you and a genetic counselor will discuss your family history, personal history with disease, symptoms you may be experiencing and other factors to assess possible health risks.\\n- Estimate your risks for certain diseases\\n- Estimate the risk of an inherited cancer in your family\\n- Discuss ways to screen for and prevent cancer based on your risks\\n- Review the pros and cons of genetic lab testing\\n- Decide if genetic testing is right for you, given your particular risks and concerns\\nOur team will also provide you with treatment options and resources to support you through your journey.\\nWhile we offer genetic counseling services for a wide variety of diseases and disorders, many people use our services to better understand their cancer risks. Through genetic counseling and testing services, we can help you assess your risk of inherited cancers and empower you to lower your risks or detect cancer at its earliest stages.\\nOne in three people develop cancer at some point in their lives, so chances are you or someone in your family has been affected. It\u2019s important to remember that while a family history of cancer doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll develop cancer yourself, it may increase your risk. Genetic counseling can help you determine if you\u2019re at a higher risk and if preventive and screening steps are right for you.\\nOur genetic counseling teams recognize the importance of giving you a clear picture of your risks for cancer and other genetic conditions. Below are a few locations close to you.\\nIf you or a close relative, such as a parent, child, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, grandparent of grandchild, have any of the following risk factors, a referral to a genetic counseling clinic may be right for you.\\nHereditary breast and ovarian cancer\\n- Invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed at or under age 50\\n- Two or more blood-related individuals with breast cancer\\n- Male breast cancer\\n- Ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer at any age\\n- Breast cancer and one or more other separate cancers\\n- Breast cancer and large head circumference (57 cm or larger for women, 59 cm or larger for men) and\/or mental retardation\/autism\\n- Breast cancer with Eastern European Jewish ancestry, or Hispanic\/Latino ancestry from Southern Colorado or northern New Mexico\\nCancers that accompany breast cancer in inherited syndromes include a second, new breast cancer; brain, thyroid, pancreatic and endometrial cancers; lymphoma\/leukemia; and adrenal cortical or choroid plexus carcinomas.\\nHereditary colorectal cancer\\n- Colorectal OR uterine cancer diagnosed under age 60\\n- Two or more separate colorectal cancers in the same person\\n- Three or more blood-related individuals with colorectal or uterine cancer\\n- Colorectal cancer or uterine cancer and a personal or family history of other cancers\\n- Ten or more cumulative gastrointestinal adenomas or hyperplastic polyps\\n- Hamartomas (non-cancerous growths), juvenile polyps or Peutz-Jeghers polyps\\n- Pathology of the colorectal tumor shows microsatellite instability or evidence of a mismatch repair defect\\nCancers\/tumors that accompany colorectal cancer in inherited syndromes include uterine, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreatic and urinary tract cancers, as well as brain tumors, sebaceous adenomas and keratoacanthomas.\\nOther hereditary cancer syndromes\\n- An identified inherited\/genetic syndrome\\n- An individual with bilateral or multiple primary cancers or brain tumors\\n- An individual diagnosed with cancer at an unusually young age\\n- Three or more blood-related family members with the same type of cancer\\n- Rare cancers, such as medullary thyroid cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma\\nGenetic counseling is the first step toward genetic testing. Information gathered during genetic counseling helps determine if genetic testing would be helpful in your situation.\\nGenetic counseling involves recording a detailed family history and using that information to estimate your risks, helping to determine if testing is right for you and which tests to perform. Genetic testing may require a blood draw or cell sample from inside your cheek that are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.\\nSome of the common questions asked in genetic counseling sessions include:\\n- Have your relatives had genetic testing?\\n- Which relatives have had cancer?\\n- How old were they when they developed cancer?\\n- What type of cancer(s) did they have?\\n- Where did the cancer start in their body?\\nYour test results, family history information and evaluation notes will only be released to someone if you sign a form stating that our office can release your information to that individual or office.\\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), and other laws help protect people who undergo genetic testing against health insurance discrimination and employment discrimination. .\\nSome inherited gene changes cause several medical complications. Genetic counseling and testing may determine if you\u2019re at risk for another type of medical complication or another type of cancer in the future.\\nWe can then take a proactive approach to your health, considering ways to prevent your risk of developing other conditions. Many people with potentially hereditary conditions seek genetic counseling and testing to help their relatives. If you already have a condition, the results of your genetic evaluation will tell you if there\u2019s reason for your relatives to be cautious as well.\\nMost insurance companies will cover the cost of a genetic test if it will improve a person\u2019s medical care and you have a reasonable chance of having a specific condition.\\nAt Centura Health, we attempt to bill insurance for the cost of genetic counseling appointments and verify insurance coverage prior to a scheduled appointment.\\nIndividuals whose insurance pays for genetic counseling will be responsible for any applicable co-pay. If you schedule a genetic counseling appointment, you should receive a call prior to your appointment to explain what your cost would be. (If you\u2019d like to see if genetic counseling would be a covered benefit, contact your insurance company and ask if they cover the CPT code 96040.)\\nBecause Medicare and some insurance companies are not yet paying for genetic counseling, Centura gives a discount to those who pay out of pocket for these services.. Depending on the length of the appointment, individuals who self-pay will be charged approximately $40 or $80. If you\u2019re not able to make these payments, Centura may be able to help.\\nGenetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes has advanced rapidly in the last few years. Expanded knowledge of genetics has also led to better insurance coverage and additional testing options that allow you to receive the testing needed to make informed choices about your health. Many former patients who pursued genetic testing previously have elected to undergo new testing that has provided new information. One such patient remarked after a cause of the cancer in her family was finally found, \u201cMy family has been looking for this explanation for 20 years.\u201d\\nIf you were seen for genetic counseling previously, even if you received normal test results, you may benefit from a follow-up appointment. If you declined genetic testing in the past because of cost, new options may allow you to receive testing at no or very little cost. If you already had genetic testing and the results were negative or uncertain, you may qualify for additional genetic testing. Personal and family history updates may also impact genetic testing options, as well as cancer risk estimates and screening options. We recommend contacting your genetic counselor every one to two years to update your family history and see if any additional genetic testing options are available to you.\\nBefore 2012, genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes was often done one gene or one syndrome at a time. Since 2012, technology has improved to be able to test many different genes at once. We now call these tests \u201cpanels\u201d since they analyze numerous genes of concern at one time. These panels have made genetic testing cheaper because now one test can be done instead of having to order multiple tests from different labs. Panels also allow us to test individuals for rare hereditary cancer syndromes that previously would not have been covered by insurance.\\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been the center of conversations surrounding hereditary breast cancer since the mid-1990s. BRCA1\/2 testing that was done before 2012 didn\u2019t always include comprehensive rearrangement testing (also called \u201cBART\u201d) so it\u2019s very possible that individuals who received normal BRCA1\/2 test results before 2012 could still have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation that was undetected at the time.\\nOther hereditary breast cancer genes\\nIn addition, many different genes have long been known to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Studies have now shown that individuals with mutations in these other genes also have an increased cancer risk. Testing for these additional genes is now available.\\nHereditary colorectal cancer\/Lynch syndrome\\nTesting for hereditary colorectal cancer has also seen great advances. The most frequently identified hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome is Lynch syndrome, which leads to an increased risk for colorectal, uterine and other cancers. Additional genes that cause Lynch syndrome have been identified and more comprehensive testing of these genes is now available. New causes of hereditary colorectal cancer also have been identified. Individuals who received Lynch syndrome testing in the past could still have a mutation that wasn\u2019t known at the time, or they may have a mutation linked to another hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome that wasn\u2019t tested.\\nOther hereditary cancers\\nFor people with other cancer types, we now have testing options that did not exist previously. For example, there are now panels available that check 19 genes for hereditary kidney cancer and 13 genes for hereditary pancreatic cancer.\\nIn summary, genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes has been significantly updated in recent years, and individuals may qualify for additional genetic testing even if they tested negative in the past.', 'Cancer at the genetic level\\nCancer begins when damage or changes (known as mutations) in a cell\u2019s DNA cause it to grow out of control. This eventually forms a tumor. There are many factors that can influences these cellular changes, including:\\n- Genetic traits you\u2019re born with\\n- Environmental influences\\n- Lifestyle differences\\nWhat we\u2019ve found in recent years is that the pattern of mutations in a tumor (known as a tumor profile or a mutation profile) influences how cancer grows and spreads. Two patients with the same type of cancer may have different tumor profiles. And two patients with different types of cancer may have similar tumor profiles.\\nHenry Ford\u2019s advances in precision medicine\\nOur journey to bring Precision Medicine and other advances to the Midwest region was introduced on June 29, 2016 by the White House as part of the Cancer Moonshot initiative. Steven N. Kalkanis, M.D., Henry Ford Cancer Institute medical director, joined Syapse, Henry Ford\u2019s new Precision Medicine partner, at the Moonshot summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss their mutual data sharing and Precision Medicine commitment. The program will fully roll out by August 2017.\\nCollaborating with Syapse brings the Cancer Moonshot\u2019s vision of improved care to the Midwest in a way that delivers treatment that is built around an individual \u2013 encompassing Henry Ford\u2019s new customer promise \u201cAll for you.\u201d This initiative is a huge step forward in cancer care, allowing us to bring highly advanced options to all our patients, at all cancer stages, where in many cases hope was not present. This initiative is supported by the Henry Ford Pathology Department, which has nationally recognized expertise in its integrated approach to disease-specific genomic testing.\\nHow does precision medicine work?\\nPrecision medicine targets cancer treatment based on a patient\u2019s tumor profile. We identify a patient\u2019s tumor profile with the help of genetic testing. You may need a biopsy (a test in which we take a small sample of a tumor for analysis) so we can identify your tumor profile.\\nOnce we identify your tumor profile, we look for specific mutations that indicate whether the cancer will respond well to a particular treatment. This lets our medical oncology team recommend treatments that are more likely to work -- and avoid treatments that are less likely to work.\\nCan precision medicine help me?\\nHenry Ford is working to implement \u201cmolecular tumor boards\u201d across multiple subspecialties. Molecular tumor boards will bring together physicians and researchers from multiple disease sites to harness the power of new molecular genetic information retrieved from an individual patient\u2019s tumor. The team will be able to review the case and offer precision medicine in the form of targeted treatment recommendations and expanded access to clinical trials. We currently examine tumor profiles for patients with all kinds of cancer, including:\\n- Brain cancer\\n- Breast cancer\\n- Colon cancer\\n- Lung cancer\\n- Pancreatic cancer\\n- Prostate cancer\\n- Rectal cancer\\n- Some forms of leukemia\\nWe also may evaluate tumor profiles for patients with other forms of cancer if they don\u2019t respond well to traditional treatments. And we continue to expand our use of precision medicine to improve cancer care for as many patients as possible.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"problem-solution","error":null,"n":2}

These buildings were originally conceived as houses but, because of their spectacular and modern design, have entered the realm of art and have inspired a great number of architects. The design of these houses is so exquisite and well executed that most of them have been classified as monuments and become museums. These houses do not just belong to the \u201cplaces to visit\u201d section in our bucket list, they are also places where we would like to live, at least for a while. And why not? Dreaming is free.\\nCasa Rietveld Schr\u00f6der\\nGerrit Rietveld 1924\\nThe Rietveld Schr\u00f6der house is one of the most iconic examples of the Dutch artistic movement De Stijl. This avant-garde movement postulated that architecture should be taken as an extension of painting, and favored abstract and pure forms against figurative ones. It is not by chance that this house is considered to be the architectural equivalent of a painting by Mondrian, one of the founders of the movement. One of the most radical aspects of its design is the architectural conception of space in the first floor, conceived as a single open plan space that could be transformed at will using a clever system of sliding panels. In 2000, the Rietveld Schr\u00f6der was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\\nLe Corbusier 1928-1931\\nThis Corbusier master piece is located in the Parisian suburb of Poissy and is acknowledged to be one of the first buildings designed in the International Style, a style that would become widely known from the 1930s onwards. The house was built using reinforced concrete and embodied the five architectural principles detailed by Le Corbusier in his famous manifesto, The Five Points of a New Architecture: structural load borne by columns or pilotis rather than supporting walls, roof garden, free ground plan due to lack of walls, horizontal windows along entire length, and free fa\u00e7ade. Villa Saboye was declared a National Monument in 1965 and now belongs to the French State.\\nFrank Lloyd Wright 1936-1939\\nFallingwater House, also known as the Kauffmann Residence, was a commission from businessman and philanthropist Edgard J. Kaufman to already sexagenarian Frank Lloyd Wright. The distinguished architect designed the house as a sublime example of the style that he termed \u201corganic architecture\u201d: buildings harmonizing with people and their environment and conceived as a projection of nature. Fallingwater House is a three-storey building with cantilevered terraces that \u201cfly\u201d over the running stream below, giving the impression that the house has been miraculously built over the water. Its sleek, sophisticated design and its seamless integration into an environment of great beauty make of it a work of art, one which the American Institute of Architects labelled \u201cthe best work of American Architecture of all time\u201d.\\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe 1945-1951\\nThis exquisite project by Mies van der Rohe is considered to be one of the paradigms of International Style. Subject of much controversy in the 50s, it was one of the first \u201cglass boxes\u201d to be used for housing and prior to the famous Glass House by Philip Johnson. The house is structured as a rectangular prism in which all the walls are made from glass and is supported by eight 1.5m iron columns that give it the appearance of being suspended above the water. Its clean lines and seeming simplicity perfectly achieve its designer\u2019s objective of building a house that is seamlessly integrated with its surroundings.\\nThe Glass House\\nPhilip Johnson 1945-1949\\nThe Glass House by Philip Johnson was built at the same time as House Fansworth, by Johnson\u2019s mentor and teacher Mies van der Rohe, but it shows a much more radical approach to modern architecture. The house is a glass prism framed within a very light steel structure that surrounds the single, open plan space that makes the interior.

5 study arms)\\n- Frequency of physical activity: median increase of 19.6% (IQI: 14.6% to 57.6%; 6 study arms)\\n- Aerobic capacity: median net increase in of 4.7% (IQI: 3.3% to 6.1%; 5 study arms)\\n- One study found that those who received more frequent support were more active than those who received less frequent support, although both highly structured and less formal support were equally effective.\\n- These interventions also improved participants\u2019 fitness levels, lowered their percentage of body fat, increased their knowledge about exercise, and improved their confidence in their ability to exercise.\\nSummary of Economic Evidence\\n- What type of social support and what medium works for whom?\\n- Do intensity and structure of the support make a difference?\\n- How does effect size vary by frequency of social interaction?\\n- Does the effect of these interventions vary by gender?\\nGeneral Research Issues\\nThe following outlines evidence gaps for reviews of these interventions to increase physical activity: Individually-Adapted Health Behavior Change Programs; Social Support Interventions in Community Settings; Family-Based Social Support; Enhanced School-Based Physical Education (archived); College-Based Physical Education and Health Education; Classroom-Based Health Education to Reduce TV Viewing and Video Game Playing; Community-Wide Campaigns; Mass Media Campaigns (archived); Classroom-Based Health Education Focused on Providing Information; Creation of or Enhanced Access to Places for Physical Activity Combined with Informational Outreach Activities.\\nSeveral crosscutting research issues about the effectiveness of all of the reviewed interventions remain.\\n- What behavioral changes that do not involve physical activity can be shown to be associated with changes in physical activity?\\n- For example, does a decrease in time spent watching television mean an increase in physical activity or will another sedentary activity be substituted?\\n- Does an increase in the use of public transportation mean an increase in physical activity or will users drive to the transit stop?\\n- Physical activity is difficult to measure consistently across studies and populations. Although several good measures have been developed, several issues remain to be addressed.\\n- Reliable and valid measures are needed for the spectrum of physical activity. Rationale: Current measures are better for vigorous activity than for moderate or light activity.\\n- Sedentary people are more likely to begin activity at a light level; this activity is often not captured by current measurement techniques.\\n- Increased consensus about \u201cbest measures\u201d for physical activity would help to increase comparability between studies and would facilitate assessment of effectiveness.\\n- Note: This is not intended to preclude researchers\u2019 latitude in choosing what aspects of physical activity to measure and to decide which measures are most appropriate for a particular study population. Perhaps a useful middle ground position would be the establishment of selected core measures that most researchers should use which could then be supplemented by additional measures. The duration of an intervention\u2019s effect was often difficult to determine.\\nEach recommended and strongly recommended intervention should be applicable in most relevant target populations and settings, assuming that appropriate attention is paid to tailoring. However, possible differences in the effectiveness of each intervention for specific subgroups of the population often could not be determined. Several questions about the applicability of these interventions in settings and populations other than those studied remain.\\n- Are there significant differences in the effectiveness of these interventions, based on the level or scale of an intervention?\\n- What are the effects of each intervention in various sociodemographic subgroups, such as age, gender, race, or ethnicity?\\nOther Positive or Negative Effects\\nThe studies included in this review did not report on other positive and negative effects of these interventions. Research on the following questions would be useful:\\n- Do informational approaches to increasing physical activity help to increase health knowledge? Is it necessary to increase knowledge or improve attitudes toward physical activity to increase physical activity levels?\\n- Do these approaches to increasing physical activity increase awareness of opportunities for and benefits of physical activity?\\n- What are the most effective ways to maintain physical activity levels after the initial behavior change has occurred?\\n- Are there other benefits from an intervention that might enhance its acceptability? For example, does increasing social support for physical activity carry over into an overall greater sense of community?\\n- Are there any key harms?\\n- Is anything known about whether or how approaches to physical activity could reduce potential harms (e.g., injuries or other problems associated with doing too much too fast)?\\nThe available economic data were limited. Therefore, considerable research is warranted on the following questions:\\n- What is the cost-effectiveness of each of these interventions?\\n- How can effectiveness in terms of health outcomes or quality-adjusted health outcomes be better measured, estimated, or modeled?\\n- How can the cost benefit of these programs be estimated?\\n- How do specific characteristics of each of these approaches contribute to economic efficiency?\\n- What combinations of components in multicomponent interventions are most cost-effective?\\nResearch questions generated in this review include the following:\\n- What are the physical or structural (environmental) barriers to implementing these interventions?\\n- What resource (time and money) constraints prevent or hinder the implementation of these interventions?\\n- In the typical intervention, volunteers were grouped to provide companionship and support to help each other reach self-selected activity goals. Study participants received phone calls from other participants and from study staff members to monitor progress and encourage them to continue their activities.\\n- Some studies involved formal discussion groups to address barriers to exercise and negative perceptions about activity.\\n- Studies were conducted in the United States (7 studies), Canada (1 study), and Australia (1 study).\\n- Studies were offered in community settings, including community centers and churches (6 studies), a worksite (1 study), and a university (2 studies).\\n- Six studies exclusively or primarily reported results for women, and three studies also included men in their study populations.\\n- Study populations for most studies were middle-aged; one study included women aged 18 years or older, and one study focused on women ages 50 to 65 years.\\n- Three studies restricted their populations to people who were sedentary at the beginning of the study; the rest included people at any initial level of activity.\\nTask Force on Community Services.

{"id":936,"question":"What is customer retention rate, and how can companies predict if customers might leave?","gold":"Customer retention rate measures the percentage of customers who continue doing business with a company rather than switching to competitors. It can be calculated using the formula that considers existing customers at the start, new customers acquired, and total customers at the end of a period. A higher retention rate indicates business success. As for predicting customer departures, companies can analyze customer lifecycle data and build predictive models. These models can examine factors like product usage patterns, particularly in the first 10 days, time spent per active day, number of features used, and total number of active users. Companies can use various modeling approaches like logistic regression or random forest to predict which customers might leave, allowing them to take preventive action.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:e8b88cd5-95c9-4450-aa75-79294391b8f1>', '<urn:uuid:88f5c05f-8a14-4bcb-b386-23b363275918>']","texts":"['Table of Content\\nIntroduction for customer relationship KPIs\\nCustomer retention and acquisition are two fierce grounds of enormous competition between business firms in the contemporary corporate world. An interesting fact cited by Semrush is that the probability of selling to an existing customer is around 50 percent more than selling to a new customer. This explains why businesses lay great emphasis on customer relationships and for that, they need to track their performance across customer service metrics. The key performance indicators that evaluate customer relationship management performance in the most comprehensive manner are listed below.\\nList of customer relationship KPIs with calculators\\n1. Customer Retention Rate\\nThe customer retention rate is a direct measure of the number of loyal customers a company is able to generate. Customer retention is the ability of the company to turn customers into repeat buyers such that the customers make repetitive purchases of the company products against switching to the competitors. In quantifiable terms, it is the percentage of a company\u2019s customers who stick with it because of factors like pricing, product, and customer service. The higher the customer retention rate the more thriving and successful a business will be.\\nCustomer Retention Rate as a KPI\\nCompanies integrate a number of customer retention strategies such as loyalty programs, loyalty programs, personalization, and many others. To gauge the success rate of the strategies for driving a high customer retention rate, it is an effective KPI. If the consumers feel connected to the company, the retention rate will increase.\\nHow to calculate Customer Retention Rate?\\nTo calculate the client retention rate, the following parameters are needed-\\n- Existing customers at the beginning of the time period taken into consideration (S)\\n- Total customers at the end of the time period (E)\\n- Newly acquired customers in the corresponding time period (N)\\nFurther, the client retention rate can be computed using the formula-\\nExisting customers at the beginning of a year (S)- 500\\nLost customers - 70\\nNew customers - 60 (N)\\nNumber of customers at the end of the year- 490 (E)\\nThe retention rate = 86 percent.\\nCustomer Retention Rate Calculator\\n2. Average Number of Referrals Per User\\nThe average number of referrals per user is the ratio of the total number of referrals extended by users or customers over the total number of users. A higher number of referrals per user is a positive measure for a company as it would imply a greater number of leads likely to be converted into sales. Customers refer other people for the products and services if they feel the product and the service is up to the mark and the company is not leaving any stone unturned.\\nAverage Number of Referrals as a KPI\\nCompanies around the globe focus on referrals as it is the easiest and cheapest way to increase revenue and customer base. According to marketing statistics, 80% of people trust referral advertisements. Thus, referrals are a game changer if implemented in the right way by a business. Various unique strategies for increasing referrals are used by business organizations. They offer benefits such as building relationships, excellent customer support, and many others in terms of success in customer service metrics. Thus, to measure the success of these strategies the companies can use the average number of referrals as a KPI.\\nHow to calculate the average number of referrals per user?\\nThe average number of referrals per user is yielded by the formula-\\n|Total number of referrals made by all users\/customers|\\n|Number of users|\\nThe total number of referrals - 2000\\nTotal users of the business- 400\\nThe average number of referrals per user will come = 5\\nAverage Number of Referrals Per User Calculator\\n3. Client Summit Attendance\\nClient summit attendance is the quantitative value of the number of customers or clients that attend client events organized by an organization. It is usually represented as a percentage of the targeted client attendance at a given event.\\nClient Summit Attendance as a KPI\\nClient Summit Attendance can be used as a KPI for a number of reasons as the companies invest heavily in making an event successful. The companies set up a target number of consumers that would attend the event and the average cost per attendee should be the least possible. So a number of strategies are implemented to increase the event strength and to measure the success of the event strategies Client Summit Attendance can act as a great measure.\\nHow to calculate client summit attendance?\\nThe client summit attendance is yielded by the following formula-\\n|Number of client attendees||x 100|\\n|Total number of clients invited|\\nTotal number of clients invited- 400\\nInvitees turning up for the event - 150\\nThe client summit attendance = 37.5 percent.\\nClient Summit Attendance Calculator\\n4. Customer Complaints\\nThe proportion of customer complaints is a KPI that gives a company a clear idea of the effectiveness of its innovations that are aimed at optimizing customer experiences. It compares the number of customer complaints before the incorporation of a specific innovation and the frequency of customer complaints after the implementation of the innovation. A value less than 1 implies that a given innovation has been successful in enhancing the customer experience.\\nCustomer Complaints as a KPI\\nIf a company is having trouble with the customer complaints pouring in and as a result, there is an exodus of customers, certain things need to be done before this turns into a disaster. There are a number of ways the companies can innovate in customer experience, that are aimed to reduce the number of complaints and earn greater customer loyalty. These ways can be deploying new technology, setting up new communication channels, and so on. All these innovations will cost the company and to make sure that the innovation is successful, customer complaints KPI must be implemented.\\nHow to measure the KPI related to customer complaints?\\nThe variance in customer complaints before and after the execution of an innovation is given by the formula-\\n|No. of customer complaints after innovation|\\n|No. of customer complaints before innovation|\\nCustomer complaints after innovation is implemented - 40\\nCustomer complaints before the implementation of innovation - 75\\nRate of customer complaints- 0.53\\nCustomer Complaints Calculator\\n5. Number of Social Media Followers\\nToday, social media has become an amazing platform for companies and consumer services. The number of social media followers gives an account of the number of people or users that are associated with a business through its social media handles on platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook. It depicts the magnitude of customer engagement and indulgence a brand has on social media platforms. To add, it facilitates a comparative analysis of the engagement rates in two consecutive periods.\\nNumber of Social Media Followers as a KPI\\nCompanies want organic growth and the best way to get organic traffic is to have a big chunk of consumers following your brand on social media platforms. There are a number of strategies to increase brand following and companies need to invest their time and money to acquire genuine followers. The success of these strategies is directly proportional to the increase in the number of brand followers and to measure the success of these activities, the \u201cNumber of Social Media Followers Ratio\u201d can be used as a highly relevant KPI.\\nHow to calculate the KPI related to the number of social media followers?\\nThe measure of the social media engagement of a brand is given by the formula-\\n|Increase in social media followers in current period|\\n|Increase in social media followers in last period|\\nThe total increase in social media followers in the current period - 600\\nThe total increase in the last period -450\\nThe rate of increase in social media followers in these periods = 1.33\\nNumber of Social Media Followers Calculator\\n6. Open Rate\\nOpen rate is a crucial measure that helps companies understand if their email campaign or email marketing strategies have worked well to engage and attract customers. It takes into account the No. of total emails sent by a company to customers or potential customers and the number of emails actually opened.\\nOpen Rate as a KPI\\nMost of the people in the world have a plethora of unopened emails, while companies spend a lot of effort in designing, drafting, and sending these emails. A number of strategies can be encompassed by the companies to increase open rate but in the case of email marketing, no fixed strategy can work for every company. Thus, companies need to implement a try and reject\/accept method to choose the best strategy. To know the outcome of a particular strategy, the open rate KPI is the best tool that will determine whether the strategy is an accepted one or a rejected one.\\nHow to calculate the open rate?\\nThe value of the open rate is yielded by the following formula-\\n|Number of emails opened|\\n|Total number of emails sent|\\nTotal number of emails sent to customers and potential clients - 1200\\nNumber of recipients who opened the emails- 800\\nOpen rate = 0.66\\nOpen Rate Calculator\\n7. Rate of Referrals Per Customer\\nThis key performance indicator quantifies the level of satisfaction that a company\u2019s customers have with its products and services, pricing, and the value offered to customers as part of their experience.\\nRate of Referrals Per Customer as a KPI\\nConsumer referral is one of the most worthwhile and effective customer acquisition strategies. As said above, a number of strategies are used to increase referrals, and to know the success rate of these strategies, the most effective way is to check whether there is an increase in referrals per customer or not.\\nHow to calculate the rate of referrals per customer?\\nThe rate of referrals per customer is computed using the following two formulas-\\n|1. Referrals per customer =||Total No. of referrals in a given period|\\n|Total No. of customers|\\n|2. Referrals in a given time period =||Total No. of referrals in a given period|\\n|Units of time in the given period|\\nThe total number of customer referrals over a period of time-1500\\nThe total number of customers in that period - 400\\nRate of referrals per customer = 3.75\\nRate of Referrals Per Customer Calculator\\n8. Number of Support Requests Per Product\\nThis key performance indicator quantifies the ease or difficulty that customers of a company experience in terms of using their products. A higher number of support requests per product will signify that customers are facing complex challenges in using a product while a lower number of support requests per product will depict ease of product use.\\nSupport Requests Per Product as a KPI\\nSupport requests need resources such as finance, time, human resources, and at the same time, there is a chance that there will be an increase in the customer attrition rate. Companies need to make the customer journey as easy as possible marked by positive experiences. In order to do that, companies can invest in a number of ideas such as product information videos, content clusters, customer self-service tools, and many more. To know the success of these measures, the number of customer support requests as a KPI can be highly beneficial.\\nHow to calculate the number of support requests per product?\\nThe following formula can be used to obtain the number of support requests per product-\\n|Total number of service requests|\\n|Total units of product sold|\\nThe number of service requests received by a company for a product - 2000\\nTotal number of units sold - 9000\\nNumber of support requests per product = 0.22\\nNumber of Support Requests Per Product Calculator\\n9. Number Of Customers Per Employee\\nThis KPI gives a quantifiable measure of the magnitude of workload per employee and also determines how many customers are assigned to each employee on average. In other words, it quantifies the availability of a company\u2019s employee bandwidth for each customer.\\nNumber Of Customers Per Employee as a KPI\\nHuman resource cost is a big factor in the total costs of the companies. Companies would like to use human resources as effectively as possible and at the same time would like to provide excellent service to the customers, such that an effective number of employees are employed to treat customers with ease. Employees sometimes need to put efforts to increase the number of customers they are serving and companies need to know if their customers are treated effectively by the employees or not. Both can be checked by knowing the number Of Customers Per Employee.\\nHow to calculate the number of customers per employee?\\nThe number of customers per employee is calculated by the formula-\\n|Number of customers that an organization is dealing with|\\n|Number of employees serving the spectrum of customers|\\nThe total number of customers served by a company - 220\\nThe strength of the workforce is- 80\\nThe value of customers per employee = 2.75\\nNumber Of Customers Per Employee', 'Most companies religiously monitor their churn rate. If they don\u2019t, they should.\\nAcquiring new customers is a costly investment, both of time and capital, so you naturally want to minimize the risk of new customers ending their relationship with you.\\nAs a lagging indicator, churn rate only lets you look at what has already transpired in your product, whether it\u2019s wistfully or disconcertingly. But, there are ways to analyze customer lifecycle data and build models to predict which of your new customers may be likely to churn.\\nAs the data scientist at Pendo I watch churn, closely. Our own product is meant to help our customers reduce churn, and so it\u2019s no surprise that we pay close attention to it within our own product. My particular focus these days is on predicting churn by looking at how our customers use our product.\\nEven if you don\u2019t have a data scientist on your team, here are some things that you can do to build better predictive models, and mount an attack on churn.\\n1. Start with Definitions\\nBased on your business and transaction model, the churn rate could be defined in different ways.\\nFor example, you might define it as the percentage of customers who never returned back to the app (or make a new purchase) after their first 60 days.\\nWhatever the case may be, after you\u2019ve defined exactly what churn means for you, the next step is to identify the length of time for which you have reliable comparable churn data. Does your churn rate in 2016 compare favorably to your churn rate in 2017? Did your pricing models change from one period to the other? Did your product significantly change from one period to the other?\\nEstablish your baseline, as this will be the starting point for your attack on churn.\\n2. Are You Tracking the Right Thing?\\nThe next step to battling churn is tracking and measuring data that are essential for predictive purposes. In our case, we aim to have our customers achieve value in the product as soon as they onboard, so we track time to value for key onboarding actions. We also track aggregate usage data in the product and map it along regular points in our customer\u2019s lifecycle.\\nHere are some questions that should help you figure out if you\u2019re tracking the right things:\\n- What are the steps in your customers\u2019 journey as they onboard, both within and outside of your product?\\n- Do you track how many users are active in these customer subscriptions at a regular cadence (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?\\n- Do you have well-defined monetary transactional data for your customers in their lifecycle?\\n- Do you have sufficient metadata on your customer that are relevant for your analysis (geography, company size, industry, user base, etc.)?\\n- Do you track their satisfaction with you (e.g., NPS, CSAT, poll responses) at critical points in their lifecycle (e.g., 90 days, 6 months, 12 months)?\\n- How do you aggregate support ticket data generated by these customers?\\n3. Churn Indicators\\nNow that you know what you\u2019re looking for, and you have all this data, you can identify the most significant indicators to use in a churn prediction model. Make sure to only consider relevant and non-redundant indicators, and don\u2019t overfit the model. You want new predictions to work with new input, so build with the future in mind!\\nIn our case, average time spent per active day, number of features used, total number of active users, and number of days logged in over the period of analysis were broad indicators of overall engagement in the product. We also considered more specific indicators, such as the number of core features used and time spent on specific groups of features or product actions.\\nYou may have your own ideas about what makes certain features your core, but don\u2019t forget to also listen to your users. Even a brand new user\u2019s first few days in your product can teach you a lot about what you should consider core. In our case, we\u2019ve learned that activity in the first 10 days can be a good predictor of how likely a user is to return to the app.\\n4. Choose Models Wisely\\nChurn prediction models (like most models) are only as good as the data going into them. There is no standard strategy for setting up a churn prediction model. Before deciding which model to use, it is important to meticulously asses which indicators you are going to incorporate into your model.\\nSimple overall statistics on these indicators can lead you to decide which set of models to test: what are the distributions of your indicators, and are there outliers? Can you describe their irregularity? What is the relationship between sets of features?\\nOne of the things we were particularly interested in was predicting account renewal based only on the first three months of product usage. Some approaches that we explored included logistic regression, random forest, clustering, k-nearest neighbors, and SVM. Optimizing based on the accuracy of the predictions with our validation datasets, we decided on a logistic regression model for predicting churn.\\n5. Pull on the Goggles: Experiment Time\\nOur inferences of churn probability are the most useful to us when we can experiment based on our learnings and measure the success of our experiments. Whatever model you end up using, you want to translate it into experiment as quickly as possible.\\nIn our analysis, we observed a significant difference in onboarding speed between those who churned and those who hadn\u2019t.\\nOnce we saw that it was experiment time. Our team started tailoring new onboarding strategies for any segments that the model flagged as at-risk for future renewal. When the time for renewal comes, different strategies are tested for how effective they were in altering the risk factor of those accounts \u2014 keep what\u2019s successful, lose what isn\u2019t and pivot.\\n6. User-friendly Models and Results\\nThe most sophisticated and accurate models are only as powerful as how accessible they are to their end users: those in the company who ultimately stand to learn and apply the insights from them.\\nMake sure you invest in gathering input from those in your organization who are closest to your customers (from the pre-sales to customer relationships) to ensure that you are thinking of the right model variables and that you have embraced the depth of your customers\u2019 product experiences.\\nGet Ahead of the Churn Curve\\nIf you\u2019re not super into data, some of these details may have made your eyes glaze over. But, churn affects everyone and should be everyone\u2019s concern. The good news is that even without a full-time data scientist, you can probably take some of these suggestions and implement them in your organization to build a predictive churn model that will produce some action items for different teams. Prioritizing the time to build one, thoughtfully, can help you get ahead of the churn curve.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"multi-aspect","error":null,"n":2}
{"id":203,"question":"I'm researching the intersection of plot structure and surprise in narrative theory. Could you explain how the classical concept of peripeteia relates to modern plot twist techniques?","gold":"Peripeteia, which is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, has evolved into various forms of plot twists in modern storytelling. In classical terms, it was defined as a change by which action veers to its opposite, following rules of probability or necessity, as seen in examples like Oedipus where a messenger's revelation produces the opposite of its intended effect. In contemporary narratives, this has expanded into multiple twist techniques, including surprise endings, false protagonists, and reversed chronologies. Modern works may combine peripeteia with other devices like unreliable narration, flashbacks, or red herrings to create complex narrative surprises. Unlike the classical deus ex machina device, both traditional peripeteia and modern plot twists must emerge naturally from the story's circumstances to be considered logical within the narrative framework.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:49922eeb-69ad-434a-8dc2-5786e579e0bd>', '<urn:uuid:5afa9e25-8345-4540-aa14-52ce94eae549>']","texts":"[\"Aristotle.

Thus in the Oedipus, the messenger comes to cheer Oedipus and free him from his alarms about his mother, but by revealing who he is, he produces the opposite effect. Again in the Lynceus, Lynceus is being led away to his death, and Danaus goes with him, meaning, to slay him; but the outcome of the preceding incidents is that Danaus is killed and Lynceus saved. Recognition, as the name indicates, is a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune. The best form of recognition is coincident with a Reversal of the Situation, as in the Oedipus. There are indeed other forms. Even inanimate things of the most trivial kind may in a sense be objects of recognition. Again, we may recognise or discover whether a person has done a thing or not. But the recognition which is most intimately connected with the plot and action is, as we have said, the recognition of persons. This recognition, combined, with Reversal, will produce either pity or fear; and actions producing these effects are those which, by our definition, Tragedy represents. Moreover, it is upon such situations that the issues of good or bad fortune will depend. Recognition, then, being between persons, it may happen that one person only is recognised by the other-when the latter is already known\u2014or it may be necessary that the recognition should be on both sides. Thus Iphigenia is revealed to Orestes by the sending of the letter; but another act of recognition is required to make Orestes known to Iphigenia.\\nTwo parts, then, of the Plot\u2014Reversal of the Situation and Recognition\u2014turn upon surprises. A third part is the Scene of Suffering. The Scene of Suffering is a destructive or painful action, such as death on the stage, bodily agony, wounds and the like.\", 'A plot twist is a radical change in the expected direction or outcome of the plot of a novel, film, television series, comic, video game, or other work of narrative. It is a common practice in narration used to keep the interest of an audience, usually surprising them with a revelation. Some \"twists\" are foreshadowed.\\nWhen a plot twist happens near the end of a story, especially if it changes one\\'s view of the preceding events, it is known as a surprise ending. Sometimes people use a plot twist to describe a sudden change of a situation in real life. It is often assumed that revealing the existence of a plot twist spoils a film or book, since the majority of the film\/book generally builds up to the plot twist; however, at least one study suggests otherwise.\\nA method used to undermine the expectations of the audience is the false protagonist. It involves presenting a character at the start of the film as the main character, but then disposing of this character, usually killing them \u2013 a device known as a red herring.\\n- 1 Early example\\n- 2 Surprise ending\\n- 3 References\\n- 4 See also\\nAn early example of the romance genre with multiple twists was the Arabian Nights tale \"The Three Apples\". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveal the murderer to be the investigator\\'s own slave.\\nMechanics of the twist ending\\n|This section needs additional citations for verification. (September 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)|\\nAnagnorisis, or discovery, is the protagonist\\'s sudden recognition of their own or another character\\'s true identity or nature. Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in Oedipus Rex: Oedipus kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play. The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a murder mystery was in \"The Three Apples\", a medieval Arabian Nights tale, where the protagonist Ja\\'far ibn Yahya discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.\\nIn M. Night Shyamalan\\'s 1999 film The Sixth Sense, a main character who believes he is alive, helping a boy to communicate with dead people, discovers that he is really dead. Similarly, another film to use it is the 2001 film The Others, in which a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of The Twilight Zone titled \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\", the protagonists discover at the climax that they were discarded toys in a donation bin. Another example is in Fight Club, when Edward Norton\\'s character realizes that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is his own multiple personality. A mental patient in the horror film The Ward reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is in fact unknown, as in Layer Cake or the eponymous assassins in V for Vendetta and The Day of the Jackal.\\nFlashback, or analepsis, is a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event. It is used to surprise the reader with previously unknown information that provides the answer to a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The Alfred Hitchcock film Marnie employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain\\'s past victims, as Sergio Leone did with Charles Bronson\\'s character in Once Upon a Time in the West or Frederick Forsyth\\'s The Odessa File. The TV series Boardwalk Empire and manga (twice made into a movie) Old Boy uses similar twists.\\nAn unreliable narrator twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text. This motif is often used within noir fiction and films, notably in the film The Usual Suspects. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, a novel that generated much controversy due to critics\\' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner. Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the Terry Gilliam film Brazil, Chuck Palahniuk\\'s Fight Club (and David Fincher\\'s film adaptation), Gene Wolfe\\'s novel Book of the New Sun, the second episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Premonition, Iain Pears\\'s An Instance of the Fingerpost, Shutter Island, and \\'The Hitchhiker\\' from More Horowitz Horror by Anthony Horowitz.\\nPeripeteia is a sudden reversal of the protagonist\\'s fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character\\'s circumstances. Unlike the deus ex machina device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be Agamemnon\\'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra in Aeschylus\\' The Oresteia or the inescapable situation Kate Hudson\\'s character finds herself in at the end of The Skeleton Key. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by The Twilight Zone, most effectively in the episode \"Time Enough at Last\" where Burgess Meredith\\'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton\\'s suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film The Game.\\nDeus ex machina\\nDeus ex machina is a Latin term meaning \"god out of the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot. In Ancient Greek theater, the \"deus ex machina\" (\\'\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2\\') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2\u2014mechanes), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god\\'s will. In its modern, figurative sense, the \"deus ex machina\" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see Mel Brooks\\' History of the World, Part I). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.\\nPoetic justice is a literary device in which virtue is ultimately rewarded or vice punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed. In modern literature, this device is often used to create an ironic twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his\/her own trap. For example, in C. S. Lewis\\' The Horse and His Boy, Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting \"The bolt of Tash falls from above,\" his hauberk catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in John Boyne\\'s The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, in which a concentration camp commander\\'s son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in Chris Van Allsburg\\'s picture book, The Sweetest Fig, where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog and ends up getting his comeuppance.\\nChekhov\\'s gun refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in Sweeney Todd. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character\\'s wife.  A similar mechanism is the \"plant\", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.\\nA red herring is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution. This device usually appears in detective novels and mystery fiction. The red herring is a type of misdirection, a device intended to distract the protagonist, and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film Gupt: The Hidden Truth cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code, the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). Agatha Christie\\'s classic And Then There Were None is another famous example, and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false foreshadowing.\\nIn medias res\\nIn medias res (Latin for \"into the middle of things\") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning. Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of flashbacks. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film The Prestige in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In Monsters, a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. In medias res is often used to provide a narrative hook.\\nA non-linear narrative works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order. This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in The Odyssey, a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator Odysseus. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films Mulholland Drive, Sin City, Premonition, Pulp Fiction, Memento, Babel, the television show Lost, the television show How I Met Your Mother (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), and the book Catch-22.\\nReverse chronology works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event. Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a \"twist ending.\" Examples employing this technique include the films Irr\u00e9versible, Memento, Happy End and 5x2, the play Betrayal by Harold Pinter, and Martin Amis\\' Time\\'s Arrow.\\n- Ralph Stuart Singleton; James A.

The body is divided into a broad, flattened, semicircular front part (the prosoma), a tapering middle part (the opisthosoma), and a pointed, spiky taillike part (the telson).\\nHorseshoe crabs have no jaws, and the mouth is flanked by a pair of pincerlike chelicera that are used to crush worms and other invertebrates taken as food. They have two compound, primary eyes and five simple, secondary eyes on top of the carapace, and two simple eyes near the mouth, under the carapace; additionally, the telson has photoreceptors. Five pairs of walking legs attached to the prosoma enable the animals to swim awkwardly or burrow through the sand or mud. They swim upside down, with the carapace forward and angled upward. The respiratory organs are called book gills and are unique to horseshoe crabs. Each book gill is made of about 100 thin leaves, or plates; these are fitted like pages of a book onto one pair of flaplike appendages on the opisthosoma. Rhythmic movement of the appendages circulates water over the gill surfaces and drives blood into and out of the gill leaves.\\nHorseshoe crabs first appeared in the Upper Silurian period, and a number of fossil species have been described. Four species still survive; three of these are found along the Pacific coast of Asia. The American species, Limulus polyphemus, is common along the Atlantic coast from Nova Scotia to Florida. It lives in shallow water, preferring soft or sandy bottoms, and reaches a maximum length of nearly 2 ft (61 cm).

In addition, salinity, current, and tide can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems. Find an answer to your question is salinity a biotic or abiotic factor? Available from: Petronia Carillo, Maria Grazia Annunziata, Giovanni Pontecorvo, Amodio Fuggi and Pasqualina Woodrow (September 22nd 2011). Abiotic and biotic factors work together to create a unique ecosystem. For example, abiotic factors found in aquatic systems may be things like water depth, pH, sunlight, turbidity (amount of water cloudiness), salinity (salt concentration), available nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. Explanation: A biotic factor is a living being which interact with the other living beings and the surrounding non-living physical environment.

Symbiosis - Is interaction between two different organisms living in close physical association, typically to the advantage of both organisms. Plants grown under field conditions face a combination of different separate or concurrent abiotic and biotic stresses and in response plants employ diverse set of genes to alleviate the devastating impact on growth and development. The abiotic stresses include salinity, cold, heat, drought, floods, heavy metals etc. Learn more about abiotic factors with this curated resource collection. van Zonneveld, M., Rakha, M., Tan, S.y.

Abiotic factors are the nonliving parts of the environment, such as air, minerals, temperature, and sunlight. Biotic and abiotic factors are the environmental conditions that the organisms have to face to live in a specified environment. What are the 5 abiotic factors in an ecosystem? Abiotic and biotic factors work together [\u00e2\u00a6] In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water. There was an extensive review on salinity effects in citrus (Levy and Syvertsen, 2004) but here we also elaborate on abiotic interactions between salinity and important pests, including root weevil larvae, root rot, mycorrhizae, nematodes and HLB. whereas, biotic stresses include attack by pathogens (bacterial, fungal, viral). 1. An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. Contact Us. Abiotic: It refers to the non-living components of an ecosystem, e.g. Is salinity a biotic or abiotic factor? air, soil, water, sunlight. It pertains to all non-living factors that can greatly affect the reproduction and survival of living things. Biotic factors are the living parts of the ecosystem, such as plants, animals, and bacteria. Key differences Biotic Factor Abiotic Factor; Meaning\/definition: It pertains to all living organisms that can be found in the ecosystem. Conversely, studies that focus on biotic interactions have rarely addressed the possible role of abiotic stressors such as salinity, freezing, and drought. Conclusion Biotic and abiotic are the two elements which build an ecosystem. These parts are referred to as biotic and abiotic factors. Answer: An ecosystem is an area that includes all the interconnected living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components. bacteria, fungus, viruses, insects, nematodes etc, but Abiotic stress causes by environmental factors such as drought, salinity, soil pH etc. Division Headquarters 315 N Racine Avenue, Suite 501 Chicago, IL 60607 +1 866-331-2435 Abiotic factors Abiotic factors are the physical and chemical conditions of an environment.

On the other hand, attacks of various pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, oomycetes, nematodes and herbivores are included in biotic stresses. In ecology, biotic and abiotic factors make up an ecosystem. Biology. 1. \u00e2\u00a2 Biotic (by-AHT-ihk) factors are living things, such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. Thus, there are only a few studies on salinity and biotic stresses from pests and diseases. However, in natural environments, plants may be simultaneously exposed to multiple biotic and abiotic factors that cause stress directly or indirectly. Salinity Stress and Salt Tolerance, Abiotic Stress in Plants - Mechanisms and Adaptations, Arun Shanker and B. Venkateswarlu, IntechOpen, DOI: 10.5772\/22331. In a marine ecosystem, abiotic factors would include salinity and ocean currents. An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. Several recent studies have shown that when biotic and abiotic conditions or stresses are combined (abiotic\u00e2biotic stress combination) the response of the plants is unique compared with each of the stresses applied individually (e.g. Abiotic: Water depth, sunlight, pH, turbidity, salinity, available nutrients, and dissolved oxygen are considered as abiotic factors. The Acorn or Bay Barnacle (Balanus improvisus), shown in figure 5 opposite, has one of the widest salinity tolerance ranges of any species.

First, they are made of softer rubber material than the main panels, providing better grip which allows players to impart greater thrust on the ball. Second, these pits help improve aerodynamic efficiency by increasing lift and reducing drag.

Different brands of match balls have slightly different pit patterns based on their specific designs.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:4c9c0f3d-b570-4ae9-bf34-086561277eeb>']","texts":"['Rugby balls, they\u2019re a funny old shape aren\u2019t they? And it all started with pig bladders made by William Gilbert and Richard Lindon for Rugby school. Today Stephen Phillips, our resident Engineer, takes a look at their history and in which areas balls can continue to improve.\\nThe first ever rugby balls were much rounder (see the above image from vintage rugby ball makers puntabout.co.uk) than the modern balls of today.\\nTheir first development was to add leather panels to the balls to provide a bit of wear resistance, next rubber bladders were used and the balls started to take on a more familiar shape of the modern ones of today.\\nHowever, there were still different variations that each union preferred.\\nAustralia and New Zealand preferred a narrower torpedo shape which produced less drag, leading to faster passing. The Springboks had their own 8 panel design for better grip and the 5 Nations had settled for a 4 panel design which is used today.\\nThe shape and size of the ball continued to change, mostly based on player feedback. But it wasn\u2019t until the 1980\u2019s when the next major change occurred: Leather panels began to be replaced by synthetic ones.\\nThe new materials allowed the balls to be made more cheaply, with better wear and water resistance. Grip pits were added to the surface of the ball to improve handling and aerodynamics, leading to the balls used today.\\nAs the ball passes through the air it experiences few basic forces. Thrust, in the form of the player throwing the ball in a particular direction. Lift, which keeps the ball in the air. Gravity which pulls the ball towards the ground and Drag, which slows the balls movement through the air. Pretty much the same as any airplane you\u2019ve ever flown on.\\nUnlike modern planes the shape of the ball can\u2019t be changed for efficient flight through the air, as World Rugby laws dictate the shape and size of the ball for rugby.\\nSo how do manufactures improve the passing performance of their balls? Well they can\u2019t do anything about gravity, as the weight of the ball is set.\\nBut they can do something about the other three forces.\\nRemember those grip pits mentioned earlier? They are made of a softer rubber material than the main panels, which allows for greater grip but just like F1 slick tires, they don\u2019t last long. Hence the reason why balls are so slippy at the end of the season.\\nThe greater the grip on a ball the greater thrust a player can impart on the ball.\\nThe pits also have another purpose; they help to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the ball by increasing lift and reducing drag.\\nManufacturers use CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) modelling to determine the best shape, size and location of each pit, to improve the aerodynamics of the ball. Next time you have two brands of match balls, take a closer look and you should see slightly different patterns.\\nWhile aerodynamics is very important for kicking it is also a lot more complex. Unlike a pass were the ball is usually spun in a straight line around the long axis with the narrow end pointing towards the direction of the receiver, a kicked ball often travels end over end and is dependent on where it was struck.\\nOne important feature of a ball, when kicking, is how much kinetic energy it can store and how quickly it can release it. From the video below you can see how the ball deforms when kicked by the player. The bigger the dent the greater the energy transferred to the ball from the player\u2019s kick.\\nThe quicker the ball returns to its original shape, the quicker that energy is released, allowing the ball to travel further and faster. This ability is dependent on what materials are used for the bladder and outer layers.\\nWhile a lot of the initial design and testing is done with computer modelling and laboratories, the true test of performance is when the ball is used in a game. Companies often use professional players and teams to test the ball before releasing to the public.\\nAs is explained above, there are only so many areas in which it can be improved so while the advances we\u2019ve seen to date have been significant, going forward we probably won\u2019t see things change too much.\\nAnd with that, what is your favorite rugby ball make?']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"causal","error":null,"n":1}

Instead, the field of international arbitration is didactically governed by self-policing, episodic, and distinct ad hoc measures serving to collectively safeguard the integrity of the international arbitration process. On the one hand, codifying best practices could improve the integrity, certainty and legitimacy of international arbitration, establishing a systemic set of ethical \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d. On the other hand, a standardized code may be confusing, aspirational and ineffective. What is clear, change is afoot, particularly in the field of ISDS.\\nThe Secretariats of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u201cICSID\u201d) and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\u201cUNCITRAL\u201d) recently issued a Draft Code of Conduct for Adjudicators of ISDS (\u201cDraft Code\u201d) on May 1, 2020, which was previously discussed by Professors Chiara Giorgetti and Vanina Sucharitkul on the blog. The Draft Code seeks to provide binding rules applicable to arbitrators, judges, and other ISDS adjudicators. As ICSID envisions, the Draft Code \u201chas the potential to memorialize a uniform set of ethical expectations for ISDS generally.\u201d UNCITRAL\u2019s Working Group III on ISDS Reform addressed the drafting of the code in its thirty-fifth, thirty-seventh, and thirty-eight sessions.\\nBut is a universal code of conduct for ISDS arbitrators actually needed? The integrity of the ISDS arbitrator is the subject of a diverse set of (hard and soft law) rules by different institutions and organizations. Applicable rules may include those of the administering institution, seat of the arbitration or as customized by the parties (e.g., IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest). Other leading arbitral institutions have already undergone similar changes to improve transparency and reduce conflicts of interest within the field. Such changes include the addition of Article 24 of the 2017 Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (\u201cSCC\u201d) requiring the tribunal secretary to remain impartial and independent; Article 27 of the 2017 Investment Arbitration Rules of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (\u201cCIETAC\u201d) requiring funding disclosures; and amendments to the 2017 Arbitration Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce\u2019s International Court of Arbitration (\u201cICC\u201d), which now authorize a party to request from the ICC reasons for its decisions including those made on challenges, consolidations, and jurisdiction. Even the proposed multilateral court for international investment arbitration envisions measures that eschew conflicts of interest. Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the European Union\u2019s submission to the UNCITRAL Working Group III on \u201cEstablishing a standing mechanism for the settlement of international investment disputes\u201d of 18 January 2019 provides that \u201cAdjudicators would be subject to strict ethical requirements\u201d and that \u201c[i]ndependence from governments would be ensured through a long-term non-renewable term of office.\u201d Despite these changes, the rules are meant to offer baseline protections and where apparent deficiencies persist, the arbitration process invites the parties to tailor-make their archetypal neutral.\\nSimilarly, the standard of review, which is the ultimate stress-test on disclosure obligations, also varies. For example, a successful application for disqualification of an arbitrator under ICSID Convention Article 57 requires demonstration of a \u201cmanifest lack of qualities\u201d whereas only \u201cjustifiable doubts\u201d are prescribed by UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules Article 12. For a discussion on other standards, please see blog posts by Gary Born and Chiara Giorgetti. Regardless of the variation, it is generally accepted that the standard to disqualify an arbitrator is remarkably high. The typical prerequisites of \u201chigh moral character\u201d, \u201crecognized competence\u201d, and \u201cindependent judgment\u201d are benchmarked against difficult tests that are rarely impaired. For example, only five of seventy-six publicly-listed arbitrator challenges under the ICSID Convention have been upheld. Generally speaking, the party alleging the challenge must demonstrate \u201cmanifest\u201d, \u201cactual\u201d, \u201cself-evident\u201d, \u201cclear\u201d, \u201cplain\u201d, \u201cevident\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d appearance of bias, \u201cjustifiable\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d doubts\u201d or, in some cases, a \u201cperception of bias\u201d. Accordingly, the current system is a patchwork, which invites ambiguity as ISDS stakeholders must evaluate the import of (each of) the (sometimes various) applicable law(s); but, if there is a convergence of outcome, does the difference in source and language even matter?\\nA significant exception, however, is the recent annulment of the Eiser v Spain Award on June 11, 2020, which is understood to be the first time in ICSID\u2019s history that an award has been annulled on the basis of an arbitrator\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality. In that case, one of the arbitrators, Stanimir Alexandrov, failure to disclose a longstanding professional relationship with one of the Claimant\u2019s expert witnesses from the Brattle Group led to the annulment of the \u20ac128 million award. While this annulment may be considered an outlier, it fans the flame that change is warranted.\\nAssuming, arguendo, deficiency in the current schemes of ethical rules and standards of review, each case ultimately boils down to its unique facts and the recent rule revisions by leading arbitral institutions are telling. Namely, certain apprehensions towards the role of the ISDS arbitrator have polarized amongst ISDS stakeholders; and pre-existing rules have been largely deemed by the international arbitration community as ineffective or unresponsive. Answers, however, are not easily found. Instead, solutions develop over time and have required regular updating. For example, in the last eleven years the ICC (2012, 2017), SCC (2010, 2017) and CIETAC (2009, 2015) have all updated their arbitration rules twice. ICSID is working on its fourth amendment (1984, 2003, 2006), which is addressing hotly debated matters such as double-hatting and third-party funding by offering clearer guidelines. Efforts against double hatting have also seeped into treaty drafting practice. The investment chapter of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which came into force on 1 July 2020, forbids arbitrators from acting in another capacity (i.e., as counsel, party-appointed expert or witness) in any other pending arbitration under the Agreement. Moreover, there will inevitably be new considerations in the future, such as developing standardized practices to deal with cybersecurity concerns flowing from confidentiality and the digital exchange of information (see e.g., Don\u2019t be the Weakest Link) or how to address the independence and impartiality of the underlying predictive software of artificial intelligence used to aid the arbitration process (see e.g., Arbitrator Intelligence). In other words, the ISDS world is dynamic and nimbleness to change is its guidepost. A code of conduct that does not reflect this inherent need for flexibility may in the end stunt the development of best practices.\\nSo, can it be achieved? The ICSID\/UNCITRAL Draft Code suggests that it can be; but, questions remain. The Draft Code is currently open to comment but will it receive the input and attention that is necessary? Rounds of revision will undoubtedly mete out problem language in the text as well as problem articles. For example, draft Article 6 imposes a complete ban on double-hatting, which will have serious repercussions for who is eligible to act as an ISDS adjudicator under the Draft Code. More specifically, women, minorities, and, more generally, young professionals seeking to establish themselves as an authority within the field will be largely disadvantaged. Young, hungry, motivated individuals equipped with great budding legal minds will be forced into silos: academic, practitioner OR adjudicator, with the latter a near (financially) impracticable choice. A similar criticism may be levied at the onerous disclosure obligations. Draft Article 5(2)(d) requires prospective arbitrators to disclose a list of all publications and public speeches made by the adjudicator or candidate. The first question is whether this is even practicable, particularly in light of the illustrious careers of certain arbitrators (and given the ban against double-hatting naturally precludes younger candidates); but it also follows whether, as a natural implication, it will lead to a \u201cscholarship chill\u201d, whereby those pining for an arbitrator\u2019s seat refrain from championing provocative argumentation and ideas because they prefer to safeguard a prospective \u201ccall up\u201d to the big leagues as ISDS adjudicator over simply being regarded as a novel thinker of the minors. Are we also ready for a binding code? Is it even necessary in light of the stringent challenge standards discussed above? Or, will it even have the desired effect given that the archetypical arbitrator under the Draft Code will likely be an ex-government official or retired judge, who may have already procured diplomatic immunity. For those without such privilege, it will likely increase adjudicator insurance premiums, which may translate, over time, into higher arbitrator fees.\\nWhile finding answers to these questions will be challenging and debating the details a laborious process, the trending way forward for ISDS is to backstop proposed reforms against legitimacy and integrity improvement efforts. The tandem effort by ICSID and UNCITRAL in preparing the Draft Code is step in the right direction. Certainly, reforms that enhance and safeguard ISDS arbitrators\u2019 independence and impartiality ought to be encouraged and embraced; but, the bottom line of any code of conduct for ISDS arbitrators will be towed by its practical utility. Accordingly, the scale of its success will be marked by its use in ISDS.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"causal","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":745,"question":"How does the allergy shot immunotherapy process work step by step?","gold":"Allergy shots immunotherapy works through two main phases: First, the build-up phase, which takes up to 12 months and involves injecting gradually increasing amounts of specific allergens to build tolerance. Then comes the maintenance phase, lasting 3-5 additional years to maintain the body's defense. The shots are administered in an immunologist's office, where patients must stay for 30 minutes after injection to monitor for reactions. For example, someone allergic to flower pollen would receive shots containing increasing amounts of pollen. Some clinics now offer rush immunotherapy, which involves 9-10 shots per visit to shorten the overall therapy time.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:d9d0d384-eeab-4881-b276-e91f23556914>']","texts":"['When spring and autumn comes around, it also means the arrival of the uncomfortably familiar itchy, watery eyes accompanied by never ending sneezes and itchy skin. If you are tired of constantly popping anti-allergy pills, finding an alternative immunotherapy treatment may be an option for you. Read on for information about allergy shots for seasonal allergy relief.\\nWhat Are Allergy Shots?\\nConsidered one of the most effective immunotherapy treatments towards allergy relief, allergy shots can effectively condition a person\u2019s body to become immune to what it used to react to. The therapy helps ward off allergies by injecting the body with controlled, gradually increasing amounts of the specific allergen, until tolerance is built against it.\\nFor example, if someone is allergic to flower pollen, the therapy may consist of shots laced with pollen in increasing amounts to increase the body\u2019s defense against pollen; the idea is similar to that of receiving the flu vaccine.\\nHow It Works\\nAllergy shots are usually administered in an immunologist\u2019s office (or a licensed physician), and can consist of several shots in one visit. The patient will be asked to stay in the office for 30 minutes or so after administering the dosage to make sure there are no serious reactions to the therapy. At the end of treatment, the patient will have minimal reactions to what he or she used to be allergic to.\\nBenefits Of Allergy Shots\\nAllergy shots can be a great investment for some in the long run, especially if health insurance can cover some of the cost. Here are some reasons to possibly get allergy shots:\\n- You have asthma. For some people, an allergic reaction can quickly become fatal, or can cause life-threatening asthma that needs to be treated immediately. Investing in immunotherapy that consists of allergy shots can be a wise choice to protect a person\u2019s life.\\n- Allergies that decrease quality of life. If your allergies are so serious that you cannot perform day to day activities, allergy shots can rescue you from such hardship. There is nothing worse than trying to get through a tough work day with itchy, watery, swollen eyes that refuse to stay open.\\n- Save money in the long run. If you feel like you are spending a good chunk of your paycheck on allergy medication, allergy shots can be a great investment for the long run. Take a moment and do some simple math: can all those antihistamines you purchased in the past for the sake of allergies cover the cost of allergy shots? If the answer is yes, it may be time to move on to allergy shots after consulting with your physician.\\n- Rush immunotherapy becoming available. Traditionally, a full course of therapy involving shots for immunotherapy can take a very long time, even years. For those that fear needles, this can seem torturous. However, rush immunotherapy, which drastically shortens the visits needed for injections, are becoming vastly available, hence shortening the overall time for therapy. Be sure to consult your doctor to see if this is right for you, as rush immunotherapy consists of getting as much as 9 to 10 shots per visit, and can put you at greater risk for a negative reaction.\\nConsiderations For Allergy Shots\\nHere are some considerations for allergy shots:\\n- People who fear needles. Those who have a deep, profound fear of needles (also known as trypanophobia) should not opt for allergy shots. All in all, the benefits of using other forms of allergy medication can outweigh the effects of trypanophobia, as it takes multiple visits and injections to complete the therapy.\\n- People who have food allergies. Allergy shots tend to not be as effective for food allergies. Consult your doctor for other possible options on management for food allergies.\\n- Time commitment. Immunotherapy via injection can be a huge time commitment for some, since each person reacts differently to therapy. It can take up to one whole year before any difference is felt, and up to five years or more to maintain the body\u2019s heightened tolerance for allergens. For some people, such time commitment may just not be possible.\\nThere are generally 2 phases to the treatment:\\n- The build-up phase: This phase is used to allow the body to build-up tolerance for the allergen. It can take as long as 12 months to see results during this phase.\\n- The maintenance phase: This phase is used to maintain the body\u2019s defense. It can take an additional 3 to 5 years after the build-up phase to see results in the maintenance phase.\\nIf you are deciding to undergo allergy shots for immunotherapy, be sure to consult your doctor to see if it is right for you. It may be a wise investment for your health in the long run.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"procedural","error":null,"n":1}

Jonas Gratzer \/ LightRocket via Getty Images\\nRefugees fleeing the impending effects of the climate crisis cannot be forced to return home, according to a new decision by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, as CNN reported. The new decision could open up a massive wave of legal claims by displaced people around the world.\\nThe first-of-its-kind ruling opens the door for a new kind of legal claim to future protections for people whose lives and health are threatened by a warming planet and sea-level rise, according to legal experts, as The Guardian reported. The ruling is expected to have profound consequences as the impacts of the climate crisis are predicted to displace tens of millions of people.\\nThe UN Human Rights Committee ruling started from the case of Ioane Teitiota, who applied for refugee protection from New Zealand, claiming that his life was at risk in his home country of Kiribati, which is predicted to be one of the first countries lost due to sea-level rise, as CNN reported. Kiribati is an equatorial island nation in the middle of the Pacific that spans 1.3 million square miles, but only has 310 square miles of land and roughly 110,000 people.\\nThe committee heard Teitiota\u2019s claim that his home island South Tarawa had increased in population by nearly 50 times from 1,641 in 1947 to 50,000 in 2010 due to sea level rising, leading to other islands becoming uninhabitable. That explosion in population has led to violence and social tensions, as The Guardian reported.\\nTeitiota claimed that a shortage of freshwater and difficulty growing crops because of the salinity of the water posed a threat to him and his family. Further, he argued that because the island is predicted to be uninhabitable in 10 to 15 years, his life was in danger if he remained there, according to The Guardian.\\nThe committee did not fully agree with him. It rejected his claim that he faced an imminent threat to his life. It said, \u201csea level rise is likely to render the republic of Kiribati uninhabitable \u2026 the timeframe of 10 to 15 years, as suggested by [Teitiota], could allow for intervening acts by the republic of Kiribati, with the assistance of the international community, to take affirmative measures to protect and, where necessary, relocate its population,\u201d according to the The Guardian.\\nHowever, the committee added that New Zealand and every country would violate a person\u2019s international rights if they force them back to countries where the climate crisis poses an immediate threat, according to CNN.\\nThat decision, which is not legally binding to countries, does point to obligations that developed countries will face as the climate crisis intensifies. In addition to sea-level rise, CNN pointed out that droughts and crop failure are also expected to contribute to the tens of millions who will need to move to other areas in coming years. Furthermore, a World Bank study from 2018 found that 143 million people across South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America are at risk of becoming climate migrants.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important here, and why it\u2019s quite a landmark case, is that the committee recognized that without robust action on climate at some point in the future it could well be that governments will, under international human rights law, be prohibited from sending people to places where their life is at risk or where they would face inhuman or degrading treatment,\u201d said Jane McAdam, director of the Kaldor center for international refugee law at the University of New South Wales, to The Guardian. \u201cEven though in this particular case there was no violation found, it effectively put governments on notice.\u201d\\n- Record 7 Million People Displaced by Extreme Weather Events in ...\\n- Climate Change Forces 20 Million People to Flee Each Year, Oxfam ...\\n- UN Pact Acknowledges Climate Migration for the First Time ...']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":893,"question":"why does simultaneous contrast illusion make color appear different","gold":"The Simultaneous Contrast Illusion works because people tend to make assumptions about colors based on surroundings rather than looking at objects in isolation. When a solid-colored horizontal bar is placed against a changing gradient background, the bar appears to change color from left to right even though it remains one consistent shade of gray. This occurs because our visual perception is influenced by the surrounding context rather than focusing solely on the object itself. While this might seem like a perceptual flaw, it could also be considered a positive trait as it demonstrates our ability to process the 'big picture.'","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:724ef22b-b350-4827-bad7-aa6fcc93c539>']","texts":"['Optical illusions are popular again thanks to the internet. (Perhaps there\\'s some irony to the renewed interest in these visual tricks: the most common illusions rely on people not looking too closely \u2014 and not looking too closely is one of the main side effects of internet-based media consumption.)\\nWhether you see optical illusions as neat party tricks or examples of the complexities of human perception and the evolution of the brain, they\\'re undeniably fascinating. Here are 10 classic optical illusions and the reasons why they continue to fool people to this day.\\n1. The Spinning Dancer Illusion\\nIs this figure spinning clockwise or counter-clockwise? (Image: Nobuyuki Kayahara\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nThis image shows a female dancer pirouetting in a continuous loop. The illusion has to do with the direction in which she is spinning. Viewers will initially think that she is turning in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. However, when observing the image at other times, the same viewer may feel absolutely certain that the dancer is spinning in the opposite direction. In reality, this animation is on a continuous loop and does not suddenly change directions.\\nWhy is it impossible to define the direction of the spin? This optical illusion tricks you with depth perception. Because there aren\\'t enough clues about the depth of the dancer image, no one can define the direction of her spin with absolute certainty. The image is a silhouette, so the dancer\u2019s pony tail or extended arm can only be seen when she\\'s facing to the side. They disappear from view at the critical moment when we need them to provide information about depth and direction.\\n2. Ames Room\\nThe Ames Room is one of the best (and most famous) examples of how perception is not always the same as the reality of what\\'s in front of them. When viewed from the front, an Ames Room appears to be a normal, square room with walls perpendicular to floor and ceiling. However, the back wall is in fact built at a sharp angle and the floor and ceiling are steeply slanted.\\nThis creates an illusion that makes people and objects on one side of the room seem much smaller or larger than people or objects on the other side of the room. Since perspective is important, many Ames Room models have some sort of pinhole viewing device so that the viewer sees the room from an angle where they cannot perceive the slanted floor and the different lengths of the walls. The idea behind the Ames Room has been used in movies such as \"The Lord of the Rings\" series to make some actors seem much shorter or taller than they really are.\\n3. Cafe Wall Illusion\\nThe so-called Cafe Wall Illusion has been described as a checkerboard with the squares slightly jumbled or off-kilter. The alternating light and dark squares do not line up directly with the squares on the rows above and below them. The result is that the horizontal lines in between each row appear to be slanted. In reality, the horizontal lines are perfectly parallel with one another and totally straight.\\nThe Cafe Wall Illusion (named after a wall in a Bristol cafe that inspired the idea) is similar to the Zollner Illusion, in which short line patterns are drawn across longer parallel lines at different angles to make the longer lines seem slanted when, in fact, they are perfectly straight. Most theories for explaining why the eye is fooled by such patterns have to do with people first focusing on the contrast between the light and dark spaces. They subconsciously use this contrast to define all the other shapes in the image in their mind even before they have focused on all the parts of the picture.\\n4. Simultaneous Contrast Illusion\\nThe Simultaneous Contrast Illusion uses a shaded background to trick the viewer into inferring things about the color of the main object (Photo: Dodek\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nIn this image, the horizontal bar in the middle of the picture is one solid color. However, the changing gradient behind the bar makes it seem like the color of the bar itself is changing as it goes from left to right. If the viewer uses their hands to block the background, it becomes obvious that the whole bar is indeed only one shade of gray.\\nThis trick shows that people tend to make assumptions based on surroundings rather than looking only at a singular object. This may seem like a flaw in humans\\' abilities of perception (the inability to look at an object without being influenced by the background), but it could also be seen as a positive trait (being able to look at the \"big picture\").\\n5. Penrose Stairs\\nThe Penrose Stairs, sometimes called impossible stairs, were created by father-and-son team Lionel and Roger Penrose (Photo: Sakurambo\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nThe Penrose Stairs, also known as the Impossible Staircase, is perhaps one of the most famous of all optical illusions. In this two dimensional image, the four flights of stairs appear to link together so that a climber would go up or down the steps in a continuous loop but never arrive at a higher or lower point.\\nThough it can only exist in two dimensions, the Penrose Stairs have become a popular subject for artists, who depict the stairs and other similar distorted perspectives in two dimensional paintings or drawings. In fact, this is just one example of the kind of perspective tricks that painters and other artists working with two-dimensional mediums have employed for centuries.\\n6. Ponzo Illusion\\nThe Ponzo Illusion is named after Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo, who came up with it in 1911. (Photo: Timjarrett\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nThe Ponzo Illusion relies on geometric shapes to trick the eye. The idea is similar to the Simultaneous Contrast Illusion: People will make assumptions about an object based on the information that they get from the background.\\nThe illusion is very easy to recreate. When he first came up with it, Italian psychologist Mario Ponzo drew two horizontal parallel lines that were exactly the same length. By then drawing vertical lines that gradually got closer together (not unlike a picture of a railroad going off into the horizon), Ponzo was able to trick viewers into thinking that the parallel line in the background was much longer than the one in the foreground.\\n7. Necker Cube\\nThe Necker Cube is an example of an ambiguous image. (Photo: BenFrantzDale\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nThe Necker Cube is a drawing of a square that has no clues about depth. This means that it\\'s virtually impossible to decide which part of the square is the front and which is the back. The idea is named after a Swiss scientist, Louis Necker, who first drew the square. The basic illusion is that some people will perceive a three dimensional cube with one side in the front while others will imagine that the very same side is the back of the cube.\\nThe Necker Cube can quickly become the subject of an argument, with some viewers having a strong opinion about which side is which. So often the challenge is not to decide which side is the front and which is the back, but to try and see the cube from another perspective (where the side that you\\'re certain is the front is actually in the back).\\n8. The Rabbit Duck Head\\nThis \\'reversible image\\' first appeared in a German humor magazine. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons)\\nOne of the earliest examples of an ambiguous illustration, the Rabbit-Duck Head Illusion was first published in Germany in the late 19th century. Such hidden images were quite popular at the time. In this particular example, the duck\\'s beak becomes the rabbit\u2019s ears and the eye is drawn in such a way that it fits for both the right-facing and left-facing animals.\\nThe image was used by early 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who studied the idea of perception and wrote academic papers that discussed the ways in which people perceive things.\\n9. The Ternus Illusion\\nJoseph Ternus is credited with coming up with the idea that is the basis for animated signage all over the world. (Photo: GregHubbard\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nThe Ternus Effect uses different frames of the same images to create a sense of motion. The idea was first discussed by psychologist Joseph Ternus. He came up with what seems like a pretty simple idea: If you show people the same image in different locations, they will automatically assume motion.\\nThis idea is the basis for animation and for the kind of animated signage that\\'s so common today. Because people are familiar with this kind of faux motion, it might not seem like an illusion. In fact, the Ternus Effect has been the subject of more research than any of the other illusions we have mentioned, with new studies and hypothesis being tested as recently as the early 2010s.\\n10. Optical art\\nOptical art uses elaborate color patterns to make static images appear animated (Photo: Fiestoforo\/Wikimedia Commons)\\nOptical art images seem to be moving even though they aren\\'t animated. Most theories about the illusion of motion in optical art have to do with the brain\u2019s inability to process the different colors and shapes simultaneously. In short, there is so much going on in these pictures that motion is perceived where none really exists.\\nThese images are most often associated with psychedelic art, but other schools also use optical art techniques, which have their roots in impressionism, dadaism, cubism and other more-classic forms of art. Many artists see this style as a way to challenge the perception of viewers or get them to interact with the work rather than simply viewing it.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"causal","error":null,"n":1}

The studio was home to numerous stars including Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart, and Katharine Hepburn, and was particularly renowned for its spectacular Technicolor musicals. Meanwhile, independent filmmakers like Shirley Clarke were challenging traditional Hollywood narratives. Clarke's 'The Connection' (1961) offered a raw, graphic depiction of drug addicts that contrasted sharply with Hollywood's 'good men gone bad' approach to addiction stories.

Their 1951 epic, \"Quo Vadis,\" holds the record for the largest number of costumes used in any motion picture: 32,000.\\nIn other years, M-G-M gave us such classics as \"Boys Town\" (1938), \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942), \"Father of the Bride\" (1950), \"A Patch of Blue\" (1965), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1965), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968)\\nBut those spectacular, Technicolor musicals were where M-G-M really shined, with hits like \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), \"Meet Me In St. Louis\" (1944), \"Anchors Aweigh\" (1945), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), \"Easter Parade\" (1948), \"The Pirate\" (1948), \"Show Boat\" (1951), \"An American in Paris\" (1951), \"Singing in the Rain\" (1952), \"Seven Brides For Seven Brothers\" (1954), \"Guys & Dolls\" (1955), \"Gigi\" (1958),and \"That\\'s Entertainment\" (1974).\\nElvis Presley made many of his early films for MGM, including \"Jailhouse Rock.\"\\nWhere did the studio get its name? \"Metro\" was an early film company which belonged to showman Marcus Loew; \"Goldwyn\" came from producer Samuel Goldwyn, and \"Mayer\" was none other than producer Louis B. Mayer.\\nAlas, M-G-M is not M-G-M anymore.\\nAt the zenith of the mania for corporate buy outs, M-G-M Studios fell victim to just such a takeover. The company was bought out by corporate raider Kirk Kerkorian, who auctioned off the studio\\'s prized possessions, and sold 38 acres of the studio\\'s legendary back lots to housing developers. (Dorothy\\'s ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" fetched $15,000, while the Cowardly Lion\\'s costume went for $2,400.) Historic sets were leveled. He funneled the money which he drained from the studio into construction of the giant M-G-M Grand hotel in Las Vegas.\\nM-G-M, the company, still exists in a new skyscraper in Century City, but stripped of both its historic Culver City studio lot and most of its former glory. The vast movie empire that was once M-G-M is no more. In the 70\\'s and 80\\'s, M-G-M essentially stopped making movies. In 1979 Kerkorian issued a statement saying that M-G-M was primarily a hotel company.\\nAfter acquiring United Artists in 1981 (thereby becoming MGM \/ UA), the company\\'s film library was bought out by media mogul Ted Turner in 1986 for his cable TV channel. (He started colorizing many of the B&W films over the objections of film purists.)\\nIn 1986, the M-G-M sign (and its lion logo) was removed from atop the Culver City studio.\\nThe Culver City location briefly became home to Lorimar Pictures (producing TV shows such as \"Dallas\"). Finally, in 1990 the grand old studio was purchased by Sony Entertainment of Japan; it is currently home to both Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures (which are also now divisions of Sony).\\nWith a grand history like that of M-G-M, you might expect the studio to offer a guided tour. Until very recently, they did not. But in mid-1999, they finally began offering a two-hour, guided walking tour of the grand old studio. The price is $20 per person. However, the emphasis of the tour is mostly on Columbia\/TriStar, not on M-G-M. To read more details about the new guided tour, click here.\\nThey also tape a few TV sitcoms at the old studio now and then, and if you call \"Audiences Unlimited\" you might be able to get free tickets to a taping of one of those shows. As a member of the live studio audience, you\\'ll be admitted onto at least some portion of the studio lot. Recently, Sony taped the sitcom \"The King of Queens,\" and the \"Donnie & Marie\" talk show on the lot..\\nOr you may prefer to just write for tickets to the game shows \"Jeopardy\" or \"Wheel of Fortune,\" both of which are now taped on the historic lot. (If you would prefer to try out as a contestant for either show, read this my section about game shows.)\\nOn a bright note, although the studio went without so much as a coat of paint from its sale in 1985 to 1994, Sony Pictures recently invested $100 million to refurbish the historic studio and help restore some of the luster to the lot. They repainted every building, restored the original ironwork gates on Washington Boulevard, built new walls, added nostalgic Art Deco touches and false fronts on Main Street, and put up huge, hand-painted murals of old movie posters. Studio buildings have been named after film luminaries such as Frank Capra, Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The much needed facelift has made the old M-G-M lot one of the most attractive in Hollywood. And considering that Sony wrote off $2.7 billion in losses in 1994, that was quite a laudable accomplishment.\\nIn September of 2004, MGM announced that it would merge with Sony Corp.\\nof America. In short, Sony bought MGM for $5 billion. There\\'s a touch of\\nirony in this, since Sony has owned the old MGM studios for years. Sony\\nacquired MGM mainly in order to get the company\\'s library of films, which\\nis believed to be its most valuable asset. It constituted the biggest library\\nof color movies in the world, including franchises such as \"James Bond\",\\nthe \"Pink Panther\" and \"Rocky\". Word is that MGM will\\ncontinue to operate as a private company (which Sony will own), and will\\ncontinue to put out several films a year, with Sony co-producing and co-financing.\\nRecentlyu, they had big hits with the James Bond films \"Skyfall\", \"Casino Royale\"\\nand \"Quantum of Solace\", and also released \"Hot\\nTub Time Machine\" , \"Valkyrie\", the \"Fame\"\\nremake, \"The Pink Panther\" and \"Rocky Balboa\". They also make the TV series \"Teen Wolf\".\\nTo read more about Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, click here.\\nTo see vintage photos of the old MGM and Lorimar Studios, click here.\\nPictures Studios (formerly M-G-M Studios) is located at the northwest corner\\nof Washington Boulevard & Overland Avenue, in Culver City.

Created by a woman director, Shirley Clarke, at a time when they were in very short supply, the film shattered stereotypes in just about every conceivable way. And yet, the film remained unseen for many years.\\nShirley Clarke was a vital part of the burgeoning post-war American film movement. She was one of the first signers \u2014 and the only woman \u2014 of the New American Cinema manifesto in 1961. For her first feature film, she decided to take on a controversial play by Jack Gelber that was running off-Broadway. The Connection was a play within a play within a jazz concert. It portrayed a group of drug addicts, some of them jazz musicians, waiting in a New York loft apartment for their drug connection. A producer and a writer, meanwhile, have entered their lives to study them and write a play about them. The brilliantly written Beat dialogue was blended with jazz music written by the great pianist Freddie Redd.\\nClarke changed the character of the writer to Jim Dunn, a young, preppy filmmaker out to make a name for himself by documenting the \"scene.\" As Clarke was best friends with the hot new indie directors, she added a level of humor by poking fun at the cinema verit\u00e9 movement. She also chose to keep the play\\'s one-set constriction, but she combined the French New Wave\u2019s mobile camera with a whirling choreography of movement and jazz to create an exciting, kinetic film that was acclaimed at the Cannes International Film Festival as a masterpiece. Yet even knowing the avant garde nature of the play and her film, little could Clarke recognize the furor the film was about to create.\\nAlthough Hollywood had previously depicted drug addiction in the recent years, it was mostly of the good men gone bad scenario with tragic endings. THE CONNECTION, with the raw, graphic depiction of drug addicts that Gelber wrote for the stage, A hit at Cannes, it was promptly banned by government censor boards for indecent language and a struggle ensued to have it theatrically screened in the United States. After a two-year battle, the producers and director ultimately won in court and as important as it was judicially, it was sadly a case of too little too late as the film lost its timeliness and failed at the box office. But among filmmakers, it was highly influential. The film has been out of distribution since the early 1980s.\\nArthur Ornitz\\'s black-and-white cinematography sparkles on the screen, and the performances of Freddie Redd and saxophone legend Jackie McLean sound impeccable in the new UCLA restoration.

More than two dozen offices, programs, and initiatives at MIT work to address sustainability and climate action, on and off campus.\\nThe Office of Sustainability (MITOS), specifically, executes on its mission of sourcing scalable climate solutions by collecting and analyzing campus sustainability data, collaborating on the development of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies, modeling climate resiliency at the site and campus scale, reassessing waste reduction and disposal strategies, addressing sustainable food systems and food insecurity, and assessing and informing commuter choice through Access MIT.\\nData remains an essential part of MIT\u2019s sustainability work. In 2020, MITOS continued to expand the data available to the MIT community via the MIT Sustainability DataPool \u2014 MIT\u2019s central portal to campus sustainability data \u2014 through newly added dashboards on waste stream contamination (available to the MIT community and general public), transportation and parking, and climate resiliency. The new MIT Climate Resiliency Dashboard is the result of an ongoing research collaboration and data sharing commitment between MIT and the City of Cambridge. The dashboard communicates projected potential risk to the campus from flooding under both today\\'s climate and a future changed climate. Complementing the City\u2019s Flood Viewer, the dashboard completes the projected flooding picture of such potential risk to Cambridge. The projected flood information shared is based on climate change scenarios that are drawn from the best available science while including ranges of uncertainty. The projected flood information will be revisited regularly to reflect updated projections specific to local climate change. All visualizations and data sets in the DataPool aid MIT community members in understanding past trends, identifying solutions, and preparing for future sustainability challenges.\\nOne of MIT\u2019s newly completed buildings, MIT.nano (Building 12), received the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s LEED Platinum certification for sustainable practices in new construction in 2020. Starting in 2016, MIT made a commitment that all new campus construction and major renovation projects must be designed to achieve a minimum of LEED Gold certification. MIT.nano joins the Morris and Sophie Chang Building (Building E52) as the second LEED Platinum-certified building on campus. There are 18 total LEED-certified spaces and buildings at MIT.\\nAs the pandemic drastically increased the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) for the MIT community, campus sustainability researchers began to focus on ways to sustainably equip community members with these essential items. In response, an interdisciplinary research team formed to identify short- and long-term sustainable procurement, sourcing, and disposal strategies for PPE at MIT with a focus on solutions scalable beyond campus as well. The research is supported by the Campus Sustainability Incubator Fund \u2014 administered by MITOS \u2014 which seeks to enable MIT community members to use the campus itself for research in sustainable operations, management, and design.\\nMIT also continued its efforts around sustainable procurement and materials management by advancing purchasing programs and recycling, food waste collection, and reuse systems that design out waste from the campus, in turn supporting Cambridge efforts. In 2020, several innovative waste pilots were completed at locations across campus, while soon-to-be occupants of the new E38 project in Kendall Square worked together to implement waste collection practices to drive sustainable behavior. MIT continues to serve on and chair the Cambridge Recycling Advisory Committee to help ensure a community-wide approach to zero waste efforts. In August, MIT worked with the City of Cambridge to provide an accessible site for its Household Hazardous Waste collection day.\\nAfter receiving a $250,000 grant from the Henry P. Kendall Foundation in early 2020, MIT was poised to begin a project that would bring more Massachusetts-grown surplus crops into the dining halls at MIT by strengthening partnerships with local food partners. While this project is on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic, MIT continues to set the groundwork for building a low-carbon food system that incorporates social justice and sustainability.\\nThrough the Access MIT program, the Institute continues to provide generous subsidies for staff, faculty, and post-docs for low-carbon commuting \u2014 including subway, bus, bicycling, and commuter rail \u2014 which resulted in a nearly 15% decrease in parking at gated facilities on campus in the first three years of the program.\\nMIT has been pleased to participate in the Cambridge Urban Forest Master Plan (UFMP) Task Force work throughout 2019. Building on the findings of the Cambridge Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA), the UFMP recognizes the collective role of City-owned public rights-of-ways and publicly accessible private-owned lands to provide \u201ccool corridors.\u201d These open space networks and gathering places provide City dwellers with shade, comfort, and better air quality along key urban transit corridors. Trees and soils are characterized as a \u201cliving infrastructure\u201d system that can increase resilience and mitigate the effects of climate change for the community.\\nThis focus correlates with MIT\u2019s efforts over the past few years to reinvigorate or provide new tree planting along key campus and public streetscape corridors. In each location, best practices such as the use of structural soils under paving, irrigation, and connected tree beds or tree trenches undergirds growing conditions where trees can survive and flourish despite urban stresses.\\nMoving Toward Climate Neutrality\\nThroughout 2020, MIT undertook collaborations focused on helping shape the implementation of the City\u2019s Net Zero Action Plan adopted in 2015. The Action Plan identified a path forward for moving the City toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions. MIT offices, including the Department of Facilities; the Environment, Health, and Safety Office; MITOS; and MITIMCo participated in numerous working groups organized by the City to provide stakeholder input on various components of the plan including new construction requirements, existing building energy efficiency, energy performance reporting, renewable energy procurement and generation, lab energy use, and local low-carbon energy supply.\\nSince 2015, MIT has been working aggressively toward the goal of a minimum 32% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 as called for in the MIT Plan for Action on Climate Change. Overall net emissions are now 24% below MIT\u2019s 2014 baseline, with emissions on campus reduced 6% over the previous fiscal year. This reduction was driven in part by gains in building-level energy efficiency investments, increased operational efficiency of the Central Utilities Plant (CUP), a less intense heating season, lower energy demand on campus spurred by Covid-19, and reduced carbon-intensity of the local electricity grid.\\nCampus energy efficiency remains a core component of MIT\u2019s multi-faceted strategy to reduce emissions. Energy audits of existing campus buildings focus on improved efficiency and enable significant energy and emissions savings. MIT\u2019s Department of Facilities continually tracks building energy use to prioritize these audits for buildings with the greatest potential for energy and emissions impact and, in turn, reduction. Energy audits follow a process of study, design, and implementation with energy usage and emissions reductions often realized one to two years following the beginning of the project.\\nMITOS continues to develop data to build a preliminary analysis of the Institute\u2019s Scope 3, or indirect, GHG emissions. This is done to inform MIT\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions activities (in addition to Scopes 1 + 2) and explore where strategic opportunities may exist to reduce emissions beyond what MIT is currently tracking. This effort has been collecting available emissions data including that of purchased goods and services, MIT-sponsored travel, commuting, and capital goods (furniture, fixtures, tools, etc.) using the World Resources Institute\/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol for Scope 3 framework.\\nThe MIT Climate Resiliency Committee, overseen by MITOS, works to collaboratively assess, plan, and operationalize a climate resilient MIT. It seeks to ensure a campus community that continues to fulfill its mission in the face of current and future climate risks and disruptions due to flooding from more frequent and extreme rains, storm surges, and rising sea-levels, as well as extreme heat events.\\nManaging the uncertainty of these climate risks requires understanding challenges and identifying adaptive opportunities through integrated \"layers of resilience\": community, buildings, infrastructure, and site. These layers are both interdependent and collectively critical to supporting MIT\\'s mission. Experts from the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change serve as partners contributing new research to reduce the uncertainty for operational decision-making.\\nThis applied research resiliency collaboration evaluates probabilities and models campus exposure to: 1) \u201cflash flood\u201d 1-3 hour intense rains; 2) day-long rain events from tropical storms, hurricanes, and nor\u2019easters; and 3) storm surge and sea level rise. Flood risk modeling is also integrating planning approaches learned from MIT\u2019s Covid campus response into climate resiliency planning by prioritizing protection and adaptation of critical research facilities, community functions, and core campus operations.\\nBenefitting from a data sharing and collaboration commitment with the City of Cambridge, the newly unveiled MIT Climate Resiliency Dashboard seeks to translate the science of these climate risks into visual maps for use in operational and strategic decision making about campus-wide planning, capital renewal, new capital projects, and community preparedness. This dashboard\u2019s interface was designed by MIT students and created using the latest campus stormwater model that is harmonized with the City of Cambridge Flood Viewer and the City\u2019s flood risk model. Representatives from MIT also serve on the City of Cambridge Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force.\\nOpen Sourcing Solutions\\nMIT is currently researching a number of climate change risks for open sourcing of findings to serve both the campus and Cambridge. Starting in 2020, MIT has begun hosting a quarterly research and modeling collaborative meeting among MIT research scientists, City staff, and modeling experts. Research findings to be explored through this MIT-City Flood Risk Collaboration include:\\n- Flash-flood modeling of historic Cambridge short duration rain events\\n- Updated characterization of future, changed climate conditions for Cambridge\\n- Upriver Charles River Basin flow risks to Cambridge\\n- Scale and intensity of convective storms in Cambridge under a changed climate\\n- Joint probability of different flooding events\\nLooking ahead to 2021, MIT will maintain its approach of applying what we know, empowering people to act, and pioneering solutions in sustainability to continue meeting aggressive goals. We will continue to seek collective engagement and action on priority areas that include:\\n- A commitment to developing an equity-focused approach to sustainability that begins by envisioning a safe, just, and healthy future for MIT, the City of Cambridge, and the world;\\n- Climate change and net zero action planning, including modeling and planning for climate adaptation and investments for a resilient campus;\\n- Modeling and planning for a climate resilient MIT;\\n- Expansion of data collection, data sources, and visualizations;\\n- Working collaboratively to transform the campus food system to promote health and system and individual sustainability;\\n- Managing the impact of the Institute\u2019s purchasing and waste systems in a manner that takes the full lifecycle costs and impacts of materials and products into consideration;\\n- Broadening and deepening MIT\u2019s commitment to sustainable transportation and robust participation in Access MIT;\\n- Utilization of both new and established strategies to mitigate campus emissions;\\n- Seeking a comprehensive understanding of our water use patterns in an effort to reduce overall demand and consumption across campus.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"factoid","error":null,"n":1}

Installing an ERRC system in the early stages of construction allows solid communication between first responders and your future occupants when disaster strikes. This blog will discuss the importance of an ERRC system in construction and the requirements it needs.\\nWhat is an ERRCS?\\nAn Emergency Responder Radio Communication System, or ERRCS, is an in-building communication system that is used to enhance critical communications inside and outside construction.\\nAn ERRCS is crucial to managing evacuation, improving critical communication, and boosting signal systems so that people and first responders remain safe in times of crisis.\\nEven though an ERRCS system uses smaller antennas (Distributed Antenna Systems or DAS) that allow first responders to stay in contact with each other using two-way radio signals, it differs from a DAS system.\\nDAS Systems engineers install ERRCS in your building by joining a Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) system to the donor antenna. The antenna receives signals that operate on private frequencies via first responder networks.\\nThe BDA uses cable or fiber and receives external radio signals to connect to a DAS and amplify the signals of buildings located in areas with poor coverage.\\nHaving an ERRCS in every residential structure is mandated by the NFPA and Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJ). It is based on International Fire Code (IFC), section 510, and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), code 72.\\nCommon ERRCS requirements\\nWhen planning to install an ERRC system in your building, there are a couple of requirements you need to be aware of, such as:\\nIt is tricky for big large constructions and building complexes to keep a strong signal strength. Buildings over 50,000 square feet, with 3 or more stories and underground parking require an ERRCS system. Materials like brick, concrete, wood, low e-glass, and metal block inhibit the signal and cause bad reception. DAS Systems strives to provide proper RF mapping to make sure all areas in the building have good coverage and comply with the IFC regulations.\\nTo regulate, preserve, and repair Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed radiotelephone transmitters, you need special training and an FCC General Radiotelephone Operator License (GROL), which DAS Systems engineers have.\\nIn case of an emergency, building tenants need to stay safe and vacate the premises quickly and carefully. Installing Signal boosters or DAS in vulnerable areas of your construction ensures that all radio frequencies first responders need remain amplified in your building.\\nIt\u2019s pivotal for constructions to have the standard signal strength used in critical communication, which is a 95% majority of minimum signal strength of -95dBm. In case the standard ERRC signal strength isn\u2019t reached, buildings need to install a DAS or a signal booster to be up-to-code.\\nPublic safety compliance revolves around ERRC testing and re-certification. DAS system offers annual testing and maintenance of your ERRCS system and ensures that your building is always up to standard. We work closely with you and alongside public authorities to design bespoke ERRCS systems and get you a Certificate of Occupancy, guaranteeing to satisfy all your building safety needs.\\nHaving battery backups is crucial in case any power outages happen in the building. Sometimes during an emergency, the power of the building needs to be cut for the occupants\u2019 safety; that\u2019s why having a reliable battery backup to keep the ERRC system running is a matter of life and death.\\nHow to know if my construction complies with local public safety building codes?\\nWhen in doubt about whether or not your construction meets safety requirements, it\u2019s good to run a test. Working with DAS Systems provides you with an ERRC testing that evaluates the signal strength in all the areas of your building and establishes which ones require signal augmentation. Furthermore, we verify every requirement of the IFC and NFPA codes and recommend improvements.\\nWhen planning on starting a construction project, it\u2019s always wise to involve a provider like DAS early in the construction design phase. This way ensures that the building\u2019s layout includes an ERRCS that helps limit casualties and keep people safe. But worry not; our team of DAS experts can also retrofit an ERRC system to existing buildings.\\nBefore designing an ERRCS system, our team employs predictive mapping and modeling to make sure that the entire area has access to top-notch coverage. Reach out to us for all your ERRC DAS needs to ensure that people in your building will get out unscathed the next time an emergency occurs.', 'A distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a network of antennas, cables and radio equipment installed inside (and sometimes outside) a venue that provides an enormous improvement in the quality of the wireless cellular services inside that venue.\\nIn its extremely basic form, a DAS has two primary components:\\n- Signal Source \u2013 because a DAS does not generate a cellular signal itself, it must be fed a signal from the wireless carrier, which is typically an on-site BTS (Base Transceiver Station) or a Small Cell.\\n- Distribution System \u2013 the cellular signal from the signal source is amplified, distributed, and rebroadcast throughout the venue using fiber optic cables, ethernet cables, coaxial cables, or a combination of these, finally reaching numerous antennas spread throughout the venue.\\nA BTS (sometimes referred to as an eNodeB) is the fundamental radio equipment commonly used at outdoor cell phone towers to generate the cellular signal. The BTS is connected to the primary or \u201ccore\u201d network of a wireless service provider by fiber optic cables. A very large venue may have multiple BTSs feeding a DAS. This type signal source is more robust than small cells, providing both more power and capacity. Also, each wireless carrier (e.g. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) will each have a separate BTS feeding the DAS. A wireless system that is purpose-built to work with all current and future wireless carriers is commonly referred to as a \u201cNeutral Host\u201d system.\\nSmall cells (sometimes referred to as femtocells, picocells, nanocells or metrocells) connect to the carrier\u2019s core network over a standard yet robust Internet connection. Small cells provide a high-quality wireless signal, but are typically only used in smaller venues due to their somewhat limited power and capacity, and are not easily scalable.\\nIn this scenario, the signal source is amplified at the DAS headend \u2013 the primary equipment at the \u201chead end\u201d or beginning point of the DAS \u2013 and then distributed throughout the venue through a series of splitters, couplers and coaxial cables to the individual antennas. This scenario is more affordable as it leaves the RF (radio frequency) signal in its original analog form, but can only cover a somewhat limited area due to the natural attenuation or losses of the RF signal in the coaxial cables.\\nIn an active DAS, the headend may combine multiple signal sources (usually from multiple carriers), converts them into digital signals, and then distributes those signals throughout the venue by either ethernet or fiber optic cables. These cables terminate at RRUs (remote radio units) or \u201cnodes\u201d which convert the digital signal back into analog RF signals. Depending on the manufacturer of the DAS equipment, the RF signals are then transmitted through the antennas attached directly to the RRUs (often referred to as \u201cfiber-to-the-node\u201d) or may be distributed through short runs of coax from the RRUs to the antennas.\\nThis configuration combines elements of both the passive and the active DAS. By using a network of both fiber optic cables and coaxial cables, the RRUs are separated from the antennas, and the number of remote units is reduced which reduces the overall cost of the system. A hybrid DAS is far more robust than a passive DAS, but less expensive than an active DAS. Simultaneously, this setup allows the DAS to cover large venues and is easily scalable. Additional portions of the venue can even be added at future dates.\\nIn a hybrid DAS, the headend combines multiple signal sources, converts them into digital signals, and distributes those signals throughout the venue by fiber optic cables to the RRUs, which in this case are spread much further apart than in an active DAS. The RRUs convert the digital signal back into analog RF signals which are then distributed in a particular defined portion of the venue through a series of splitters, couplers, combiners and coaxial cables to the individual antennas. One RRU may feed the antennas for one or two floors of a building, or some other defined area of a venue.\\nIt is worth noting, there are alternative low-end systems, sometimes referred to as a repeaters, BDAs (bi-directional amplifiers) or \u201coff-air\u201d DAS, that simply take a nearby outdoor cellular signal and retransmit it inside the venue. These are inexpensive, temporary band-aids for coverage issues, but often create other detrimental problems such as interference, and they cannot do anything to resolve capacity issues. Wireless carriers must approve the use of these systems, and often do not give such approval due to the likely interference and capacity issues.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"problem-solution","error":null,"n":2}

What does this mean? If your partner dies, or goes AWOL, you\\'ll be liable for all the debts, not just half of them.\\n- You\\'ll have to share profits with others\\n- Since decisions are shared, disagreements can occur\\n- Some employee benefits are not deductible from business income on tax returns\\n- The partnership may have a limited life; it may end upon the withdrawal or death of a partner. Forming a Partnership: Business Structure Options\\nAs I mention above, each state has specific laws on the formation and dissolution of business partnerships as well as laws regarding the legal responsibilities of each partner. There are three forms of legal partnerships that business owners can consider - general partnership, limited partnership and partnership with limited liability, or a joint venture. You can get more detailed information about these three types of partnership from the Small Business Administration here\\n.Have a Business Partnership Agreement\\nOnce you\\'ve decided on the structure of your business partnership, much like a pre-nuptual agreement, you need to put pen to paper and record a partner agreement. The agreement should include:\\n- The business name, structure, and partner information\\n- A description of the type of business that will be conducted\\n- How decisions will be made, the duties and responsibilities of the partners, as well as any limitations\\n- Details of any current or future financial contributions any partner will make\\n- How profits and losses will be handled\\n- A plan for dissolution, or your exit strategy The Tax Obligations of Business Partnerships\\nAs a business entity, the partnership itself does not pay taxes - each partner pays federal, state, and local taxes on their income from the partnership as if it were personal income.\\nPartnerships do, however, need to file an annual \"information return\" to report income, deductions, gains, losses, etc. with the IRS.\\nOnce you are operational as a partnership you can refer to information provided by the IRS here to help you determine some of the forms that you may be required to file.\\nYou can find out more information about complying with tax laws for business partnerships via the IRS\\' \"Tax Information for Partnerships\\n\" Web page.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"problem-solution","error":null,"n":2}

The Hell Creek formation is particularly suitable for this research as it's rich in specimens - researchers note it's difficult to walk through the formation without finding Triceratops fossils weathering from hillsides.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:78b113f2-d5c5-4393-a016-b2cb6dc4bbbb>']","texts":"['We\u2019ve all seen photos and animated videos of the three-horned Triceratops, one of the most popular dinosaurs that the public can recognize. But now scientists are saying that it didn\u2019t really exist, but the recovered bones were those of a juvenile form of a Torosaurus, the three horned dinosaur we haven\u2019t heard of. Apparently, dinosaurs\u2019 skulls can shape-shift.\\nThis discovery comes from a study of the iconic dinosaur triceratops and its close relative torosaurus. Their skulls are markedly different but are actually from the very same species, argue John Scannella and Jack Horner at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana.\\nTriceratops had three facial horns and a short, thick neck-frill with a saw-toothed edge. Torosaurus also had three horns, though at different angles, and a much longer, thinner, smooth-edged frill with two large holes in it. So it\u2019s not surprising that Othniel Marsh, who discovered both in the late 1800s, considered them to be separate species.\\nNow Scannella and Horner say that triceratops is merely the juvenile form of torosaurus. As the animal aged, its horns changed shape and orientation and its frill became longer, thinner and less jagged. Finally it became fenestrated, producing the classic torosaurus form (see diagram, right).\\nThis extreme shape-shifting was possible because the bone tissue in the frill and horns stayed immature, spongy and riddled with blood vessels, never fully hardening into solid bone as happens in most animals during early adulthood. The only modern animal known to do anything similar is the cassowary, descended from the dinosaurs, which develops a large spongy crest when its skull is about 80 per cent fully grown.\\nShape-shifting continued throughout these dinosaurs\u2019 lives, Scannella says. \u201cEven in the most mature specimens that we\u2019ve examined, there is evidence that the skull was still undergoing dramatic changes at the time of death.\u201d\\nEven in the most mature skulls, there is evidence that they were undergoing dramatic changes\\nScannella and Horner examined 29 triceratops skulls and nine torosaurus skulls, mostly from the late-Cretaceous Hell Creek formation in Montana. The triceratops skulls were between 0.5 and 2 metres long. By counting growth lines in the bones, not unlike tree rings, they have shown clearly that the skulls come from animals of different ages, from juveniles to young adults. Torosaurus fossils are much rarer, 2 to 3 metres long and, crucially, only adult specimens have ever been found.\\nThe duo say there is a clear transition from triceratops into torosaurus as the animals grow older. For example, the oldest specimens of triceratops show a marked thinning of the bone where torosaurus has holes, suggesting they are in the process of becoming fenestrated (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, vol 30, p 1157).\\nThe finding has implications for the supposed defensive function of the triceratops\u2019 frill. \u201cIf I was a triceratops I wouldn\u2019t want anything too damaging to happen to my frill, as it had numerous large blood vessels running over the surface,\u201d says Scannella. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine holding up a thin bony shield that can gush blood would be a very effective means of defence.\u201d\\nInstead it is likely that the headgear was a display to signal an individual\u2019s maturity to other members of the species. Differences between the sexes is another possibility but less likely, says Scannella.\\nIt was already known that triceratops skulls changed throughout their development, but not that the final result was a torosaurus. Torosaurus will now be abolished as a species and specimens reassigned to Triceratops, says Horner.\\nTriceratops isn\u2019t the only shape-shifter. Last year, Horner and Mark Goodwin of the University of California, Berkeley, claimed something similar for another iconic Hell Creek dinosaur, the dome-headed pachycephalosaurus, perhaps best known for headbutting jeeps in Jurassic Park 2.\\nTwo similar dinosaurs, classified as Dracorex and Stygimoloch, are also known from Hell Creek. Horner and Goodwin say that they are not separate species but juveniles of pachycephalosaurus (PLoS One, vol 4, p e7676). If so, this is an even more extreme case of shape-shifting than triceratops, with the animal growing horns and then re-absorbing them into its skull as it ages (see diagram).\\nSoft in the head\\nHorner says this makes it unlikely that pachycephalosaurus engaged in headbutting as it, too, retained spongy, immature bone throughout adulthood. As with the frill of triceratops, its dome was probably used for display.\\nOn top of that, a dinosaur called Nanotyrannus has been tentatively reclassified as a juvenile form of Tyrannosaurus rex.\\nTaken together, the \u201closs\u201d of four species from the Hell Creek formation reveals that the dinosaurs that lived there up until 65 million years ago were not as diverse as previously thought. Triceratops and torosaurus have long been regarded as the last survivors of the horned dinosaurs, a large group that appeared in the Jurassic and reached its heyday about 80 million years ago. Now it seems that only one species made it through to the end of the Cretaceous. This could be evidence to support a disputed theory that dinosaur diversity was in decline long before an asteroid impact wiped them out.\\nBoth Scannella and Horner say it is possible that other dinosaur species from Hell Creek will turn out to be juvenile forms, and add that the same thing is probably true of dinosaurs from other locations and times. \u201cJuvenile dinosaurs were not just miniature versions of adults \u2013 they looked very different and could easily be mistaken for distinct species,\u201d says Scannella.\\nThe idea that dinosaurs\u2019 skulls changed radically as they aged was first proposed in the 1970s, but it was difficult to test because dinosaur remains are usually so scarce and so it never gained wide acceptance.\\nScannella and Horner were able to make a strong case because triceratops is not scarce. \u201cIt is hard to walk out into the Hell Creek formation and not stumble upon a triceratops weathering out of a hillside,\u201d says Scannella. In the past decade, 47 complete or partial skulls have been found there.\\n\u201cThe work is startling, not least because triceratops and torosaurus have been so heavily studied for over 100 years,\u201d says Mike Benton, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Bristol, UK. \u201cTo suggest they are different growth stages of one form is a remarkable observation, and may well prove highly controversial, but the case is persuasive. It has always been difficult to distinguish the two.\u201d\\nGoodwin says the recent work is convincing and will mark a major shift in the field: palaeontologists must now factor in extreme changes in skull shape or risk misunderstanding evolutionary relationships and overestimating dinosaur diversity. Ignore physical development in dinosaur palaeontology \u201cat your peril\u201d, he warns.\\nSource: New Scientist.\\nBuy Cheapest Related Product From Amazon.com\\n| \u00ab Previous\\nStreet Fighter X Tekken review\\n| Next \u00bb\\nNew Motion-Control Video Game Teaches Teenagers How To Abstain From Sex']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"procedural","error":null,"n":1}

His group has developed and applied these and other tools for the study of physiology and behavior in health and disease, and supported researchers at Stanford and around the world by disseminating the reagents and techniques.

Submitted', 'By: Aleksandra Augustynowicz, writing for The Science in Society Review\\nImagine a healing pinpoint of light, fixed in the center of your forehead, radiating beams of energy throughout your body\u2014a snippet from your local meditation class, or a clairvoyant glimpse of the future. About 121 million people worldwide suffer from depression, and in 2000, the illness was 4th in the global burden of disease. It is expected to rise to second place in 2020, affecting both sexes of all ages. Seven out of every thousand adults worldwide have Schizophrenia . Millions are struggling with anxiety, while others are battling neurodegenerative diseases. Current treatments are not always effective due to the brain\u2019s many still-unresolved mysteries. But the new field of optogenetics can now tease apart the workings of the nervous system.\\nOptogenetics depends on transfecting target cells with viral vectors to express protein ion channels that respond to different wavelengths of light. Blue light stimulates proteins taken from freshwater algae Chlamydomans Reinhardtii, green light affects those from its relative Volvox Carteri, and yellow works on those of the archaebacteria Natronomona Pharaonis. Once the proteins are expressed on the target cell membrane, a wire ending in a small light is guided to the desired area of the brain. Turning on the light stimulates the proteins. When activated, they regulate the electrical activity of cells. Pulses of blue, green, or yellow wavelengths can be used to select and excite the desired cells without affecting the functions of their neighboring cells . In this way, optogenetics give a way to modulate specific neuronal pathways as appropriate stimulations evoke responses like movement, altered behavior, or even memory retrieval. Studying these selective pathways and observing their effects brings us ever closer to understanding brain function. Though optogenetics can prove to be a powerful tool in medicine, this new dawn for mental health studies and the unveiled brain could bring on blindingly bright discoveries about ourselves\u2014it could upset the way we think of emotions and interpersonal relations. It debunks ontological questions of identity and existence.\\nOptogenetics could be the new treatment therapy for depression or addiction. It provides insight into pleasure-system pathologies and mechanisms of substance abuse by facilitating the study of groups of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. Dopamine plays an important role in the control of movement, emotion, and pleasure or pain sensations , while cholinergic receptor activation modulates numerous complex and often opposing biological processes . Studying these pathways requires a method that is selective and temporally precise. Ilana Witten and colleagues from Princeton University have identified patterns in reward pathways by pulsing light onto chosen receptors in transfected mice. The neurons selected were sensitive to cocaine, and the study suggests that optogenetics can block cocaine conditioning in mammals. The control of the microcircuit disrupts the effects of drug abuse . The same reward pathway might be turned off in a mother with a cocaine addiction, and allow her to focus on those she loves, making optogenetics a potent tool.\\nThis tool was used to probe the mechanism behind depression with a study of the prefrontal cortex neurons in mice; humans have corresponding neurons that are thought to contribute to the disease. The mice were subjected to chronic social defeat stress\u2014a model of bullying\u2014by being exposed to an aggressive mouse. After repeated contact, the stressed mice showed social avoidance\u2014a sign of depression. Neurons in the mouse brain showed gene expression that mimicked tissues from the prefrontal cortex of clinically depressed postmortem human patients. A fiber was inserted to light up and stimulate the pre-frontal cortex, and the mice fully recovered from depression symptoms\u2014they began to interact with other mice. The optogenetic manipulation of cortical neuron firing highlighted the key activity of the prefrontal cortex in depression-like behavior and showed the possibility of counteracting depression symptoms. Evidence suggested that electrical stimulation can relieve depression that is resistant to other treatments .\\nAnxiety, the most common among psychiatric disorders, has been linked to the amygdala\u2014a region in the brain associated with emotional processing. The neural mechanisms behind the condition, however, were unknown until precise optogenetic stimulation of mouse basolateral amygdala terminals showed a reversal of anxiety symptoms. Conversely, when the cells in this region were optogenetically inhibited through glutamate receptor antagonism, anxious behavior increased . Could the calming effect of waving lighters during a Pink Floyd concert be optogenetics\u2019 new color in the band\u2019s iconic prism?\\nBecause of the brain\u2019s complexity, chemical treatments are limited for psychiatric disorders that are due to chemical imbalances in the brain. The networks of synapses stretch far beyond local chemical composition. Medications acting to restore the chemical balances affect neuron firing in the whole circuitry of the brain rather than solely targeting the defective link. Treatment effectiveness varies. Optogenetic targeting, on the other hand, allows for selective control with exceptional temporal precision\u2014the stimulus does not affect nearby cells that are not meant to be excited . Thanks to this method, we can start to hone in on the mechanisms within the mysterious brain.\\nOptognetic potential to treat neurological diseases was shown in mice with Autism and Schizophrenia, which correspond to defects in neural interactions. Elevated ratio of cortical cellular excitation to inhibition (E\/I balance) in cells contributes to disease symptoms. After activation of their prefrontal cortical excitatory neurons with light, autistic mice showed an increased preference for social interaction . This study gave insight to cell and circuit level changes that would not have been possible with just pharmacological manipulation. It leads us closer to understanding the pathophysiology behind social and information-processing dysfunctions.\\nWe\u2019ve come far in our Odyssey across the nervous system, hacking away, shocking, dousing, and stimulating. We know the general architecture of the brain and the responsibilities of each part. With time, instead of just knowing the area of the brain responsible for a reaction, we can now target the specific subgroups of neurons. These can be studied with temporal specificity and spatial selection. The new method provides insight into how neural circuits coordinate reward-driven learning and decision making. The promising knowledge we gain through these studies has a price: our current understanding of ourselves. We could end up classifying love as just a series of equations and cellular events\u2014a pleasure-reward pathway. Our perception of the feeling would become a collection of electrical signals in determined cells. The knowledge may cause disillusion: what would happen to the magical mystery that moved Petrarch to compose? What makes a human special apart from his physical being is his love, his desire to philosophize, his ability to dream and imagine. Reducing the metaphysical qualities to electrical calculations might upset the classic idea of \u201cman.\u201d An optogenetic dissection of the amygdala, hypothalamus and orbifrontal cortex to discover treatment for mental illnesses could also mean a dehumanization of emotions: chemical and physical processes. Psychopathologies arise with a lack of empathy , but their study would expose biological motivations behind the feeling. We have to understand that as the ultimate Homo sapiens, literally the \u2018knowing man\u2019\u2014having insight into the very organ that allows us to see within ourselves\u2014we gain knowledge that comes with the price of the magic of individualism.\\nLooking into the future of neuroscience, Francis Crick predicted \u201cWhen we finally understand scientifically our perceptions, our thoughts, our emotions and our actions\u2014hopefully sometime in the 21st century\u2014it is more than likely that our view of ourselves, and our place in the universe will be totally transformed\u201d . Our possibilities will have transformed along with our views. Despite our immense progress we still have a long way to go. As of right now, if Francis Crick had read enough Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, perhaps he might have quoted Sherlock Holmes: \u201cI am a brain Watson.

Economic and political interests are said to be the driving forces behind signing the investment treaties. However, there is virtually no systematic evidence on whether countries consider human rights performance of the host country while signing bilateral investment treaties. We make an attempt to examine this question by considering 87 developing countries over a period 1980-2006. Different estimation techniques like: negative binomial and poisson models are used. The results demonstrate that economic interests drive bilateral investment treaties to human rights performance. Economic interests measured by economic development, long-term investments, return on investments and macroeconomic risk are significant while human rights performance namely, political terror scale and physical integrity rights remain consistently insignificant. The results are robust to the use of alternative estimation techniques and sensitivity analysis. These results highlight that economic interests preside over social conscience while countries signing investment treaties.\\n|Item Type:||MPRA Paper|\\n|Original Title:||Economic Interest versus Social Conscience Signing Bilateral Investment Treaties \u2013 Does Human Rights Matter?|\\n|Keywords:||bilateral investment treaties, FDI and human rights performance|\\n|Subjects:||P - Economic Systems > P3 - Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions > P33 - International Trade, Finance, Investment, Business, and Aid\\nF - International Economics > F2 - International Factor Movements and International Business > F21 - International Investment; Long-Term Capital Movements\\n|Depositing User:||Krishna Chaitanya Vadlamannati|\\n|Date Deposited:||26.

{"id":736,"question":"How has the sophistication of social engineering attacks evolved from basic phishing attempts to modern techniques?","gold":"Social engineering attacks have evolved significantly. While companies still receive obvious phishing emails with blurry logos and misspellings, modern attacks have become much more sophisticated. Current attacks create exact replicas of company communications and can include personal details of targeted victims. The success rates show this evolution - while basic messages from fake companies only achieved 11% success, messages appearing to come from real companies resulted in 33% of recipients taking risky actions. Modern attackers have also become more strategic, using emotional triggers like subject lines about 'employee firings' (38% response rate) or 'annual bonuses' (25% response rate). They now employ both high-tech tools and low-tech strategies, with some attackers even successfully defrauding companies of up to $100 million using sophisticated email spoofing techniques.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:fa92a098-eec8-474b-bb5a-51a8ef74edc0>', '<urn:uuid:0c541c51-8b2c-4f51-98c7-7d581edc40d0>']","texts":"['1 In 10 Fooled By Social Engineering Attacks\\nA new report by security firm Positive Technologies shows that 1 in 10 employees would fall for a social engineering attack.\\nWhat Is A Social Engineering Attack?\\nSocial engineering cyber-attacks rely upon the element of human error e.g. convincing \/ fooling a person into downloading malicious files, unwittingly corresponding with cyber-criminals, sharing contact information about employees and transferring money to hackers\u2019 accounts, or clicking on phishing links.\\nThe results of the report are based on \u2018penetration tests\u2019 which involved sending 3,300 emails to employees containing links to websites, password entry forms and attachments. As the name suggests, a penetration test is an authorised simulated attack on a computer system, which is performed in order to evaluate the security of that system.\\nThe results showed that, worryingly, 17% of the messages were successful in convincing the recipients to take actions that would have resulted in a compromise of a workstation and potentially the entire corporate network if the attack was real.\\nReal Company Names Convincing\\nThe study showed that messages received from what appeared to be the account of a real company resulted in 33% or risky actions being taken by recipients, whereas messages from fake companies only resulted in 11% success.\\nEmotional Response Sought\\nCyber-criminals often use methods that are designed to produce an emotional response that will make people forget about basic security rules. For example, in the tests, an email subject line of \u2018list of employees to be fired\u201d resulted in a 38% response, and \u201cannual bonuses\u201d brought a 25% response.\\nOverly Trusting If Not In IT\\nOne interesting finding highlighted in the report was that 88% of those outside of IT work (and presumably less aware of the risks), such as accountants, lawyers and managers, opened \/ clicked on suspicious links and even corresponded with attackers. However, 3% of security professionals also responded.\\nKept Trying To Open\\nThe study found that some recipients who couldn\u2019t open the malicious files even resorted to trying to open the files or enter their password on a fake site up to 40 times!\\nWhat Does This Mean For Your Business?\\nClearly, there is a case for better education and training among employees about the variety of methods, and the level of sophistication that cyber-criminals now use in attacks. Employees need to be able to spot potential attacks, and have clear policies, instructions, and help on hand about how to proactively protect the company, and how to respond to certain types of attack. One of the simplest forms of defence against threats entering the company via email is to make it policy never to open suspicious emails \/ emails from unknown sources.\\nIn reality, attackers now use a combination of methods to breach the defences of companies, plus there are evolving new threats, such as fileless hacking and fileless malware attacks facilitated by the PowerShell scripting language that is already built-in to Windows. Some basic ways that your business can improve security against social engineering attacks are :', 'Social-engineering attacks are no longer the amateurish efforts of yesterday.\\nSure, your company may still get obvious phishing emails with blurry logos and rampant misspellings, or the blatantly fake \"help desk\" calls from unknown phone numbers, but more sophisticated attacks are becoming the norm.\\nUsing both high-tech tools and low-tech strategies, today\\'s social-engineering attacks are more convincing, more targeted, and more effective than before. They\\'re also highly prevalent. Almost seven in 10 companies say they\\'ve experienced phishing and social engineering.\\nFor this reason, it\\'s important to understand the changing nature of these threats and what you can do to help minimize them.\\nKnow the Threat\\nToday\\'s phishing emails often look like exact replicas of communications coming from the companies they\\'re imitating. They can even contain personal details of targeted victims, making them even more convincing.\\nIn one incident, bad actors defrauded a U.S. company of nearly $100 million by using an email address that resembled one of the company\\'s vendors. And in the most recent presidential election, hackers used a phishing email that appeared to come from Google to access and release a top campaign manager\\'s emails.\\nBad actors can get sensitive data in many other ways. In one case, they manipulated call-center workers to get a customer\\'s banking password.\\nAnother way is to target data that\\'s visually displayed on a laptop or mobile-device screen. For example, a bad actor could pose as a trusted vendor in an office or a business associate in a foreign country and subtly capture data with a smartphone or hidden recording device.\\nA Three-Tiered Defense\\nGiven the prevalence and advanced nature of social-engineering threats, your privacy and security measures should cascade across three key areas: people, processes, and technology.\\nSome measures to consider using in each area include:\\n1. People: Provide ongoing training to educate workers about social-engineering threats, and procedures for preventing or responding to them. Employees who regularly handle sensitive information are more likely to be targeted \u2014 including HR, sales, and accounting workers. They should be your company\\'s most knowledgeable workers about threats and procedures \u2014 and should be fully engaged to help identity threats.\\nFor example, encourage workers to use the \"Report email\" or \"Report as phishing\" icons that can be enabled in Microsoft Outlook. The service provides an easy way for workers to report suspicious messages so IT can take steps to mitigate their impact. IT managers can also monitor the use of the icon to statistically track worker awareness and engagement.\\nIf your company has separate IT and security teams, make sure there is a clear understanding about who is responsible for managing social-engineering threats. Any misunderstanding between these parties can lead to security gaps and a lack of accountability if an attack occurs.\\n2. Processes: Policies that encourage workers to not click on suspicious links or provide information to outside organizations go without saying. But make sure you also have procedures for workers to give you details about attempted attacks. This can help you investigate suspicious emails, URLs, and phone numbers, and better understand your vulnerabilities.\\nAs you review and refine your policies, always aim for simplicity. Overly complex security protocols can be too much for workers to remember and can fail.\\n3. Technologies: Security-perimeter controls like antivirus protection and intrusion-detection\/intrusion-prevention systems remain vital. Also, use security intelligence tools to understand your security ecosystem and the potential risks you face. And encrypt data to make it unreadable, even if it\\'s stolen.\\nAll laptop and mobile-device screens should be fitted with privacy filters. The filters black out the angled views of screens to help office workers and business travelers safeguard data from onlookers or even cameras.\\nA strong defense against social-engineering threats requires more than training and educating workers. You and your IT team must be vigilant about emerging threats so that as they evolve, your security and privacy measures evolve with them.\\nLearn from the industry\\'s most knowledgeable CISOs and IT security experts in a setting that is conducive to interaction and conversation.

FREEDM system is a culmination of high bandwidth digital communication, power electronics and digital communication.\\nIt replaces conventional transformer of 60 Hz with solid state transformer (SST) incorporating bidirectional power flow. Solid state transformer is a package of cascaded rectifier, dual active bridge converter and inverter. It has an input of 7.2 kV AC and output of 120 V AC single phase, 208 V AC (3 phase) and 400 V DC.\\nAll the DC loads, distributed generation and energy storage devices are connected to the DC link and AC loads are connected to the AC output.\\nTo demonstrate the advancement done in FREEDM project, a 1 MW green energy smart hub is under development. The proposed FREEDM loop allows consumers to plug and play energy sources or storage devices from anywhere on the loop.\\nTo provide effective power flow, power distribution and fault detection; intelligent energy management (IEM) and intelligent fault detection (IFD) control schemes are incorporated in the FREEDM system.\\nFollowing Figure 1 shows the schematic layout of the FREEDM system and Figure 2 shows the single line diagram of the FREEDM system. The FREEDM loop is connected to grid and in the case of grid failure, the loop can operate independently.\\nObjectives of the research\\nThe power flow in the FREEDM system is bi-directional due to the presence of distributed generation (DG) and the conventional protection methodologies must be modified accordingly to detect fault conditions and prevent false tripping. The solid state transformers (SST) have self-protection, which shuts them down during faults when the voltage goes below a certain threshold voltage and it can be adjusted.\\nIn the case of a loop system during faults, the voltage of the entire loop plummets to zero or typically a low value. In such a scenario all the SST\u2019s connected to the loop will shut down due to its self-protection.\\nHence, it is important to isolate the faulted part of the network from the rest of the system to prevent the shutdown for SST\u2019s. Pilot differential protection was developed as a solution to the above mentioned problem. It was able to detect faults within quarter of a cycle but it suffered from the problem of communication.\\nEthernet cable was used as the communication medium to transfer the sampled signals from the current transformers to the central processor. The central processor analyzes the sampled current signals, generates the trip depending up on the system conditions and sends the trip signal back to the breaker.\\nA protection method is developed that could protect looped systems with multiple sources without using any sort of communication. Directional relays with time inverse over current characteristics are coordinated affectively to detect and sectionalize the fault location without affecting the healthy part of the system.\\nThis serves as a reliable back-up protection system when the communication system fails.\\nA new pilot protection method is developed using the commercial SEL relays which uses the direction of fault currents to locate the fault. The communication is done using fiber-optic cables and the only data needed to be transferred between the relays is the fault location which is transferred in the form of digital bits.\\nSimulation, hardware implementation and real time digital system (RTDS) validation is explained in the thesis. A protection method is suggested monitoring the sychrophasor measurements, voltage of the system and current during faults.\\n|Title:||Design of protection schemes in networks with future renewable electric energy delivery \u2013 Pavanchandra Mandava, Master Thesis at ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY|\\n|Download:||Right here | Get Download Updates | Get More With Premium Membership|']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}

In preparation for this big event, the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden are hosting an exhibition about the Wall, the old GDR (DDR) times and the life in a city divided by stone.\\nLearn about the construction of the wall on August 13, 1961 \u2013 the life with and behind a wall, the diversity between east and west and the fall of the wall on November 09, 1989 \u2013 the Exhibition not only features a variety of photographs but also various historical objects.\\nThe Bernauer Stra\u00dfe is a street in Berlin\u2019s Mitte district, it was named after the City of Bernau which is located about 10 km northeast of Berlin. During the old GDR times, the Wall was erected alongside this street and it became famous for numerous escapes from windows of nearby apartments and houses in the eastern part of the city.\\nNow, a part of it was turned into a memorial park, explaining the history of a divided Berlin, with a newly constructed Visitor and Information Center, a viewing platform and an exhibition about the time when the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961.\\nA lot is happening in Berlin right now, the famous East Side Gallery, one of Berlin\u2019s historical Landmarks, painted by many international artists, faces partial demolition.\\nThousands of protesters have gathered during the last days, at the longest remaining stretch of the Berlin Wall, to protest against a planned construction project, to remove small parts of the wall to make way for a luxury block of flats on the former GDR death strip.\\nOn Sunday, March 17-2013, David Hasselhoff came back to Berlin, to support the protest, driving alongside the wall in a yellow van mounted with speakers while singing \u201cLooking for Freedom\u201d, the same song he sang at the 1989 New Year\u2019s Party in Berlin, shortly after the wall dividing East and West Germany was torn down.\\nThe Checkpoint Charlie is one of Berlin\u2019s most famous landmarks, which served as the only crossing point for diplomats, journalists and non-German visitors, between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War, from the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 till the fall on November 9, 1989.\\nIn October 1961, US and Soviet tanks had a close encounter because of a dispute over whether East German guards were authorized to examine the travel documents of a U.S. diplomat passing through to East Berlin, both sides tanks faced each other in an acrimonious moment feared around the World as a possible lead up to World War III.\\nToday, it is a must see sight in Berlin with huge historical and emotional resonance, even accounting for the fact that there is remarkably little left to recall the atmosphere of pre-1989 days.\\nFour days of celebration with a major parade to end it all.

Tacheles is a large (9000 square meter) building on Oranienburger Stra\u00dfe in the district known as Mitte. The exterior of the building was damaged from shelling in World War II, and much of the damage was never repaired. Huge, colorful graffiti-style murals are painted on the exterior walls, and modern art sculptures are featured inside.\\nThe Kunsthaus was formerly a department store in the Jewish quarter (Scheunenviertel) of Berlin, next to the synagogue, it was originally called Friedrichsstadtpassagen. After serving as a Nazi prison, the building was taken over by artists, who called it \u201cTacheles\u201d, Yiddish for \u201cstraight talking.\u201d\\nThree pieces of the Berlin Wall were placed in front of the famous Paris Bar in Berlin\u2019s district Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf.\\nThe Paris Bar is a place where artists, writers, journalist and film stars typically congregate and where Iggy Pop once gave a Rolling Stone journalist a blitzed interview that ended with him rolling around on the sidewalk out front. The French bistro has been a local favorite since it cheered up the postwar years in dismal bombed-out Berlin.\\nThe pieces, each 3,60 meters high and 1,20 meters wide, were designed by the owner himself, of course, the owner of the Paris Bar, not the Berlin Wall.\\nPiano Music meets StreetArt.\\nLast weekend, I took a walk through Berlin\u2019s Mauerpark, a public park in Berlin\u2019s Prenzlauer Berg district near some remains of the Berlin Wall and I discovered a couple of fancy painted pianos standing around with street artists working on them.\\nAfter I gathered some information, I now know that the whole thing was the start of a new event.

Crucially, this instrument enables CBRNe response teams to safely and realistically train without the need for a potentially hazardous ionizing radiological source.\\nFor the CBRNe instructor, there is also the advantage of retaining full control of the exercise, with the ability to conduct multi-detector or multi-threat training within the same operational scenario.\\nMonitoring of personal exposure\\nWhen attending CBRNe incidents, emergency services personnel also need to be able to monitor their own exposure to any forms of potentially harmful radiation - and to react quickly in the event that acceptable dose rate levels are exceeded.\\nIn such circumstances they rely on the services of an electronic personal dosimeter (EPD), such as the EPD Mk2, which has been designed to respond to gamma, beta and X-radiation.\\nFor the purposes of training however, the use of a simulator equivalent such as the EPD Mk 2 SIM retains all the user interface of the real dosimeter but which responds to safe, environmentally friendly, simulation radionuclide sources.\\nSafe and realistic chemical detection\\nThe detection of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) or toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) relies on the use of a person worn device such as the Smiths Detection LCD3.3.\\nA key benefit of this form of detector is its ability to identify specific CWAs, however personnel safety, and environmental considerations, can render many forms of simulant-based training impractical for CBRNe exercises.\\nWhen the highest levels of realism are required, a simulator detector such as the LCD3.3-SIM can prove an invaluable training resource. The LCD3.3-SIM has been designed to respond to electronic sources to safely replicate all the features and functionality of the real detector, while at the same time mitigating all risk.\\nRemote control features, together with powerful After Action Review (AAR) also ensure that instructors retain complete control of the exercise and that trainees understand if, or when, they've gone wrong.\\nPortable chemical contamination control\\nA portable chemical contamination control device such as the AP4C can be used to directly detect a wide range of chemical agents (and their precursors) including compounds of phosphorus (G and V agents), sulfur, arsenic compounds and gases such as ammonia, Cyanogen chloride and Cyahydric acid. For training purposes however, being able to operate without the need for harmful simulants can be a major asset.\\nWhen authenticity is required, but with no compromise on trainee safety, a simulator detector such as the AP4C-SIM can provide an invaluable solution. This particular device can also be used in conjunction with detection instruments that work on different technology principles - to provide compatibility with other simulator products (such as CAMSIM, LCD3.2e-SIM, RAID-M100-SIM and the S4PE-SIM) for multi-detector \/ multi-substance training exercises.\\nMajor terror incidents such as the Salisbury nerve agent attacks and the Manchester Arena bombing provide a stark reminder of the constantly evolving nature of CBRNe threats - and of how heavily we rely on the knowledge and expertise of our region's specialist CBRNe response teams.\\nEffective CBRNe training requires the highest levels of realism and authenticity, but whilst still ensuring there is zero compromise on personnel safety. In such scenarios, simulator detector technology can provide a viable and effective solution that puts instructors firmly in control of their exercises.\"]","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":224,"question":"Is it true that cyber criminals typically attack sensitive systems directly, and that a single misconfigured server can compromise an entire system?","gold":"The first part is false but the second is true. Hackers often use 'pivoting' - gaining access to one system and using it to breach other connected systems, rather than attacking sensitive systems directly. And indeed, a single misconfigured server, insecure device, or unpatched network device can introduce a hole that can allow your entire system to be compromised.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:e250da54-45ce-4101-b23c-5ee85e6648bc>']","texts":"[\"WE WILL TEST THE SECURITY OF YOUR NETWORK AND FIND ANY VULNERABILITIES\\nNetwork security is as much a business and legal concern as it is a technical concern.\\nA large portion of virtually every business enterprise today relies heavily on different types of infrastructures whose backbone is based on networking. Maintaining the security of those networks is as important as the security of your company data and communications systems. Many corporate systems - such as systems dealing with digital communications, e-commerce, transactions, trading, marketing, data storage, billing, etc. - rely on networks, whether in the form of email, telephones (i.e. VOIP), smart-devices, servers, routers, endpoint devices, and more.\\nMany critical corporate cyber-security systems are also directly integrated with network systems, such as VPNs, firewalls, network encryption systems, and web applications. Network security statistics show that in 2015, 66 percent of significant, sensitive data was stored on-site. Your company's network may have points or segments that directly expose your sensitive servers to the world via connections to the public internet. If your company has a website, then the web server and web application server - that are many times linked to backend systems - could allow a cyber-criminal to obtain unauthorized access to your servers if proper security controls are not in place, which can result in a data breach. If your company has host systems that can access the public internet, then Next Generation Firewalls, Network Intrusion Detection systems (IDS), etc. are necessary controls.\\nIT IS PIVOTAL TO HAVE A THOROUGH NETWORK SECURITY POLICY IN PLACE, ALONG WITH ROUTINE AUDITS, TO ENSURE THAT YOUR NETWORK SYSTEMS ARE SECURE.\\nThe configuration of your network, as well as its architecture, is equally important as a lack of patches, in conjunction with network misconfigurations, can create security holes that can be exploited. Thus it is imperative for you to intimately know the design and architecture of your entire corporate network including knowledge of your servers, the placement and use of your routers and switches, and how everything is configured. Because network designs and implementations change, it is important for your company to keep abreast of all changes to make sure that no security holes are introduced into your corporate systems, especially when there are hardware or software changes in your environment (i.e. updating or changing your network design, changing router configurations, hardware firewalls, servers, and other network devices).\\nThe best way to actively remain up to date regarding your network is to monitor all network software and hardware. Networking services and applications are very dynamic in nature, which means that they become moving targets for cybercriminals, and also means that attack surfaces are constantly changing. Without network monitoring and full knowledge of the attack surface it is impossible to defend your network from cyber-attacks. This is why constant network monitoring and network security testing must be conducted, and we are fully equipped and trained to carry out such tests in order to detect vulnerabilities.\\nTHE NETWORK WHICH PROVIDES VITAL INFORMATION FLOW THROUGH YOUR ORGANIZATION ALSO MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR ATTACKERS TO ACCESS SENSITIVE DATA\\nIT networks operate as communication channels for data to be transmitted and received. Business networks operate as interconnected systems - from private backend host systems to the public internet - and as noted before, segments of your network that are connected to the public internet allow an entrance into your backend systems.\\nThus your networks must maintain a tight seal of cyber-protection, which entails that all systems must be up to date, tested, and patched. This is because a single misconfigured server, insecure device, unpatched network device, server, router, etc. can introduce a hole that can allow your entire system to be compromised. More importantly is the fact that hackers often utilize the principle of pivoting when compromising a system, which essentially is the offensive mechanism for gaining access to a network system and utilizing that system to connect to - and breach - other systems that are connected to it.\\nThus a cyber-criminal could potentially conduct a multitude of indirect attacks to compromise your entire corporate network by attacking one system after another in order to ultimately gain higher levels of access to more sensitive systems which can result in data breaches, data extraction, and data theft.\\nWE SCAN AND AUDIT YOUR NETWORK LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT A DATA BREACH COULD OCCUR\\nAuditing your network systems consistently is one of the major ways that your company can stay one step ahead of cyber criminals, by identifying and correcting vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches.\\nThere are a number of methods and protocols that can be used to maintain complete data security. For instance, the SANS Institute released a report of the 20 top critical security controls to use in order to mitigate cyber-threats. CSC1 and CSC2 stress the necessity and importance of having a complete device and application inventory so that all devices and software in use can be identified as either authorized or unauthorized. This simple step can have powerful results in the process of maintaining network security.\\nWhen your company undergoes initial network scanning of devices, ports in use, services running, etc. the baseline report can be set and later used for assessments when further testing is carried out, which can be used to show changes over time. If a new server shows up unexpectedly it can be identified during an audit and compared with the baseline assessment. In another example, a service may be accidentally enabled.\\nA routine audit, in conjunction with keeping an updated inventory, gives your company a complete picture and in-depth view of your corporate network, while providing information on network changes made and revealing all network attack surfaces, which greatly improves security due to knowing where the risks and threats exist.\\nWE CHECK FOR UNPATCHED SYSTEMS AND MISCONFIGURED SERVERS\\nUnpatched systems allow vulnerabilities present in a system to be exploited by cyber-criminals, thus it is of the utmost importance to consistently test your network systems in order to find any potential security holes so that they can be corrected. A myriad of publicly-available security exploits and payloads, matching certain systems and vulnerabilities, is widely available in many hacker communities. In addition to this, misconfigured systems often result in security holes that present an increased attack surface in an IT infrastructure.\\nIt is thus important to identify the necessary services that each network device in your company needs to run, along with the appropriate ports, while also conducting routine audits and using the principle of hardening network systems to disable unnecessary ports and services to reduce your company's attack surface.\\nA system with unnecessary open ports that is also running services and functions that are unneeded (all of which can easily be ascertained by a hacker in the vulnerability and port scanning stages) can present an easy target to an attacker. This can allow sensitive data to escape into public systems in an otherwise secure system.\\nThe best way to know your network is secure is to have us come in and try to penetrate it ourselves, in the same way a would be attacker may try!\"]","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"verification","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":479,"question":"How do marine predators with unusual body proportions adapt to protect themselves from larger predators?","gold":"Marine predators with unusual body proportions have developed various defensive adaptations. In ancient times, the Dinocephalosaurus had a neck nearly twice as long as its body (5.5 feet long), with specialized neck ribs that affected its movement capabilities. Modern creatures like the Atlantic Trumpetfish, despite being up to 3 feet long with an elongated body, have evolved sophisticated defensive strategies. They are poor long-distance swimmers but rely on quick escapes to nearby cover and excellent camouflage skills. They can rapidly change their coloration to blend into backgrounds and use their thin, elongated shape to mimic vertical reef structures like sea whips and gorgonian corals. When threatened, they often float vertically and sway with these structures in the current to avoid detection by predators like groupers, snappers, and sharks.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:d09fe895-bbe6-4603-805b-8b9ba75095d3>', '<urn:uuid:523a2dfd-694c-4c4f-a55c-d135abf5c2fb>']","texts":"[\"WASHINGTON \u2014 Scientists working in China have discovered an ancient swimming predator with a neck nearly twice as long as its body. Neck ribs line the reptile\u2019s 5.5-foot-long (1.7-meter-long) neck and may have helped the creature hunt.\\nThe scientists describe the new predator in Friday's issue of the journal Science, published by AAAS, the nonprofit science society.\\nSome aspects of the animal\u2019s life are relatively easy to reconstruct: It probably ate fish and squid, and lived in a shallow sea more than 230 million years ago. The biggest remaining question about this animal is what purpose such a long neck served.\\nWith bones but no muscles to guide them, the scientists say that it\u2019s hard to be absolutely certain about how the creature used its neck. They have some ideas, however, that relate to hunting.\\nThe new creature, Dinocephalosaurus orientalis or \u201cterrible-headed lizard from the Orient,\u201d is the first fully marine member of a diverse reptile group called the protorosaurs. These reptiles are grouped together based on their long necks and elongated neck vertebrae. Their riblike bones extended parallel to the neck vertebrae and restricted neck movement, like straws that are slid down the neck of a turtleneck sweater.\\nThe scientists compared this new creature to the famous long-necked reptiles and fellow protorosaurs from Europe and the Middle East called Tanystropheus. This comparison offers new insights into the ways protorosaurs hunted, as well as how they evolved and diversified during the Triassic Period.\\nWhile analyzing the new skeleton, Michael LaBarbera, a Science author from the University of Chicago, said he felt Mother Nature directing him to an interesting mystery: The existing explanations for why reptiles have long necks didn\u2019t seem to fit this new predator.\\nOne of the ways the researchers tried to understand the purpose of the new creature\u2019s neck was to look at the long necks of its relatives, like Tanystropheus.\\nThe vertebrae in the necks of Tanystropheus fossils were longer than those in the newly discovered predator. With fewer vertebrae per meter, Tanystropheus necks were probably less flexible than the new reptile\u2019s, in the way that a giraffe\u2019s neck is less flexible than the neck of a heron. The scientists concluded that the necks from these two branches of the protorosaur family tree evolved separately and may have served different functions.\\nTo try to make sense of the reptile\u2019s \u201cridiculous body proportions,\u201d Science author Olivier Rieppel from Chicago's Field Museum and his colleagues considered suction feeding, an underwater hunting strategy commonly used by many of today\u2019s fish and turtles. Fish and turtles drop the floors of their specially designed mouths, increasing volume and decreasing pressure inside their throats. This pressure drop creates a suction force that causes nearby water (and the potential meal swimming in that water) to flow into the predator\u2019s mouth and throat.\\nMore from TODAY.com\\n'You shall not pass!'

Ian McKellen warns students in viral video\\nThe scientists suggest that this suction might have allowed the reptile to swallow invisible pressure waves it created as it lunged forward in the water to try to catch a meal. This move would prevent the waves from alerting the fish or squid to the reptile\u2019s approach.\\nWithout information on how the creature\u2019s muscles attached to the bones, other underwater hunting strategies are also possible.\\nIn a complementary scenario, the sheer length of the neck could have helped the reptile in murky waters near the shore. The long neck placed the reptile\u2019s brain, mouth and sensory organs well in front of its body. This neck design could have made it hard for a fish to see the larger body at the other end of the neck. With this threatening profile hidden, the reptile might have been able to move into striking distance before the fish got scared and swam away.\\nFollow-up in a fish tank\\nWith multiple explanations for the reptile\u2019s long neck and no solid conclusions, the researchers are anxious to find a fossil that tells the story of the reptile\u2019s muscles.\\nIn the meantime, LaBarbera said he might do some experiments in his giant fish tank to try to answer the question, \u201cIs a predator with a long neck better equipped to sneak up on fish than a predator with a short neck?\u201d\\nHe is thinking about submerging predator models with different head shapes and neck lengths in his 90-foot-long, 6-foot-deep, 3-foot-wide (27-by-1.8-by-0.9-meter) glass-walled tank after filling it with goldfish.\\nHe could tow the different models at a fixed speed and monitor the reaction of the fish. He would like to know if head shape or neck length changes the prey-alerting pressure waves the models generate, as he and his colleagues predict.\\nWhile scientists can not yet say for sure exactly how the reptile used its neck, they are sure its long neck was made of 25 elongated neck or \u201ccervical\u201d vertebrae.\\nHumans have only seven cervical vertebrae and no neck ribs. Our first neck vertebra, atlas, begins at the base of the skull. Reach back and feel the bump at the base of the back of your neck; that\u2019s your seventh and final cervical vertebra, \u201cC7.\u201d\\nIf a 6-foot-tall (1.8-meter-tall) person had the same neck-to-body proportions as Dinocephalosaurus, her neck would be approximately 10 feet (3 meters) long.\\n\u00a9 2013 American Association for the Advancement of Science\", 'Atlantic Trumpetfish Aulostomus maculatus\\nSpecies ID: A.AM\\nDescription: A long slender fish with small fins at the rear of the body and a thickelongated snout with a pointed barbel on the lower jaw. These fish can change colour at will, although three basic colour schemes exist: reddish brown, gray with a blue snout, and yellow. Common markings include pale horizontal stripes and dark speckles. Sexes appear similar and juveniles resemble adults\\nMaximum Size: 1 m (3 ft)\\nStatus: Not currently on the IUCN endangered species list\\nAtlantic Trumpetfish & People: May be consumed locally, but not important in commercial fisheries or the aquarium trade\\nGeographical Range: Found throughout the Caribbean, but is more common in the Lesser Antilles (south-east Caribbean)\\nCoral Reef Zone: Found in the back reef and fore reef zones\\nFavourite Habitat: Trumpetfish prefer habitats with vertical structures, such as gorgonian corals, in which they can camouflage themselves\\nDepth: 2-25m (6\u201382ft)\\nA Day in the Life\\nDawn: Found stalking prey on the reef, when the low light augments its natural camouflage and increases hunting success\\nDay: Stalking prey by mimicking vertical structures like sponges and soft corals\\nDusk: Stalking prey, and may also move into the deeper fore reef zone to spawn\\nNight: Found hiding under ledges, or camouflaged next to vertical structures\\nWho Eats Who?\\nTrumpetfish are predators, and consume many small reef creatures, such as shrimps, chromis, wrasses, juvenile grunts and soldierfish. Trumpetfish themselves are vulnerable to a variety of large reef predators like grouper, snapper, jacks, and sharks.\\nScuba Diver & Snorkeler Best Practices\\nRefrain from feeding marine life. Coral reef organisms should never be fed. Although this may seem like a harmless practice that allows you to get close to your favourite organisms, it actually disturbs normal feeding patterns and diets. Scientists have documented turtles being fed bread, dog food and even cheese\u2014none of these foods are found naturally in the marine environment, and they can cause untold stress to the organisms that consume them. Conditioning wild animals to become comfortable with hand-feeding by humans alters their behaviour and makes them more vulnerable to capture, which directly affect their survival\u2014this is particularly a concern for endangered sea turtles.\\nTrumpetfish remain still if they believe they are well camouflaged, but are wary and often move away when snorkelers or divers come too close. A slow, indirect approach is recommended.\\nTrumpetfish are carnivores specialized in the capture of small fishes and, occasionally, small crustaceans. They are generally passive ambush predators which hunt during daylight hours from the concealment of soft corals or from under coral ledges. They lie in wait until the opportunity arises for a lightning-fast strike, curving the rear half of their body into an S shape and rapidly straightening, resulting in a rapid lunge towards the target.\\nThese fish are also known to stalk prey in partnership with other reef fish, using them as moving cover to hide their approach from prey. Interestingly, the Pacific cousins of trumpetfish and cornetfish are natural predators of juvenile red lionfish. The red lionfish is a ravenous carnivore that has recently been introduced into the Caribbean, where populations are growing unchecked in the absence of experienced natural predators. With time, Caribbean trumpetfish and cornetfish may also learn to consume this invasive species and help control their numbers.\\nObserve, record & share:\\nO A.AM-101 \u2013 Stalking: Stalking and striking at prey in the open\\nO A.AM-102 \u2013 Ambush: Striking at unsuspecting prey from a concealed position\\nO A.AM-103 \u2013 Shadow-feeding: Stalking while hiding alongside other reef fish and using them as a mobile cover, thus improving their chances of approaching prey undetected\\nO A.AM-104 \u2013 S-shape: Trumpetfish curve the body into an S-shape before striking at prey\\nAttack & Defense Behaviour\\nTrumpetfish do not defend territories and their main defensive concern is avoiding predators. They are poor long-distance swimmers and rely mainly on a quick escape to nearby cover where they can use their excellent camouflage skills to hide from large predators like snappers and groupers. Trumpetfish can camouflage themselves using their thin, elongated shape to blend into vertical reef features like sea whips, sea plumes, and other gorgonians. They can also change colours rapidly to blend away into the background and avoid being seen.\\nObserve, record & share:\\nO A.AM-201 \u2013 Shape camouflage: When they feel threatened, trumpetfish often imitate gorgonian branches or sponges by floating vertically and swaying with them in the current\\nO A.AM-202 \u2013 Colour camouflage: Trumpetfish can change colour to blend into a new background\\nAlthough spawning has never been scientifically documented in this species, eye-witness accounts suggest that this species practices pelagic broadcast spawning, where males and females rush to the sea surface to release their eggs and sperm, which disperse into the open ocean. Courtship sessions may be interrupted as several males fight over the right to spawn with ripe females, which appear swollen with eggs. Just before spawning, males darken their colour, swim alongside the female, and may hover vertically along with their chosen partner. There is no evidence of sex change in this species. Spawning occurs year-round in the hours just before sunset, although reproductive activity peaks in the winter months from November to January.\\nObserve, record & share:\\nO A.AM-301 \u2013 Ripe female: Females full of eggs, and ready to spawn, have swollen bellies\\nO A.AM-302 \u2013 Male competition: Ripe females are often chased by multiple males, who may fight with each other for exclusive spawning rights\\nO A.AM-303 \u2013 Courtship: Just before spawning, males deepen their colour, and swim alongside or hover vertically with their chosen female\\nO A.AM-304 \u2013 Spawning rush: Following ripe females at a distance may increase the chances of witnessing spawning, during which males rise with females high above the reef where eggs and sperm are released simultaneously\\nShadow-feeding: Trumpetfish prefer to shadow other reef fish species (often herbivorous species) the same colour as themselves, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their camouflage. Thus, yellow individuals prefer to shadow other yellow fish such as Spanish hogfish; reddish brown individuals prefer to shadow grouper and darker parrotfish; and dull grey individuals with blue snouts prefer to blend in with schools of blue fish such as blue tang,blue chromis, and creole wrasse, where their snouts are mistaken for a member of the school Occasionally, trumpetfish may even attempt to shadow a diver!\\nDid You Know?\\n\u2022 Eels, snapper, and grouper are all predators of trumpetfish, and some of the shorterbodied predators often succeed in consuming trumpetfish longer than they are by folding this awkward prey over in their stomachs\\n\u2022 The fantastic range of yellow, brown and red colour patterns that trumpetfish use for camouflage is produced by controlling the concentration of pigments in specialized cells called chromatophores. In contrast, blue colours are achieved by small shiny particles that reflect blue light, rather than by pigments.

{"id":549,"question":"why do some file systems normalize file names differently","gold":"Different operating systems and file systems normalize file names in various ways due to their distinct handling of character cases. For example, FAT and EXFAT systems always convert filenames to uppercase, while NTFS and Apple's HFS Plus preserve case when storing files but are case insensitive when retrieving them. Additionally, systems handle Unicode characters differently - HFS Plus always normalizes file names to a fully decomposed form, while Windows treats filenames as opaque character sequences and stores them exactly as provided. These differences can lead to file management issues and potential data loss when sharing files across different systems.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:8c65f498-2b4f-4dbf-87d3-1f122e2beb8e>']","texts":"['How to name a file: Interoperability considerations\u00b6\\nOne of the most fundamental data management tasks is naming files.\\nThis may sound mundane to some \u2014 \u201cyeah, I guess I can\u2019t manage data if it doesn\u2019t have a file name, but what\u2019s the big deal? I already know that I shouldn\u2019t use spaces in file names\u201d. Other people take it to the edge of bikeshedding and beyond: \u201cLet\u2019s start each file name with the ISO 8601 date format of its first modification for better sorting!\u201d But between the two extremes, there are a surprising amount of interoperability considerations \u2014 practices and tips to ensure cross-platform compatibility \u2014 in order to create file names that work on your own as well as on anyone else\u2019s machine.\\nThis matters because the files, directories, or repositories that you may at some point share with friends, colleagues, or the entire internet should successfully make it to those other people\u2019s computers, and on those computers they should be usable for their intended purpose. As you will see in some examples below, having a completely fail-safe file name is the first step in ensuring this. Coincidentally, a short deep-dive into interoperability hacks for file names will probably also teach you some fascinating facts about your own or other operating systems, file systems, or common tools that you may not have known yet.\\nOh no, normalization!\u00b6\\nDifferent operating systems, file systems, or tools normalize names given to files, and this can go wrong in many ways:\\nDon\u2019t create files that differ only in case\u00b6\\nWhile many Unix systems save file names exactly as provided, and are able to differentiate between\\nExample.txt, this won\u2019t work on other systems.\\nFilesystems such as File Allocation Table (FAT) or Extended File Allocation Table (EXFAT) always convert filenames to uppercase:\\nexample.txt will be stored as\\nEXAMPLE.TXT, as will\\nThat\u2019s really bad news if you were to share a folder filled with\\nexample.txt files with different casing variations from your Linux computer with a USB stick.\\nBut also if you happen to have both a\\nREADME and a\\nreadme file in your directory, or save important observations from scientific field work on mating bonobos in capital-cased files for females and lower-cased files for males.\\nNew Technology File System (NTFS) and Apple\u2019s Hierarchical File System (HFS) Plus, on the other hand, usually preserve case when storing files, but are case insensitive when retrieving them.\\nA file saved as\\nExample.txt will be retrieved by that name but will also be retrieved as\\nIf you are on a Mac, chances are high that you can fascinate your friends1 with these simple magic tricks:\\nme@mymac ~ % touch a A me@mymac ~ % ls -l a A -rw-r--r-- 1 me staff 0 Aug 31 13:06 A -rw-r--r-- 1 me staff 0 Aug 31 13:06 a me@mymac ~ % rm a me@mymac ~ % ls -l a A ls: A: No such file or directory ls: a: No such file or directory *flying doves* me@mymac ~ % touch a A me@mymac ~ % ls -l a A -rw-r--r-- 1 me staff 0 Aug 31 13:06 A -rw-r--r-- 1 me staff 0 Aug 31 13:06 a me@mymac ~ % echo 123 > a me@mymac ~ % ls -l a A -rw-r--r-- 1 me staff 4 Aug 31 13:06 A -rw-r--r-- 1 me staff 4 Aug 31 13:06 a me@mymac ~ % cat A 123 *rabbit emerges from hat*\\nIf you can, try to avoid trouble with unicode\u00b6\\nLucky are the people with boring names without accents and special characters. The others may have an extra bit of fun in their lives when software can not handle their names.\\nEven though certain names look identical across file systems or operating systems, their underlying unicode character sequences can differ. For example, the character \u201c\u00e9\u201d can be represented as the single Unicode character u+00E9 (latin small letter e with acute), or as the two Unicode characters u+0065 and u+0301 (the letter \u201ce\u201d plus a combining acute symbol). This is called canonical equivalence and can be confusing: While file names are visually indistinguishable, certain tools, operating systems, or file systems can normalize their underlying unicode differently and cause errors in the process. It becomes a problem, potentially even leading to permanent data loss, when one tool or filesystem won\u2019t recognize a file anymore that has been normalized by a different tool or filesystem.\\nApple\u2019s HFS Plus filesystem always normalizes file names to a fully decomposed form. \u201c\u00e9\u201d would be represented as two Unicode characters u+0065 and u+0301, in that order. Windows treats filenames as opaque character sequences and will store and return the encoded bytes exactly as provided. Linux and other common Unix systems are generally similar to Windows in storing and returning opaque byte streams, but this behavior is technically dependent on the filesystem. And utilities used for file management, transfer, and archiving may ignore this issue, apply an arbitrary normalization form, or allow the user to control how normalization is applied. Having special characters in your file names thus is a bit like a data management version of russian roulette. Most things will likely be fine, but at some point, with some tool, sharing to some system, things could just blow up.\\nIllegal in certain systems\u00b6\\nWhile normalization differences between systems may make it impossible to disambiguate different files or cause different representations of identical files, there are also file names that aren\u2019t allowed. And places that ban certain file names will not be able to create, receive, or use such such files.\\nAvoid illegal characters\u00b6\\nDifferent operating systems disallow certain characters in file names, and things will be messy if you were to share a file with a character that works on your machine with a machine that regards it as illegal. Let\u2019s start easy, and with characters that you can actually find on your keyboard\u2026\\nOn Unix systems, the forward slash\\n\/ can not be used in file names.\\nThis is because this character is used to denote directory boundaries.\\nOn Windows systems, on the other hand, there is quite a long list of characters:\\n< (less than) > (greater than) : (colon) \" (double quote) \/ (forward slash) \\\\ (backslash) | (vertical bar or pipe) ? (question mark) * (asterisk)\\nAnd in addition, its also not possible to end a file name with a period (\\n.) or a space on Windows.\\nEspecially Unix users can thus inadvertently create files that a Windows system couldn\u2019t handle. But in the case of files with illegal names being committed into Git repositories, the consequences are actually more severe than just a single file that can\u2019t be used or copied. A dataset with a file with invalid characters likely fails to be cloned, because a checkout of that file will fail. If a file with an invalid character exists on the non-default branch, then that branch likely can\u2019t be checked out. So while having invalid characters in your files is 1) a considerably convoluted way of keeping a Git repository private from that one co-worker who uses Windows, it is mostly 2) a major interoperability hassle, even more so in the context of version control.\\nWhat about file names with \u201cinvisible\u201d characters?\\nThere are also illegal characters that you can\u2019t find on your keyboard: Control characters.\\nThose are characters that do not represent written symbols, but cause particular actions on a system.\\nThe ASCII code 7 (bell), for example, can cause the device to emit a warning.\\nOn Unix systems, its illegal to use the 0 (NUL) control character in a file name.\\nOn Windows systems, its also illegal to use any control character between\\nRelevant in the case that, you know, you wanted to have a file with non-printable characters.\\nWhy not, right?\\nAvoid illegal file names\u00b6\\nWindows has the fun concept of reserved file names, which are names that referred to system actions or devices in OS versions predating current versions of Windows. These names are\\nCON (used to access the computer console) PRN (used to print) AUX (used to access auxiliary devices) NUL (a special file that discards data written to it, often used to hide output) COM1-COM9 (serial communication ports) LPT1-LPT9 (parallel ports)\\nJust like with illegal characters, any file with those names, or any repository that includes a file with those names, will be an interoperability issue for Windows users, and Linux users should thus be mindful not to use those file names2.\\nImpossibilities and inconveniences\u00b6\\nYou already know that you could create a file name with only control characters on Linux systems, but shouldn\u2019t do so to ensure interoperability. Here are more examples on how to be nice to the system that receives your files:\\nKeep file names below 260 characters\u00b6\\nIf you want to annoy a foe with a Windows-based machine, or convince a Windows-friend to switch to Unix, send them files that exceed Windows\u2019 (default) maximum path length limitation of 260 characters, or make them copy files with acceptable length into a too long, nested directory hierarchy3. This limit exists for all machines running Windows before Windows 10 version 1607, and for all later versions of Windows if the maximum path limit has not been manually removed in the settings. For more gotchas that Windows users may run into, take a look at the section So\u2026 Windows\u2026 eh?.\\nPrevent paths to be interpreted as command line arguments\u00b6\\nWhile it\u2019s not \u201cillegal\u201d to start a directory of file name with a hyphen (\\n-), it\u2019s a bad idea, and doing so is disallowed by certain tools due to security risks.\\nIn theory, a file name starting with a hyphen can clash with a command line argument, and a tool called to operate on that file may then misinterpret it as an argument name.\\nIf you were to create a file called\\n-n on a Unix system, an\\ncat on this file (unless you would add a\\n.\/ prefix to indicate a file in the current directory) would behave different than expected, parametrizing the command line tool instead of displaying any file information.\\nBecause this can be a security hazard, for example leading to remote code execution, Git will refuse to operate on submodules that start with a hyphen (CVE-2018-17456).\\nWhile it is technically not illegal, try to keep the\\n% symbol out of file names.\\nTools that try to handle a name with it may mistake it as an escape urlencoded sequence and behave unpredictably.\\nMuch information and some general structure of this page is taken from RFC 8493.

These architects identified that some of the most prominent attributes were spaces that strengthen interactions, communication, and collaboration, as well as spaces that are open, transparent and contextually responsive.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:34c56c90-0cfc-4ac7-938b-bbd5eecc7002>']","texts":"['The Innovation Lab: A Guide\\n\u201cInnovation labs,\u201d \u201cinnovation centres,\u201d \u201cinnovation spaces\u201d\u2014you might have heard one of these buzzwords lately. Large corporates all around the world are creating their own spaces for innovation. Some take the format of flashy exhibition spaces on blockchain technology, while others are housed in a coworking space for startup collaborators to exchange ideas.\\nDo corporates need innovation spaces? First and foremost, many companies fear being \u201cuberised\u201d and realise that they need to continuously upgrade in order to stay relevant. With the rise of disruptive tech startups, corporates feel the pressure to create new products and keep up with the latest trends to avoid becoming obsolete. In the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen high-profile examples of companies who suffered the consequences of falling behind. Toys R Us, and most recently Sears, are large brands who went bankrupt in the face of e-commerce and new players in the retail space.\\nThe underlying challenge to innovation isn\u2019t that large companies lack good ideas. The problem is that the path from innovation to roll-out in the \u201creal world\u201d is not easy. In large corporates, current organisational frameworks, inefficient communication, and rigid processes make it difficult for them to pivot. If the success of an innovation project rests on better communication and a stronger sense of ownership among relevant stakeholders, then the physical space surely has an important role to play.\\nThis is where innovation spaces come in handy. Innovation spaces avoid organisational roadblocks because they are often separated from a company\u2019s main headquarters. Moreover, these spaces enable corporates to collaborate with new startups, expand industry their networks, as well as generate new products and business ideas.\\nThe \u201cright\u201d innovation space is different for each company. There seems to be as many approaches as there are companies, as documented in an article about 10 different innovation labs in Singapore. For corporates just starting out on their innovation journey, it can be difficult to know where to start. Businesses should think carefully about their goals before spending to fit-out their \u201cown\u201d innovation space.\\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll take you through the benefits of innovation labs, the forms they can take, and the basic steps for putting them into practice.\\nWhat are the benefits of an innovation space?\\nOne of the questions you might be considering is: why bother setting up a separate space for innovation? Can\u2019t I just innovate in-house with what I have? While the latter is possible, it can be very difficult. Even the idea of innovation can threaten in-house teams who run on traditional, long-held processes. By definition, innovation is disruptive, so existing members of the company might be hesitant to embrace drastic changes to the way they do work. In light of cross-generational struggles, up-and-coming corporate innovators are more likely to encounter roadblocks from within and lack the freedom to experiment with new ideas. Ultimately, a complete change of scenery is crucial for people to think and behave differently.\\nLet\u2019s look at a scenario. What if Toys R Us set up immersive \u201cexperience\u201d stores? Beyond housing the latest products, these new stores could showcase renderings of toys being manufactured or even have digital pop-up booths for customers to \u2018customise\u2019 or make their own toys! In this case, innovation spaces would be used to engage with consumers and strengthen the brand. If Toys R Us took the chance to innovate its spaces, would its story be different today?\\nHere are the key benefits of starting an innovation lab:\\n1. An innovation lab signals a safe place for trial and error and learning.\\nAn innovation lab can override this tension between \u201cthe old\u201d and the new by being entirely separate from the operations of its parent organization. These two groups have different goals and KPIs during \u201cinnovation time.\u201d Innovators, both from inside and outside the organization, feel safe to build on ideas without clashing with existing processes or traditions. Likewise, the innovation space does not adhere to strict corporate processes, and this freedom give members permission to fully engage in the discovery process.\\n2. Innovation space = collaboration.\\nInnovation is at its best when there is diversity of talent, skills, experiences and views. It is about \u201cco-creating\u201d with input from interdisciplinary skill sets. Businesses understand that successful innovation rarely takes place in silos. Innovation labs can be the perfect setting for people across different teams, or departments, and even levels in an organization to find common ground and inspiration for new creations. Innovators from different departments are needed to create a full solution for their clients.\\nThe paradox is that with huge advancements in digital technology, face-to-face communication becomes even more important than ever before. Research shows that when more complex information is being communicated, people value face-to-face interaction over remote communication.\\nInnovation spaces should enable these productive conversations to take place. The best innovation spaces provide an open design that allows users or participants to create and mould the space needed for different stages of innovation and activity.\\nWhat should my innovation program include?\\nThis brings us to the fundamentals: what should go in to an innovation program to begin with? The execution can vary depending on the type of space you choose, but the basic principles can be understood with four pillars: Purpose, People, Place and Program.\\n1. Purpose: What are my strategic goals? What innovation challenges or threats am I addressing?\\nIdentifying the larger purpose behind innovation is the first and most important step. A banking company, for example, may find their overall goal to increase transparency in their clients\u2019 transactions with the help of digital technology. These 1-2 overarching missions will inform the kind of networks and innovation clusters your business should reach out to.\\n2. People: Which networks of people should I reach out to? Who are the people I should appoint as \u201ctechnology connectors?\u201d\\nAt the heart of every innovation space are people \u2013 startups, government organisations, researchers, and SMEs. In general, you should be on the lookout for innovators who could: (1) threaten to disrupt your business (2) help your business enter and disrupt new, adjacent markets or (3) help you introduce new products or services.\\nTo find these networks, we recommended that you appoint well-connected leaders in your organization who have a strong understanding of your strategic goals. Identify leads who have a growth mindset and see obstacles or failures as opportunities for learning. Rule out the self-promoters who do not prioritise the interests of your business. If chosen well, these \u201ctechnology connectors\u201d should be well-equipped to find and recruit the right innovators for your business.\\n3. Place: What type of space is required for effective collaboration with these networks I identified? Where should this space be located?\\nHaving a physical location can go a long way in fostering collaboration and enabling the face-to-face exchange of complex ideas. We recommend that your first innovation lab, at least, should be housed outside of your company\u2019s headquarters to prevent conflict with internal corporate traditions. The experience of a new, external space is conducive towards innovation, which is all about ushering in the new to bring about evolution. The innovation lab doesn\u2019t have to be anything too fancy\u2014in fact, a customised meeting room might do the trick for some businesses. A change of scenery can go a long way in reinforcing the creativity and excitement involved in coming up with new ideas. Nonetheless, the space should still be reasonably close by and accessible for the innovators and partners in your target networks.\\n4. Program\/Product: What are the specific innovation tasks or projects that lead to my larger strategic goals? How do these relate to the rest of my business?\\nNow that you\u2019ve set up your space and tapped into your relevant connections, it\u2019s time to get your hands dirty! For some businesses it\u2019s sufficient to simply gather these like minded people in one space to brainstorm, exchange ideas, and work together. Others, especially tech companies, are looking to translate these ideas into actual products. Before productising your solution, you should set up a product development team and answer the following questions:\\n- How will management support the innovation initiative? Would you have a budget?\\n- How will this new product answer a particular business problem or potential threats in the horizon? Is there product-market fit?\\n- Where will this new product fit in the existing business portfolio? Does it align with an existing business model or would it be a whole new unit on its own?\\nApart from productising solutions, other innovation programs can include accelerator programs and mentorship networks, albeit at a hefty price. Large corporates may be able to afford and justify the costs of external programs. The benefit of having an established group run the program is the exposure to a wider network of alumni and experiences. On the other hand, some corporates have chosen to purchase entrepreneurial curriculums to run themselves. In this way, they can both benefit from the learning process as well as have closer touchpoints with potential startups, entrepreneurs, and external innovators.\\nHow to set up an innovation space?\\nThere is no one definition of an effective innovation space. Some MNCs create customised spaces in warehouses or garages far away from their head office. Others simply take a standard conference room and enhance it with state-of-the-art technology and equipment. In one report, 50+ office architects were interviewed regarding the trends that they see in contemporary innovation spaces. Some of the most prominent attributes were \u201cspaces that strengthen interactions, communication, and collaboration; and spaces that are open, transparent and contextually responsive.\u201d In other words, the primary focus of any good innovation lab is enabling effective communication.\\nWhat also sets these spaces apart from the average meeting room or workspace is the use of technology. Depending on your business, this technology could include anything from interactive smart TVs to smart screens to 3D printers for design. The Microsoft Technology Centre (MTC), for example, is equipped with high-end interactive technology to impress visitors and attract third-party developers to collaborate with them. Nonetheless, innovation spaces do not have to be flashy or stocked with expensive equipment. There are cases where innovation labs fall into the trap of simply being an \u201cinnovation theatre,\u201d i.e., an \u201cinnovation lab\u201d that looks great but fails due to the lack of a concrete strategy or purpose.\\nWhile this list is not exhaustive, here are some tools commonly included in effective innovation labs across different industries. All of these items are geared towards strengthening communication, creativity and collaboration within the space:\\n- Wall-to-wall whiteboards\\n- Movable partitions between rooms or sections\\n- Noise reduction felt for private rooms or phone booths\\n- Plants and breakout spaces\\n- Warm lighting\\n- Well-stocked pantry\\n- Sufficient storage space\\n- Projector and screen\\n- Video conferencing equipment\\n- WiFi and wireless connectivity for displays\\n- Flipcharts and markers\\n- Shared, adjustable workstations\\n- Adjustable sit-standing desks\\n- Plenty of electrical plugs\\nLayout and design\\nBeyond equipment, spatial design is crucial in fostering a collaborative environment. Open layouts are especially common in innovation labs, encouraging movement and mixing across disciplines. To nurture a culture of creativity, it might also help to add interactive displays, whiteboards, open carpeted spaces, couches \u2013 and even bean bags!\\nUltimately, the most successful innovation spaces are often flexible and multi-purpose. Design the layout with a wide range of activities to consider: brainstorming sessions, skills workshops, product development, sit-down work, presentations etc. With built-in flexibility, the space allows different disciplines to converge and make the most out of the lab.\\nWhen planning your innovation space, it\u2019s good practice to devise a floor space plan. The layout of a lab dedicated to product prototyping may be very different from one primarily geared towards brainstorming. A standard innovation space would normally be designed for one, a few or all of the following functions:\\n- Brainstorming sessions (high space density): all seating is clustered closely and oriented towards presentation materials for effective discussion.\\n- Prototyping workshop (low space density): a specialised space for tech\/manufacturing businesses. A warehouse or garage can be used to ensure there is enough space for equipment and individual workstations. Seats should be spaced apart and do not need to face one another.\\n- Meetings (medium\/high space density): a formal space for setting agendas, strategizing, reviewing, and making conference calls, among other things. All seats must be facing one another and set around a common table.\\n- Office space (medium space density): to foster collaboration, workstations should ideally be shared in breakout areas or facing one another in private offices.\\nInnovation spaces can take on diverse purposes and shapes, and there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all rule. The only guideline to keep in mind is that an innovation lab must be a safe and open space for innovation to take off\u2014\u201csafe\u201d for businesses to innovate without clashing with an organization\u2019s traditions, and \u201copen\u201d for exploration and discovery.\\nWe have observed some corporates making the mistake of being too heavily outcome-oriented without putting enough emphasis on the discovery process. Specific goals and directions can really only be established after businesses explore the resources and connections they have. In most cases, businesses feel the threat of uberisation, but aren\u2019t quite sure what exactly is threatening them. As such, the discovery process of innovation is crucial to helping businesses identify their pain points and come up with the right solutions.\\nWhen planning an innovation strategy, it\u2019s important to consider the type of space you require.

The whole process is quite complex but can roughly be explained by breaking it down into two coupled effects: gravity and chemical reactions. Gravity causes the water to infiltrate through discrete fractures (hard rocks) or pores (sedimentary rocks), until it charges the groundwater supply below to a point where excess water will surface on the face of the rock, like an overflowing glass of water. Chemical reactions, on the other hand, allow water to dissolve carbonates and similar substances present in the rock. Such chemical compounds will start sticking and accumulating on the surface.\\nWhite stripes due to discrete fractures in the rocks\\nat Halibut Point State Park, Cape Ann, MA, United States.\\nWater Flowing Through Rocks\\nThe phenomena of water flowing through rocks can be witnessed in nature, such as in the Halibut Point State Park in Cape Ann, MA (shown above). These rocks are made of 400+ year-old layers of granite, one of the most common types of rock, named for its granular texture. As you can see in the picture, the flux of water in those rocks is visible on their surface, giving way to streaks of a lighter color on their surface. The free flow of fluids through a fracture, in a block of solid or porous media, is what\u2019s called a discrete fracture.\\nSimulating Discrete Fracture\\nIf you are interested in simulating discrete fractures, you can use COMSOL Multiphysics together with the Subsurface Flow Module. In fact, our Model Gallery features a great Discrete Fracture documented example. The image below to the left shows the geometry used in this model, which consists of two blocks sharing a common interior boundary representing the discrete fracture. To the right you can see the analysis of time-dependent flow in the fractured porous blocks after 1000 seconds.\\n|Geometry of the discrete fracture.||Analysis of time-dependent flow after 1000 s.|\\nThe two blocks are made of porous media, while the shared interior boundary represents a discrete fracture. The Darcy\u2019s law physics interface is used to solve both the porous media flow and the fracture flow. The fracture is represented as an interior boundary, meaning Darcy\u2019s law is solved on the surface instead of in a volume by adding the Fracture Flow feature to the Darcy\u2019s law interface. Doing so avoids creating a very thin domain representing the fracture that would lead to a dense mesh consisting of very small elements.

Non-breeding (wintering) areas are located in southwestern Africa (Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa), parts of central Africa (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and parts of western Africa (Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\\'Ivoire, and Ghana). Generally, African fish eagles can be found between the latitudes of 17\u00b0N and 35\u00b0S. Adults are usually sedentary, but may move about locally in response to changing environmental conditions such as drought, flooding events, or changes in food supply. (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2005)\\nAfrican fish eagles are found primarily along bodies of water throughout sub-Saharan Africa; these include rivers, lakes, floodplains, coasts, estuaries, mangrove lagoons, and swamps. African fish eagles also frequent stocked dams and alkaline lakes. Individuals have been observed at elevations up to 4000 m. However, they usually remain under an elevation of 1500 m. (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2005)\\nAdult African fish eagles are large, readily recognizable raptors, with their pure white head, neck, chest, and tail, dark chestnut brown body, and black primaries and secondaries. They have broad, rather long wings (wingspan from 175 to 210 cm), and a fairly short, rounded tail. The face is largely bare and yellow, as is the cere; the eyes are dark, and the feet are yellow. The mass of an adult African fish eagle ranges from 2.1 to 3.6 kg and the length can range from 63 to 77 cm. Females are larger and bulkier (about 10 to 15%) than males, and African fish eagles tend to be slightly larger in the southern parts of Africa. (Brown, 1980; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2005; Hollamby, et al., 2004)\\nJuveniles are quite different than adults; their plumage is mostly brown, with white feathers scattered throughout in no particular pattern. They have white patches on the chest, base of the tail, and primary bases, and the face is dull grayish. The tail also tends to be longer in juveniles than in adults. (Brown, 1980; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2005)\\nAfrican fish eagles are monogamous and most often mate for life. Breeding is seasonal, and both sexes participate in nest building, incubation, and rearing of chicks. (Brown, 1970; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001)\\nThere have been instances of non-breeding pairs of African fish eagles, with no reasons attributed to this behavior. (Brown, 1960)\\nAfrican fish eagles breed once yearly, with breeding seasons varying according to where the African fish eagles reside. Along the equator, breeding can occur most months. In southern Africa, April through October is the typical breeding season, where it is June through December for coastal eastern Africa and October through April for western Africa. (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001)\\nUsually two eggs are laid, but clutch sizes ranging from one to four eggs have been observed. If there is more than one egg per clutch, they are usually laid 2-3 days apart, and usually only 1 chick survives as a result of siblicide. Young hatch between 42 and 45 days, and fledge between 64 and 75 days. African fish eagles are usually independent from their parents after 6 to 8 weeks post-fledging. It has been said that only 5% of African fish eagle young reach adulthood. (Brown, 1960; Brown, 1970; Brown, 1980; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001)\\nAfrican fish eagles usually construct one to three nests in tall trees near waterways; nest are commonly built in acacias, smooth-barked trees, or euphorbias. Both sexes participate in nesting behavior. Nests usually have a diameter of 120-150 cm and a depth of 30-60 cm (but can be as big as 200 cm in diameter and 150 cm deep). Nests are lined with grass, leaves, papyrus, reed, and sometimes even weaver nests. Both sexes participate in incubation and rearing of chicks; females primarily incubate and shade the chicks whereas the male does most of the hunting for his mate and offspring. Adults may continue to feed offspring for an additional six weeks post fledging. (Brown, 1960; Brown, 1970; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001)\\nAfrican fish eagles are diurnal. They are often observed in pairs perched on mostly horizontal branches that are near to or overhanging a body of water. Most of their time is spent surveying the area, and they spend less than 10 minutes per day fishing, except when raising young. (Brown, 1980; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001)\\nCourtship displays in African fish eagles include aerial diving, swooping, and calling. In some instances, the pair will lock talons and perform a whirling dive together. (Brown, 1960)\\nDuring times of extreme food concentration or food scarcity, the density of African fish eagles can reach high numbers. Juveniles have been observed in groups of 30 around fisheries. (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001)\\nBreeding pairs hold an average territory size of 1.1 km along the shoreline of a freshwater lake and an average territory size of 3.4 km along a river shoreline. Immature fish eagles, which are often out-competed intra-specifically for shoreline territories, may occupy an area of 5 sq km in shrubby grassland. Density of African fish eagles usually reflects available perches and amount of food resources. (Krueger, 1997)\\nAfrican fish eagles communicate vocally with members of the same species or other avian competitors to establish and maintain territories. When calling, whether perched or in flight, they throw the head back and give loud, far-carrying, distinctive calls that sound like \u201cWeeah kyow-kow-kow.\u201d Male African fish eagles tend to have higher pitched calls than females. (Brown, 1960; Brown, 1980; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2005; Krueger, 1997)\\nDuets between a breeding pair are often heard. Duetting is more common at the start of the breeding season and facilitates a close bond between the pair. (Brown, 1960; Brown, 1970; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2005)\\nLike other eagle species, African fish eagles will display or call when under threat from solicitors or intruders. African fish eagles perceive their environment through visual, auditory, tactile and chemical stimuli. (Brown, 1960)\\nAfrican fish eagles\u2019 primary food source, as the name implies, is fish. An individual may consume half a pound of fish per day. Common fish species preyed upon include tilapia (Oreochromis esculentus), catfish (Clarius), lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), tigerfish, and mullet, all of which are captured along the water\u2019s surface. Aquatic birds such as cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), grebes, darters (Anhinga melanogaster rufa), and hatchlings of herons and egrets (Ardea alba, Bubulcus ibis, Ardea intermedia) may also become prey to fish eagles. They also hunt flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor, Phoenicopterus ruber) in alkaline lakes, where abundance of fish is limited. Rarely, they will hunt terrestrial mammalian prey such as hyraxes or monkeys, reptile prey such as crocodile hatchlings, terrapins, or monitor lizards, or amphibians such as bullfrogs. (Brown, 1960; Brown, 1970; Brown, 1980; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Green, 2009; Harper, et al., 2002)\\nTypical foraging by African fish eagles involves soaring followed by diving to the water\u2019s surface to catch fish with their talons. It often requires several attempts before a successful catch occurs, with only one in 7 to 8 attempts ending in success. Only fish up to 2 kg can be easily lifted away; anything larger is usually dragged to land and then consumed. (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Green, 2009)\\nAfrican fish eagles have been known to steal food from other predatory birds such as hammerkops (Scopus umbretta), kingfishers, pelicans (Pelecanus), herons, and other birds of prey, such as osprey (Pandion haliaetus) or other fish eagles. African fish eagles may also hunt or scavenge terrestrial prey; however when terrestrial hunting does occur, it is likely due to the eagle\u2019s immaturity. (Brown, 1960; Brown, 1970; Green, 2009; Harper, et al., 2002)\\nSnakes and Nile monitors (Varanus niloticus) have been known to prey upon the eggs of African fish eagles. African fish eagle parents will also guard against monkeys and baboons, but tend to not be concerned about nearby humans. (Brown, 1970; Sumba, 1988)\\nAfrican fish eagles are a tertiary predator in their ecosystem, at the top of the food chain. (Hollamby, et al., 2006)\\nAfrican fish eagles prey upon many species such as catfish and cormorants that are other major predators of young or small fish. This in turn has a positive effect on the fishing industry for the region. (Brown, 1970)\\nAs top carnivore, the African fish eagle is commonly a reference to the health of an aquatic ecosystem, since anything happening at lower levels of the food web will affect the fish eagle through biomagnification. Ecologists, conservationists, and fish farmers can evaluate the strength of a fish eagle population to establish fish crop population, pollution in the waterways, and habitat alteration, since each of these factors will have a more dramatic effect on top carnivores.\\nThe diet of African fish eagle is comprised mainly of fish, some of which are reintroduced or farmed for commercial fishing or fish farming. They have also been known to prey upon the catch of fishermen, ranging from less than .4% to as much as 1% of the total catch. Since many Africans live in poverty, these losses can be detrimental to them. (Cooke and Wilde, 2007; Eltringham, 1975)\\nThe estimated current population size is 300,000. However the species remains common and widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, in suitable habitat. (Butchart, et al., 2009)\\nEcologically, African fish eagle populations are negatively impacted by limited fish sources, land changes in terms of perching or nesting trees near waterways, and aquatic vegetation changes that alter fishing practices of the eagle. Pesticides and other pollutants may also pose a threat to African fish eagles through biomagnification. Eggshell-thinning due to a buildup of organochlorine pesticides (from fish) may begin to cause problems in some parts of its range.

Initially, cells were viewed primarily through their structural components - the cell membrane regulating substance movement, organelles performing specific functions, and the nucleus controlling cellular activities. This has evolved into understanding sophisticated regulatory mechanisms where cells communicate through intricate pathways. These pathways can involve various steps including G-protein activation, enzyme cascades like phospholipase C activation, second messenger production (such as cAMP and IP3), and ultimately cellular responses like protein phosphorylation or gene transcription.

It can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, with prokaryotic cells lacking a nucleus and eukaryotic cells containing a distinct membrane-bound nucleus. Cells perform vital functions like metabolism, growth, and reproduction, and they work together to form tissues and organs in complex organisms.\\nHow do cells reproduce?\\nCell reproduction, or cell division, occurs through two main processes: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the common form of cell division, producing genetically identical daughter cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. Meiosis, on the other hand, is specific to sexual reproduction, resulting in the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells) with half the normal chromosome number.\\nWhat are organelles in a cell?\\nOrganelles are specialized structures within a eukaryotic cell that carry out specific functions. Some crucial organelles include the nucleus, responsible for housing DNA, mitochondria for energy production, endoplasmic reticulum for protein synthesis, and Golgi apparatus for protein modification and packaging. Lysosomes are involved in waste disposal, while vacuoles store various substances.\\nHow do cells obtain energy?\\nCells obtain energy through cellular respiration, a process that occurs in mitochondria. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen react to produce carbon dioxide, water, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of cells. ATP is then utilized to power various cellular activities, allowing cells to carry out essential functions and maintain life.\\nHow do cells communicate?\\nCells communicate through complex signaling pathways, including chemical signals and receptor interactions. These signals can be local or long-distance, influencing cell behavior, growth, and development. Cell communication is vital for coordinating various processes in multicellular organisms, such as immune responses, tissue repair, and hormonal regulation.

It's also cost-effective with a pay-per-use model where you only pay for actual code execution time. However, it has limitations compared to container-based systems: serverless computing may not be suitable for large, complex applications that exceed what AWS or Azure can handle, and it offers no control over how the system is run since it's managed by a third party. Container-based systems provide more flexibility and control, allowing applications to be as large and complex as needed, and may be necessary for certain security and policy requirements.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:c2b86253-75e6-4431-92e9-dec636967d1f>', '<urn:uuid:8e8c4e5f-acef-4f2c-9a91-218de5e81c98>']","texts":"['Serverless Computing: Will Amazon Lambda Be a Game Changer?\\nCloud computing (Amazon Lambda) has changed the game for system administrators.\\nOnce upon a time there were physical boxes, one for each sever. Then there was a physical box that hosted many \u201cvirtual\u201d servers. Then there were hosted servers in the cloud with no boxes. All the servers, regardless of the server environment, ran the same software and served the same function. They all had to be maintained by experts and kept patched, monitored, and secure.\\nBut now, some of those environments are going away all together. Instead of maintaining a server to use for running your applications, Amazon AWS will take care of all the administrative work for you, and simply allow you to input code. Lambda runs the code for you on an environment they manage. You never have to patch, backup, or monitor the environment. You don\u2019t even have to provision the server beforehand; Lambda does it for you. This has led to a new acronym: FaaS, or Function-as-a-Service.\\nWhat\u2019s Amazon Lambda?\\nAWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform. You give it code, it runs the application for you. This saves countless hours of infrastructure support. But that\u2019s not all. As we will see later, it also utilizes a cost-effective pay-per-use model. You don\u2019t pay for server time when your code isn\u2019t running.\\nA colleague of ours works for a biotech startup that engineers microbes that make useful molecules. Their approach brings together technology, automation, and biology with the most sophisticated capabilities in each. A common daily task is analyzing the results of thousands of trials.\\nA typical analysis involves examination of 1,000 trials. The team found that each trial analysis required about 10 seconds of CPU time. A complete analysis of all trials took about 10,000 seconds. This means that after uploading the trials and data samples and triggering the system to run, the results would not be known for almost three hours.\\nA software engineer had an idea to use AWS Lambda After initial setup of the service, he wrote a few lines of code that detailed the algorithm and sample size. Lambda proceeded to set up 1,000 instances, so that each trial analysis would run in its own instance, in parallel. The same ten seconds was needed for each trial analysis, BUT since they were running the analyses in parallel, the total process time was under a minute.\\nDo you want to guess how much it cost? \u2026 40 cents!\\nNot only did it save time, but it saved money. It saved hours of time maintaining the environment and down time for the system. It saved labor costs for programmers, planning, maintaining, upgrading, backing up, duplicating, and securing.\\nThis is one example of how FaaS can benefit any organization running custom applications. While there\u2019s no catch line for Lambda, it could be something like \u201cUpload and run anything in seconds, no headaches, results guaranteed.\u201d\\nPaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is already well established. An organization can go to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM or another platform provider and provision servers; there are fewer compelling reasons to directly maintain servers. Boxes are nearly gone, who thought environments would be next?\\nThe future looks to be cloud-based computing for all your needs. We\u2019ve already seen applications such as CRM and email be supplanted by Software-as-a-Service offerings. Organizations are increasingly using PaaS to quickly provision servers on an as-needed basis. With FaaS, the future seems to be serverless functions for all computing needs. It\u2019s much cheaper, much faster, much easier, much more reliable and much more secure than trying to use systems you control.', 'What is serverless computing? The idea is growing in popularity, but the term honestly sounds like an oxymoron. How does it work, and why should you consider it for your IT organization?\\nWell, the name is a false promise\u2013there are actually servers involved with serverless computing. They just aren\u2019t managed by the organization. A serverless computing model means your cloud provider takes care of adding, removing, and\/or adjusting your server resources based upon demand. You end up with a more accurate bill for your usage because it\u2019s based literally on milliseconds, not hours. There are a couple of ideas behind this: One is to avoid prepaying for resources that might be unused, resulting in huge savings for your organization. The second is taking the burden of server management off of the developer\u2019s hands, leaving them free to simply write code.\\nThis sounds like something out of the future, but the truth is, the future is now. The big cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft and Google) all offer serverless computing services, but Amazon\u2019s Lambda is perhaps the most well-known. According to their website, \u201cLambda runs your code on high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply the code.\u201d This saves the developer time and effort in rewriting code to fit a specific infrastructure requirement, meaning applications can deploy faster and more accurately.\\nServerless building blocks\\nThe code that\u2019s uploaded to AWS or Azure is known as a function. A function is an individual action or piece of logic. This tiny code unit is particularly useful for running jobs like these:\\n- Scheduled, repeatable tasks\\n- Web request processing\\n- Processing queue messages\\nThe entire function from beginning to end usually takes only milliseconds. It is these functions that form the building blocks of serverless architectures.\\nWhere do containers fit in?\\nContainers are the latest \u201chot thing,\u201d but is it possible that serverless computing will render containers obselete? As Michael Churchman of Rancher explains, probably not. \u201cServerless computing of the type represented by AWS Lambda can be an extremely valuable resource, \u2026 but it is far from being an all-around substitute for deploying and managing your own containers. Serverless computing is really designed to work with containers, rather than replacing them.\u201d\\nWhat are some cases where containers might be a better fit? If your application is larger and more complex than AWS or Azure can handle, a container-based system can be as large and complex as you need. If you\u2019re also looking for full control over the containers and the system on which they run, container-based deployment can do that. However, because serverless computing is run by a third party, you have no say in how it is run. For security and policy processes, serverless computing may not be a good fit. If you do decide to try your hand at serverless computing, a best practice is to start with new applications, rather than rewriting old ones to fit the model.\\nServerless computing is a new developer-friendly offering that holds a lot of potential for cost savings and software deployment efficiency. It is not, however, a replacement for all infrastructure architectures, including containers or on-premise deployment. Again, as with all things IT, whether you use serverless computing or not depends on what your application and organizational needs are. If you want to work in a serverless environment, you will need to prepare for some changes.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"multi-aspect","error":null,"n":2}

What are the key challenges in building a photography community both online and offline, and what tools can help streamline this process?","gold":"Building a photography community involves both in-person and digital components. For in-person networking, InstaMeets offer an excellent opportunity to connect with other photographers. These are planned local gatherings where photographers can share techniques, make new friends, and take photos together. You can find InstaMeets through Instagram's Community webpage or by searching hashtags like #wwim11. For managing the online aspect, social media management tools can help streamline your presence across platforms. Tools like Agorapulse allow you to post content, engage with your community, and download reports from a single dashboard.

In this article you\u2019ll discover the benefits of meeting up with like-minded photographers and how to find your nearest InstaMeet.\\nWhat Exactly Is An InstaMeet?\\nAn InstaMeet is a planned, local gathering of Instagram users who meet up for a few hours of photography. It\u2019s an opportunity to talk about mobile photography, learn techniques from each other, and best of all, make new friends.\\nJoining a local InstaMeet is a great way to connect with people that you may already follow on Instagram, but have never met in person. In addition, it\u2019s also an excellent means of connecting with other photographers in your area that you may not yet know or follow.\\nSince Instagram began several years ago, people have been meeting up locally to take photos together. As the community has grown around the world, so has the occurrence of formal InstaMeets.\\nHow To Participate\\nIf you\u2019re not aware of any InstaMeets in your area, the best place to start is with Instagram itself. The Instagram Community webpage has an interactive map that you can use to locate any currently known organized meet-ups in your area.\\nYou may also become aware of specific InstaMeets through friends on Instagram using hashtags such as #wwim11_ME, which was an InstaMeet scheduled for the 11th Worldwide Instameet in Portland, ME.\\nDoing a hashtag search on Instagram for something like \u201c#wwim11\u201d will bring up a long list of hashtags by city, country, etc. that you can explore. Since many of the InstaMeets are locally-organized, the naming convention for the hashtags is not always consistent, but with a little patience you\u2019re sure to find a group meeting in your area.\\nSome organizers may appreciate it if you let them know that you\u2019re planning to attend. However, the general rule of thumb is that all you need to do is show up at the planned time and location to join. It\u2019s as easy as that!\\nOnce you\u2019ve located a local InstaMeet that you want to join, make sure you follow the organizer to keep up with the latest news regarding the time and location.\\nAlso, be sure to invite your local friends! InstaMeets are all about bringing people together, so the more the merrier!\\nWhat To Bring\\nAs InstaMeets are an offshoot of Instagram, most participants show up with nothing more than their mobile phones and an adventurous attitude.\\nHowever, if you\u2019ve been on Instagram for some time, you\u2019ll notice that some users favor DSLRs and\/or mirrorless cameras over mobile devices. As such, some of the folks you\u2019re likely to meet will be shooting with larger cameras.\\nThis isn\u2019t a problem though. The whole point is to meet other photographers, share stories and learn from one another. The specific cameras that everyone uses are of secondary importance.\\nAssuming that you\u2019re planning to shoot only with your iPhone (as I do), you don\u2019t necessarily need to worry about bringing a bag full of gear. However, if you have an external charger\/battery pack for your iPhone, I would strongly encourage you to bring that with you. Even just a couple of hours of shooting can quickly drain your iPhone\u2019s battery.\\nWhat I typically do is bring a small backpack with a tripod, external battery and charging cords (for my external charger and for a wall outlet in case I get the chance to \u201cplug in\u201d). This also allows me to easily carry a snack and an extra layer of clothing in case of variable temperatures.\\nIn order to stay \u201cmobile\u201d and not have to pause for a lengthy charge session, I recently purchased a 6 foot cord for my iPhone from Apple so that I can connect my phone to my charger (an Anker E5) while the latter stays in my backpack. I can shoot for hours like this and never miss a shot due to a low battery.\\nNo InstaMeet in Your Area? Start Your Own!\\nIf you can\u2019t find an event in your local area, why not organize your own InstaMeet? It\u2019s never too late. Even if only a few people show up, that can make for a great day of photography and friendship! Check out the Instagram Blog for inspiration and helpful tips.\\nThe three key points for organizing your own InstaMeet, as mentioned on the Instagram blog are as follows:\\n1. Choose A Photogenic Location\\nPlanning to meet up in an area rich with photographic possibilities will make for a far more enjoyable day of shooting. While people\u2019s tastes and preferences can vary, certain locations such as cities\/urban areas tend to offer many opportunities for great photos.\\n2. Be Inclusive\\nBe sure to plan your event so that it\u2019s easily accessible for a wide range of people. Pick a location that\u2019s accessible to all (not a private or otherwise non-public location), offers plenty of free or reasonably inexpensive parking, and is sure to offer many opportunities for photography, discussion and other bonding experiences.\\n3. Spread The Word\\nIf you choose to start your own InstaMeet, be sure to spread the word as much as possible. Post to your Instagram feed about the InstaMeet and create a unique hashtag (see above for an example) so that folks can easily follow your plans.\\nAdditionally, having a unique hashtag allows participants to tag their own photos from the InstaMeet with that hashtag so that others can share in the great photos that were created that day.\\nDon\u2019t forget to share your plans via other channels such as Facebook, Twitter and any other social media outlets that you may use as well.\\nLast, and certainly not least, have fun! An InstaMeet shouldn\u2019t be stressful. Even if you\u2019re anxious about meeting a large number of new people, remember that you already have a fair amount in common with everyone that shows up.\\nYou all have a passion for photography, and you all enjoy sharing your work with others online. That\u2019s a great foundation upon which new friendships can be built.

The developers use BPEL to determine how business processes having web services will run.\\nApart from managing the process execution, BPEL is also used for event management and exception handling. The BPEL processes describe the order in which the processes will be called.\\nWhat is ESB in SOA?\\nThe software application within a service-oriented architecture communicates through a channel called ESB (Enterprise Service Bus). It is used to implement a different variant of the client-server architecture where any application using this system can be the client or the server.\\nESB is based on a distributed computing architecture and allows high-level communications between different applications.\\nWhat is orchestration in SOA?\\nOrchestration in SOA is the management and coordination of different services within SOA. The system experts use the service orchestration feature to automate the business processes by grouping the enterprises and applications to combine them into a single unit.\\nThe process is made possible through the exchanging of messages in the domain layer of applications. These messages have to be exchanged according to a predefined order or business logic.\\nWhat is OSB in SOA?\\nThe OSB (Oracle Service Bus) is used for virtualizing, managing, and integrating the services in a shared architecture. It helps to manage the interactions between the applications and services.\\nThey can be implemented through a lightweight service call. The services developed using the OSB can work as a proxy.\\nHow to build a composite in SOA?\\nThe steps to build a composite application in SOA are:\\n- Open Oracle JDeveloper Studio\\n- Make a new Composite application.\\n- If this is the first application, choose SOA application from the Application Template. After accepting the package prefix defaults, click Next.\\n- After JDeveloper adds the necessary libraries and the composite.xml file to the project, click on Next.\\n- Hit Next.\\n- Click on Empty Composite on the SOA Configure Settings page to create an empty composite application.\\n- Select Save All from the File menu.\\nWhat is BAM in SOA?\\nThe Oracle BAM (Business Activity Monitoring) is used for developing personalized dashboards and monitors the business processes in a firm.

An acoustic guitar is capable of many genres with its unique voice. Though simple in design, the sight of worrys and strings might overwhelm beginners. Follow along if you\u2019re looking to get started playing the acoustic guitar!\\nUnlike electric guitars, the acoustic guitar generates its sound using only the vibration of strings as they resonate with the instrument\u2019s body. Especially with acoustics, the type of wooden used to make the guitar, the strings, and the guitar\u2019s shape all play a vital role in how the guitar sounds.\\nYou are watching: How to Play Acoustic Guitar \u2013 Complete Beginner\u2019s Guide\\nThere are typically two types of acoustic guitars. For the beginner, selecting which of the two is best for you depends on the genre of music you want to play.\\nFor those who want to learn classical guitar, flamenco, or more traditional music, the nylon string guitar or classical guitar is the best option.\\nFor those who want to play rock, blues, or country songs on guitar, a steel-string acoustic guitar is a great option.\\nThese genre suggestions are not hard and fast rules, as each acoustic has a unique voice in various genres. These guidelines are here to help you narrow your choices when you select your guitar.\\nConsider: Is it difficult to learn guitar?\\nParts of the Guitar\\nWhether classical or steel-string acoustic, the parts that make the guitar are the same.\\nYou will want to know the guitar parts\u2019 names if you take guitar lessons, as your guitar teacher will likely refer to parts of the guitar during their instruction. Knowing the terms is a vital part of learning how to play the acoustic guitar.\\nIt\u2019s also essential to know some of the specific parts\u2019 names so who if you ever need to replace, repair, or upgrade a particular part, you can communicate or search for that specific piece.\\nThe body of the guitar is the largest part of the guitar that has a round shape. Guitars have different shapes that affect the sound. When you purchase your guitar, make sure who you sit down with it and try to hold it as if you were going to play it. Take note of which body shapes or sizes feel comfortable to you.\\nThe sound hole is the round opening in the body. It is where the sound waves the guitar generates release into the air so you can hear it. When you begin to play the guitar with your guitar pick or with your fingers, you will typically play over the soundhole.\\nThe bridge is whereby the strings attach to the body. This piece is responsible for anchoring the strings so they can be tightened and loosened when you tune your guitar.\\nNeck and Fretboard\\nThe neck is the long and skinny piece of the guitar attached to the guitar\u2019s body. On the neck are thin pieces of metal that separate the neck into different areas.\\nThese metal pieces are called frets and are references to place your fingers for playing different notes and chords. The stresss and dots on the guitar\u2019s neck make what\u2019s called the guitar\u2019s worryboard.\\nHeadstock and Machine Heads\\nMoving down the neck towards the pieces on the opposite side of the body, you will find the nut, headstock, machine heads, or tuners.\\nThe headstock is the part of the guitar at the furthest end away from the body. The headstock anchors the strings on their side opposite the bridge and wherein the machine heads attach to the guitar.\\nMachine Heads or Tuners\\nMachine heads are responsible for tuning the guitar. Also called tuners, the guitar strings will create higher or lower notes as you turn these pieces in different directions.\\nNotes and Chords\\nThe guitar is a versatile instrument, capable of making both notes and chords. There are letter names to help musicians communicate and identify what they want to play. Learning these names is a important part of learning how to play the acoustic guitar.\\nOpen String Names\\nSit with your guitar in your lap with the neck extending to your left. When you look down at your strings, you\u2019ll see that they go from thicker strings at the top closest to you to thinner strings down at the bottom near your leg.\\nFrom bottom to top, or from thinnest to thickest, the guitar\u2019s string names are E B G D A E.\\nWhen you learn the guitar, usually teachers and lessons refer to the high E-string, or the thinnest string at the bottom, as \u201chigh E\u201d to differentiate it from the other E-string at the top. This high E-string is also called the first string. After who, the string is your B-string, called the second string, and so on until you reach the low E-string as the sixth string.\\nWhen you pluck any of the strings on your guitar by itself, you write a note. For example, when you play your high E-string on its own, you produce a note called E. Notes are singular entities in music that you hear on their own.\\nA chord is a group of notes played simultaneously. If you play your E, B, and G strings together, you have played a chord. Just like notes, chords have names so musicians can communicate and read them.\\nTogether, guitarists use both notes and chords to play songs. Normally, beginners learn basic chords first before notes. Mastering the basics allows you to learn and write your songs later on.\\nHow to Play the Acoustic Guitar\\nNow that you know how the acoustic guitar works, you can begin learning how to play your guitar. The skills you will need to play the guitar will take time for your body to get used to, as these are new intricate skills. In the beginning, you are likely to feel awkward but keep in mind that practice will help your body become more comfortable.\\nMost acoustic guitar players play while seated, but it is as well possible to play while standing if you have a guitar strap attached.\\nIf you are seated, your guitar mustn\u2019t be angled away from you so that if you look down, all six strings are visible. Hold the guitar close to you so the bottom edge of the rests wholely on your leg. When you look straight down, you should only see the Low E-string.\\nWhile either seated or standing, keep your back straight through your shoulders relaxed. Position your arm around your guitar\u2019s body between the body\u2019s lower edge and right side so your hand can place itself on the strings in front of the soundhole.\\nYour left hand should anchor itself behind the neck with the other four fingers curved around the neck from the bottom so they can access the stressboard.\\nHow to Fret\\nThe worrys on your guitar indicate higher or lower notes on your guitar.\\nTo play specific notes, you will use your left hand\u2019s fingers to hold down a string to a particular worry. To stress a string, you should use the tips of your index, ring, middle, or ring finger to hold the note.\\nYour guitar teacher or lessons will indicate your index finger as your first finger, your middle finger as your second finger, and so on until your pinky, which they call your fourth finger.\\nDifferent string thicknesses will require different amounts of pressure from your fingers. When you play a string while holding one of its frets, you will hear a clear pitch ring out if you apply enough pressure with your left hand.\\nIf you hear a dead note or a buzzing sound, you ought to apply more pressure until the note rings clear.\\nUsing a Guitar Pick\\nMost beginners will learn their first chords and songs through a guitar pick.\\nHold a guitar pick correctly, grip the pick with your thumb and index finger in your left hand with both fingers\u2019 top part. The pointed end of your pick should stick out from the side of your fingers, creating a 90-degree angle.\\nTo pick the strings, use your wrist to compose the up and down movement while keeping pressure in both of your fingers so the strings ring out.\\nYou can practice holding and through the guitar pick by holding it in your hands and through your wrist to guide the up and down motion. Practice using the pick to strum all six of your guitar strings together. Then, practice via your pick to strike one or two strings at a time.\\nPlaying Your First Chord\\nNow who you know how to play acoustic guitar, you can begin to learn your first chord. A simple chord to start with is the E minor chord.\\nTo play E minor, place your second (middle) finger on your A-string\u2019s second fret and hold that note. Then, take your third (ring) finger and put it on your D-string\u2019s second worry while keeping your first finger in place about it.\\nStrum all six strings together to play an E-minor chord. You\u2019ll want to learn to read guitar chord charts properly as this will be an important skill as you start to learn guitar.\\nFrom there, you\u2019ll be able to start learning more chords and commencement learning to play your acoustic!\\nFind some more plain chords to play:\\nG severe (G Chord) on guitar\\nC serious (C chord) on guitar\\nD significant (D chord) on guitar\\nTeach yourself to play guitar soon\\nLast Updated on April 5, 2021 by Liam F.

{"id":434,"question":"why do toll receptors control both immunity and brain changes","gold":"Toll receptors play dual roles in both the immune system and brain plasticity possibly because the nervous system and immune system may have shared a common evolutionary origin. This is supported by their similar protective functions - the immune system protects against microbes while the nervous system protects against larger dangers through behavior. Research has shown that these Toll receptors, which are well-known for regulating the immune system, are also involved in nervous system formation and brain plasticity.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:8f575814-fbf6-4071-b3aa-988200f2c066>']","texts":"['Uncovering the plastic brain of a fruit fly \u2013 new study\\nGenetic mechanisms that govern brain plasticity \u2013 the brain\u2019s ability to change and adapt \u2013 have been uncovered by researchers at the University of Birmingham.\\nThe work was carried out using the fruit fly Drosophila, an important organism in neuroscience because it enables researchers to study an entire nervous system. That means genes can be identified and linked all the way from to specific neurons, to neural circuits, brain structure and behaviour.\\nThis fundamental research could pave the way to a deeper understanding of how the human brain adapts over time, and the links between plasticity and neurodegeneration.\\nScientists have known for some time that human brains are adaptable and plastic. For example, our brains change as we learn new things, or enable us to adapt and compensate after an amputation or if part of our brain becomes damaged. The mechanisms behind this plasticity, however, are not well understood.\\nIn a new study, published in the journal eLife on 18 February 2020, researchers in the University of Birmingham\u2019s School of Biosciences have identified a particular set of genes that regulate brain plasticity.\\nThe genes encode proteins called Toll receptors \u2013 responsible for receiving and transmitting signals within cells. Tolls are known to play a central role in the body\u2019s immune system, but the Birmingham team, led by Professor Alicia Hidalgo, had shown that they also influence nervous system formation. Now, linking Tolls to brain plasticity is a further significant and surprising development.\\nProfessor Hidalgo explains: \u201cThe specific molecules we identified are well known for the role they play in regulating the body\u2019s immune system. Perhaps in evolution the nervous system and the immune system shared a common origin, as they share similar functions \u2013 for example, the immune system helps to protect us from microbes, while our nervous system through behaviour plays a role in protecting us from larger dangers, like reacting to threats. And it seems that brain plasticity re-activates the mechanisms that operate during the formation of the brain in development.\u201d\\nThe researchers found that the Toll receptors, of which there are 9 in the Drosophila brain and 11 in the human brain, are present across different areas of the brain dedicated to different functions. From here they regulate neuronal number and brain size.\\n\u201cThis arrangement of the Tolls suggests they can work independently of each other, perhaps to control the response to different sensory stimuli such as smell, or vision,\u201d says Professor Hidalgo. \u201cThese can then be modulated to influence the formation and maintenance of particular types of neurons in response to experience.\u201d\\nIt is not yet known how closely these mechanisms, identified in Drosophila will match those in the human brain, but the work gives us important clues into what to look for in the human brain to understand brain plasticity.\\n\u201cDrosophila is a powerful model organism because we can show that brain plasticity has a genetic basis and identify how genes control this process,\u201d says Professor Hidalgo. \u201cThis gives us a really useful set of clues and insights into the molecular mechanisms of plasticity also in human brains.\u201d\\nNotes to editor:\\n- For media enquiries please contact Beck Lockwood, Press Office, University of Birmingham, tel: +44 (0)121 414 2772.\\n- The University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world\u2019s top 100 institutions.

They are well placed to answer the most commonly asked questions about 3D printing.\\nWhat is 3D printing?\\n3D printing is known in the industry as \u2018additive manufacturing\u2019. It is a process of joining materials layer-by-layer based on data from computer assisted design (CAD), and is an alternative to subtractive manufacturing methods such as milling, drilling, turning, eroding, or formative manufacturing methods like injection moulding.\\nWhat is 3D printing used for?\\n3D printing is a flexible technology which allows you to manufacture one-off individual components as well as batches of multiple parts. There are many uses for the technology across the world.\\nIn the medical sector it is used for creating patient-specific implants and customised hearing aids, while a sportswear brand is creating optimised trainer sole geometry to give runners the best support and comfort. These would not be possible using traditional manufacturing methods.\\nHistorically, the automotive industry has used the technology for prototyping, but motorsport and aerospace work with 3D printed parts to help improve performance and efficiency.\\nAt Jaguar Land Rover 3D printing technology has been used to develop prototype parts. Engineering teams can test a printed component and make the changes to the design, before officially using it in production.\\nThe technology is quickly evolving. Jaguar Land Rover is now able to 3D print parts for production cars, with the Jaguar XE SV Project 8 one of the first vehicles to use them. The team has also created a glove that will protect colleagues on the line from musculoskeletal disorders.\\nThe Additive Manufacturing team has also been creating small runs of obsolete parts for older cars, such as the third row seat handle for the Land Rover Discovery Series 2.\\nThe freedom of design is allowing Jaguar Land Rover to explore enhanced personalisation and customisation opportunities for its customers.\\nWhat things can be 3D printed?\\nAlmost anything, however the most suitable parts are small and complex. Making these through traditional manufacturing practices may not be possible and\/or too expensive.\\nThere are many materials available, including polymers, metals, and others such as ceramics. In engineering, 3D printing is increasingly being used for creating silicone mould tools and sand casts from which parts can be economically formed, including large metal components.\\nWhat are the main 3D printing technologies?\\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has acknowledged seven core 3D printing technologies. Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Additive Manufacturing team has explained them in simple terms.\\nPowder bed fusion \u2013 is the process of using heat to fuse powdered material, either polymer or metal, to form an object. It is relatively affordable and uses engineering grade materials. This technique was used to develop the 3D printed parts on the XE SV Project 8 and the Discovery Series 2\u2019s squab handle.\\nMaterial jetting \u2013 uses inkjet print heads to eject droplets of material. It is often used by designers to mock-up ideas thanks to its ability to print in full colour.\\nMaterial extrusion \u2013 is the process of depositing material through a heated nozzle, which is often used to build large, functional prototype parts, and manufacturing aids.\\nVat photopolymerisation \u2013 this technology was the first available in the 1980s. A bath of liquid material is cured with either a UV laser or a projected image. Primarily it is used for design mock-ups and non-functional prototypes, however new advances means the technology could be used to build production parts.\\nBinder jetting \u2013 depositing a binding agent onto a powdered material through a print head which is then typically cured with UV or heat.\\nDirect energy deposition \u2013 depositing a stream of material and melting it via a high energy source such as a laser. The material is often metal in wire or powder form. Normally it is used to repair parts rather than creating entire objects.\\nSheet lamination \u2013 the bonding of pre-cut layers of sheet material. This can include wood, paper or metal.\\nWhich 3D printing technologies does Jaguar Land Rover use?\\nVat photopolymerisation was the first 3D printing technology acquired by Jaguar Land Rover over 25 years ago. It is often used by the team for building prototype parts which require a high quality surface finish.\\nPowder bed fusion followed soon after, and today has the highest output of any Additive Manufacturing technology used at Jaguar Land Rover. It allows the team to build relatively low-cost functional parts.\\nAround 20 years ago material jetting was adopted. This process allows the team to print in full colour with the ability to colour match, which is useful for printing head and tail light lenses, or dashboard trim.\\nAt the same time, material extrusion was chosen for its capability to print good functional prototypes. The latest machines are capable of printing large geometry components from a wide range of materials, including temperature resistant polymers and composites.\\nWhat material does Jaguar Land Rover 3D print in?\\nEach additive manufacturing technology at Jaguar Land Rover uses a different type of material. Although expanding rapidly, the current portfolio of materials includes nylons, polyurethanes, epoxies, and composites, among others.\\nHow long does it take to 3D print?\\nThe 3D printing process alone can take from a few hours right up to 200 hours depending on the size of the machine and the number of parts printed in each batch.\\nAfter the parts are printed, they have to go through a variety of post-processing procedures, which can range from cooling, removal of support material or cleaning of the parts.\\nWhat are the biggest obstacles to 3D printing?\\nPiece cost \u2013 Primarily due to high material costs, often caused by a closed supply route.\\nDimensional accuracy \u2013 3D printing currently has more variation in it parts compared to a traditional tooled process. This means it is not always ideal when producing automotive components as they often have stringent tolerances they need to meet.\\nAwareness \u2013 3D printing had various limitations in the past, such as poor mechanical properties. Many of these have been overcome and now companies can realise the potential benefits if parts are designed for additive manufacturing production from the outset.\\nSurface finish \u2013 To reach the same finish as traditionally tooled components, 3D printed parts need post process activity. Improvements to the 3D printing process have been made and surface textures can now be easily applied.', \"Updated \u00b7 Dec 03, 2022\\nWhat Are the Different Types of 3D Printers?\\nUpdated \u00b7 Oct 16, 2022\\nWhen most people hear about 3D printing, they picture something large, expensive, and challenging to use.\\nHowever, nowadays, there are many different types of 3D printers available on the market. So many that, in fact, shopping for one can be quite overwhelming.\\nBelow, we'll go over everything you need to know about 3D printers and how to utilize them effectively.\\nWhat Is a 3D Printer?\\n3D printing is a type of additive manufacturing technology that creates three-dimensional objects by laying down successive layers of material.\\n3D printers are generally faster, more affordable, and often easier to use than other manufacturing technologies.\\nAdditionally, they can create more complex shapes, well-suited for prototyping and custom manufacturing applications.\\nThe applications of 3D printing are virtually limitless\u2014it has found its way into various industries, from aerospace to medicine.\\nFurthermore, the technology is becoming more and more accessible and affordable, making it a viable option for hobbyists and businesses of all sizes.\\nHow Do 3D Printers Work?\\nThe successful production of 3D models requires you to follow these steps:\\nDesign a Model\\nThe first thing you need to do is design the item you want to print.\\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind when designing:\\n- Ensure you have a solid foundation to prevent the object from toppling over or collapsing during the printing process.\\n- Pay attention to the wall thickness. Often, models are unprintable because their walls are too thin, causing them to be extremely fragile and break. Alternatively, they may be too thick, which builds up the internal pressure, resulting in cracks.\\n- Consider the types of 3D printing materials. Different materials have different benefits, so choosing the one that will work well for the desired final product is essential.\\nKeeping those factors in mind, almost anything can be designed and printed in 3D.\\nNow, it's time to print the object.\\nYou'll need to upload your model to your chosen printing software and ensure everything is appropriately adjusted.\\nThe printing process depends on your printer type. We'll go over the available technologies in detail below.\\nFurthermore, the printer also determines the type of materials you can use. Some standard options include plastics, metals, ceramics, and composites.\\nOnce the object is printed, you'll need to add some finishing touches. That typically involves removing support structures and smoothing the surface of the object.\\nYou may also paint your creation, which is a whole other challenge and skill.\\nTypes of 3D Printing Technology\\n3D printers use several different methods to produce the objects of your design.\\nAll of them have different benefits and applications, so let's see which one would serve you best.\\nOne of the most popular 3D printing techniques is material extrusion.\\nIt works by depositing molten plastic filament through a small nozzle. The nozzle moves across a platform, following a predetermined path to create the desired shape.\\nIt's often used for prototyping and small-scale models, as it's the most affordable 3D printing method, and the material waste is minimal.\\nAnother benefit is that it works with a wide range of materials, including plastics, metals, bio gels, and even chocolate.\\nVat polymerization is a process in which a liquid photopolymer is cured inside a vat by exposure to a light source.\\nThe 3D laser printers that use this technology differ depending on the light source, which affects the production time, costs, and degree of accuracy.\\nVat polymerization is typically suitable for projects that require a lot of precision, such as jewelry or dental models. It can also make prototypes and parts with complex geometries.\\nPowder Bed Fusion\\nPowder bed fusion uses a laser to melt and fuse together powdered materials and create a solid object. It works with thermoplastic, metal, and ceramic powders.\\nThis printing technology can produce complex shapes and functional parts with excellent mechanical properties.\\nThat makes it ideal for prototype development and small-scale production runs.\\nMaterial jetting is a process of selectively depositing droplets of molten types of 3D printer filament onto a platform layer by layer to create a three-dimensional object.\\nThese systems generally use a print head that moves back and forth across a platform while setting down successive layers of material. The material is deposited through a nozzle with a diameter of fewer than 200 microns.\\nAdditionally, the print heads can be configured to lay down different materials simultaneously, allowing for designs with complex colors or multiple material properties.\\nHowever, a drawback of material jetting is that it's generally slower and more expensive than other methods.\\nBinder jetting is a type of 3D printing that uses a liquid binding agent to combine powder particles. It can create prototypes and functional production parts for various industries.\\nIt uses an inkjet-style printhead to deposit the binding agent onto the powder bed and selectively combine the 3D printer powder particles in the desired shape.\\nOnce the part is printed, it needs to be sintered or cured to further improve its mechanical properties.\\nBinder jetting can print large parts with complex geometries from various materials, such as metals, polymers, and sand.\\nDirect Energy Deposition (DED)\\nDED systems use a focused beam of energy (usually a laser or an electron beam) to melt metals in powder or wire form as they're deposited onto a platform.\\nThe molten material then cools and solidifies, bonding to the layer below. These additive manufacturing types of printers are well suited for creating large, complex objects with delicate features and detail.\\nAdditionally, DED can build objects from multiple materials, giving designers greater freedom to create complex functional parts.\\nMicro 3D Printing\\nMicro 3D printing uses microscopic nozzles to deposit material in extremely fine layers.\\nThis process allows for the creation of parts and structures with intricate detail and high resolution.\\nIn addition, micro 3D printing works with a wide variety of materials, including metals, plastics, and ceramics.\\nAs a result, this example of the latest 3D printing technologies is becoming increasingly popular in medical implants and electronic components production.\\nThis technique uses sheets of material, usually paper, plastic, and metal, to build up objects. They are laminated together using adhesive, heat, or ultrasonic energy.\\nThe process is commonly utilized to produce non-functional prototypes and multicolor prints.\\nIts main advantages are the low costs and the quick printing times.\\nWhat Are the Different Types of 3D Printers?\\nNow that you know the principles 3D printers operate on, let's take a look at some of the most popular and widely available models on the market.\\nDigital Light Processing (DLP)\\nDLP printers use the vat polymerization technique. Namely, an array of light sources cure a photopolymer resin, layer by layer, into a solid object.\\nThe process is similar to SLA 3D printers, another popular choice among enthusiasts, but this one uses a digital projector instead of a laser to cure the resin.\\nThis technology is well-suited for printing high-detail objects, such as medical models and prototypes.\\nDLP printers typically have a smaller build volume than the SLA ones but are generally faster and more affordable.\\nSLA printers also utilize the vat polymerization method. With the help of strategically positioned mirrors, a laser beam is directed to cure and solidify liquid resin into an object.\\nThe process starts by selectively scanning the cross-section of the model image onto the surface of a vat filled with photopolymer resin.\\nFor each layer, the laser beam traces a cross-section of the part pattern on the platform submerged in the liquid resin.\\nDuring scanning, the laser moves in both horizontal and vertical directions and crosses over itself many times to achieve the desired effect.\\nThe areas where the beam hits solidify almost instantly while the rest remain liquid. The process continues until all layers have been built up.\\nFused Deposition Modeling (FDM)\\nFDM 3D printer types use material extrusion technology to create the desired objects.\\nIt's one of the most popular methods of 3D printing due to its relative simplicity and affordability. It's also fast and can produce objects with good levels of accuracy.\\nHowever, FDM has some limitations and might require you to add support structures. Nonetheless, it remains a popular choice for hobbyists and professionals alike.\\nThese printers are relatively easy to use and maintain. Another key benefit is that they work with a wide range of materials, including PLA, ABS, PETG, nylon, bio gels, etc.\\nSelective Laser Sintering (SLS)\\nSLS is among the 3D printer types that use powder bed fusion technology.\\nThis additive manufacturing process starts by heating a bin of polymer powder to right before the point of melting. Then, a very thin layer of it is deposited on a platform to be scanned.\\nAfterward, a laser solidifies a select cross-section of the material, and a new layer is added. The process repeats until the object is complete.\\nSLS printers can create prototype parts or objects with complex geometries that would be difficult and time-consuming to make with traditional manufacturing methods.\\nSelective Laser Melting (SLM) & Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)\\nDMLS and SLM printers also utilize powder bed fusion technology.\\nBoth use a laser to melt and fuse together metal powder particles to build three-dimensional parts layer by layer. However, the way they do it differs.\\nWith SLM, the powder is deposited and then completely melted by the laser. In comparison, with DMLS, the powder isn't melted; rather, it's heated so that it can fuse on a molecular level.\\nBoth processes can produce parts with intricate shapes and fine details but from different materials. SLM uses single-element materials like titanium, while DMLS works with metal alloys.\\nElectron Beam Melting (EBM)\\nAs you can see, powder bed fusion technology is one of the most commonly chosen methods of 3D printing among enthusiasts and professionals.\\nEBM is another example. It uses an electron beam to melt and fuse metal powder particles.\\nIt's similar to SLM, but instead of a laser, it uses an electron beam as its energy source.\\nThis technology is suitable for producing objects with a larger size, layer thickness, and surface finish.\\nMulti Jet Fusion (MJF)\\nAnd for the last of the powder bed fusion technology, we have MJF printers. They work with powdered materials and jetted inks to create the designed object.\\nThe process begins by spreading a layer of powder material over a platform. Then, an inkjet print head selectively sprays fusing and detailing agents onto the powder.\\nThat is followed by an infrared unit that heats the layer of material. Everywhere the fusing agent has been applied fuses with the underlying layer. Meanwhile, the detailing agent prevents the rest from melting.\\nThis 3D printing process repeats until the achievement of the desired result. MJF-printed objects have increased strength or stiffness and minimal material waste.\\nMaterial Jetting (MJ)\\nMaterial Jetting uses an inkjet printhead to selectively jet droplets of material onto a platform.\\nIt's a relatively slow process as each layer needs to be cured with UV light before depositing the next one.\\nIt works with many photopolymer resins and provides the best surface finish.\\nMetal Binder Jetting\\nThis 3D printing technology produces objects from metal powder with a polymer binding agent.\\nOnce the printing process is complete, the platform is removed, and the object is sintered in an oven. That removes the binding agent as well and fuses the powder particles together to form a solid metal object with good mechanical properties.\\nMetal binder jetting is well suited for large build volumes and prototyping applications.\\nIn addition, it offers a wide range of design freedom, as it can create parts with complex geometries.\\nElectron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM)\\nEBAM uses the direct energy deposition method to build 3D printer products.\\nIn this process, an electron beam melts and depositions material onto a substrate. Additionally, a vacuum chamber helps keep the environment around the platform clean and free of contaminants.\\nHowever, this technology is quite expensive compared to other more mainstream options. On the plus side, it doesn't require any support structures for the objects and allows a mixture of metals.\\nEBAM also works well for repairing different high-end components and creating functional prototypes.\\nMicrostereolithography, or \u00b5SLA, uses a focused UV laser to cure photopolymer resin into tiny solid objects.\\n\u00b5SLA printers are well-suited for creating high-accuracy parts with complex geometries and delicate features.\\nIn addition, these prints are dimensionally stable and have low warping compared to similar technologies.\\nThese 3D printing techniques find application in medicine and electronics production.\\nLaminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) (Sheet Lamination)\\nLOM is a 3D printing process that uses sheets of material bonded together and cut to shape using a laser or blade.\\nThat is an affordable and fast technique, but it's low in accuracy and requires much post-production work.\\nLOM is typically used for non-functional prototypes and multicolor prints. It works well with paper, polymer, and metal materials.\\nHow To Choose From All Types of 3D Printers?\\n3D printers have come a long way in recent years, and now consumers have a wide variety of options to choose from.\\nSo how do you select the right 3D printer for your needs?\\nHere is what you should focus on:\\n- Consider the type of material you want to print with. 3D printers can generally handle PLA and ABS plastic, but some also support materials like wood, metal, or glass.\\n- Think about the size and resolution of the prints you want to create. Some 3D printers can print huge objects, while others are better suited for smaller, more detailed items.\\n- Resolution is another critical factor\u2014if you need very precise prints, go for the type of 3D printing technology that ensures high-resolution capabilities.\\n- Determine a budget. 3D printers can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, so selecting a model that falls within your price range is essential.\\nOnce you clear your needs and priorities, you'll be able to choose the best 3D printer for your projects.\\nThere are many kinds of 3D printers available on the market today. Each technology has its strengths, making it perfect for a particular application. Though, they also come with certain limitations.\\nWhen choosing a 3D printer, it's important to consider the specific requirements of your future projects.\\nThat includes the materials you want to use, the complexity of your designs, and the cost of production you can afford.\\nWhat does a 3D printer use?\\n3D printers use additive manufacturing processes to create three-dimensional objects from a digital file. The printer deposits successive layers of material, typically plastic or metal, until the item is complete.\\nUnlike traditional manufacturing processes, which require extensive tooling and setup time, a 3D printer can produce complex objects quickly and cheaply.\\nAs a result, the technology is often used for the creation of prototype models and one-of-a-kind parts.\\nToday, 3D printers are widely available in various settings, from schools and small businesses to large factories.\\nWhat type of manufacturing is 3D printing?\\n3D printing is a type of additive manufacturing that builds objects by adding materials layer by layer.\\nUnlike traditional machining processes (like milling or lathing), additive manufacturing doesn't require extensive material removal, which makes it much more efficient.\\n3D printing can be used to create objects of almost any shape or size, from small medical implants to large aircraft parts.\\nThe technology is also well suited for mass customization since each object can be easily altered to meet the customer's specific needs.\\nWhat to print on a 3D printer?\\nWhen it comes to 3D printing ideas, the sky's the limit. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when choosing your next project.\\n- First, consider the material you'll be using. For example, PLA is a good choice for detailed prints, while ABS is more durable and better suited for functional items.\\n- Second, think about the size and scale of your print. Smaller prints are generally more challenging, but choosing a design that will fit your printer bed is essential.\\n- Finally, determine the complexity of the design. If you're new to 3D printing, starting with a simple model is best.\\nOnce you have a few successful prints under your belt, you can start experimenting with more complex designs and different materials.\\nWhat are 3D printed objects made of?\\n3D printed objects are made of a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, and even human cells.\\n3D printing allows for the production of highly detailed and complex shapes that are challenging to create with traditional manufacturing methods.\\nCommonly, the materials used in additive manufacturing are in the form of a fine powder, but that depends on the types of 3D printers used.\\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the creation of functional objects made of metal, ceramics, and even human tissue.\\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, it's already revolutionizing how we manufacture products!\\nDeyan has been fascinated by technology his whole life. From the first Tetris game all the way to Falcon Heavy. Working for TechJury is like a dream come true, combining both his passions \u2013 writing and technology. In his free time (which is pretty scarce, thanks to his three kids), Deyan enjoys traveling and exploring new places. Always with a few chargers and a couple of gadgets in the backpack.

Diogenes of Oenoanda was a wealthy Epicurean from the Second Century of Common Era who lived in what is today the south of Turkey. He erected the wall with an inscription of Epicurean teachings so that the teachings would benefit all passers-by. The two major portions of the inscription are an epitome on the physics and another one on the ethics. The key portion on pleasure are fragments 32-35. It begins by tackling how virtues are the means and pleasure is the end:\\nIf, gentlemen, the point at issue between these people and us involved inquiry into \u00abwhat is the means of happiness?\u00bb and they wanted to say \u00abthe virtues\u00bb (which would actually be true), it would be unnecessary to take any other step than to agree with them about this, without more ado. But since, as I say, the issue is not \u00abwhat is the means of happiness?\u00bb but \u00abwhat is happiness and what is the ultimate goal of our nature?\u00bb, I say both now and always, shouting out loudly to all Greeks and non-Greeks, that pleasure is the end of the best mode of life, while the virtues, which are inopportunely messed about by these people (being transferred from the place of the means to that of the end), are in no way an end, but the means to the end \u2026\\nHe then goes on to argue that the virtues benefit man, and exist and act for the sake of his nature. Diogenes says that there are three categories of causes of pleasure according to time: those that precede the pleasure, those that coincide with it (coincident causes, among which the virtues are to be found according to Diogenes), and those that follow the pleasure. Fragment 33:\\nWell now, I want to deflect also the error that \u2026 further inflates your doctrine as ignorant. The error is this: [not] all causes in things precede their effects, even if the majority do, but some of them precede their effects, others [coincide with] them, and others follow them.\\nExamples of causes that precede are cautery and surgery saving life: in these cases extreme pain must be borne, and it is after this that pleasure quickly follows.\\nExamples of coincident causes are [solid] and liquid nourishment and, in addition to these, [sexual acts:] we do not eat [food] and experience pleasure afterwards, nor do we drink wine and experience pleasure afterwards, nor do we emit semen and experience pleasure afterwards; rather the action brings about these pleasures for us immediately, without awaiting the future.\\n[As for causes that follow, an example is expecting] to win praise after death: although men experience pleasure now because there will be a favourable memory of them after they have gone, nevertheless the cause of the pleasure occurs later.\\nNow you, being unable to mark off these distinctions, and being unaware that the virtues have a place among the causes that coincide with their effects (for they are borne along with [pleasure), go completely astray.]\\nThe ability to remember and anticipate past and future pleasures will be discussed in a future essay, and relates to this, but first I wish to explain that the above passage is controversial among Epicureans, who tend to stay away from talk of virtue precisely because of our preference for clear speech. Prudence is the kind of virtue by which we plan for the future, and while we may take pleasure in the anticipation of future confidence and stability, it\u2019s not immediately clear that it (like all \u201cthe virtues\u201d, according to Diogenes) is coincident with its effect (pleasure).\\nIn Fragment 34, Diogenes rephrases the portion on choices and avoidances from the Letter to Menoeceus, and then once again revisits the subject of pleasures\u2019 causes in time using garden imagery, explaining how the seeds of different pleasures germinate in different seasons.\\n\u2026 [let us] not [avoid every pain that is present, and let us not choose every pleasure, as the many always do. Each person must employ reasoning,] since he [will not always achieve immediate success: just as] exertion (?) [often] involves one [gain at the beginning and] certain [others as time passes by], so it is also with [experiencing pleasure;] for sowings of seeds do [not] bring [the same benefit] to the sower but we see some seeds very quickly germinating [and bearing fruit and others taking longer] \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 of pleasures and [pains] \u2026\u2026.. [pleasure].\\nIn my book, I translated katastematic pleasure as abiding pleasure, and kinetic as dynamic pleasure. Dan Gilbert in his science of happiness book and TED Talk, uses natural and synthetic happiness. The Oenoanda page speaks instead of pleasure in states and in actions (static and active), and gives some insight into how an Epicurean from the Second Century CE defined static pleasure and into how ataraxia (equanimity, imperturbability), while not identical to pleasure, opens the way for pleasure.\\nLet us now [investigate] how life is to be made pleasant for us both in states and in actions.\\nLet us first discuss states, keeping an eye on the point that, when the emotions which disturb the soul are removed, those which produce pleasure enter into it to take their place.\\nWell, what are the disturbing emotions? [They are] fears \u2014of the gods, of death, and of [pains]\u2014 and, besides [these], desires that [outrun] the limits fixed by nature. These are the roots of all evils, and, [unless] we cut them off, [a multitude] of evils will grow [upon] us.\\nThe premise here is that, as sentient beings, at least so long as we are awake and conscious, we are always in some state of being. As philosophers, we should therefore be mindful of the dispositions that inform our states of mind\u2014and some of these are hidden or unconscious\u2013so that the perturbances can be healed in order to allow for pleasure to enter and take their place. Notice that there are four roots of evil that are clearly identified for our introspection and inner work.\\nOf the unconscious nature of many of these fearful dispositions, we read in Fragment 35:\\nAs a matter of fact this fear is sometimes clear, sometimes not clear\u2014clear when we avoid something manifestly harmful like fire through fear that we shall meet death by it, not clear when, while the mind is occupied with something else, it (fear) has insinuated itself into our nature and [lurks] \u2026\\nThis accentuates the psychotherapeutic nature of Epicurean ethics: we frequently use avoidance, repression, projection, and other techniques to lie to ourselves about what perturbs us. We therefore have to confront ourselves with honesty in order to profit from the Epicurean process of philosophy. And so Epicurean therapy\u2013the purpose of which is to secure a life filled with pleasures\u2013requires introspection, focus, attention, and the healing and training of the mind so that it may be pleasantly occupied.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"quantitative","error":null,"n":1}

At Independence in 1864, troops were able to utilize natural cover like timber, fences and hedges, with forces taking defensive positions in these areas. In contrast, at Iwo Jima in 1945, the volcanic ash beach terrain was a major hindrance - soldiers couldn't get traction to run, making them vulnerable targets. The ash also made it difficult to dig proper foxholes as they would collapse. This lack of mobility and cover on Iwo Jima contributed to heavy casualties, as soldiers were easily targeted while bunched up on the beach with limited ability to move quickly to safety.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:393a0329-7dfa-4794-8b77-047fc90789db>', '<urn:uuid:2ee9c301-3df0-4205-95f0-1d72f14a1ac5>']","texts":"['Oct. 6, 1864 \u2014 Daviess Countians involved in the Battle of Westport\\nI have the honor to report that pursuant to your orders I marched with my command of five companies, on the 25th day of September last, from camp on the Sni, eight miles southwest of Lexington, leaving Company M at that place, and arrived at Sedalia on the 26th, where I was joined by major Mullins\u2019 battalion and Company K, and remained until the 29th and marched for Jefferson City, arriving there on the 1st day of October, when I was joined by Company B and remained until the 2d, and then marched to Mike Clark\u2019s Ford, on the Osage, with 200 men to guard that and other fords against the advance of Price\u2019s army. No enemy appearing I was ordered back to Jefferson City on the 5th, and at 5 a.m. on the 7th took position with my regiment in the rifle-pits on the extreme left of the defenses of the city and remained there during their during the fight and until Price\u2019s army had passed. On the 8th I joined other troops in the rear of Price\u2019s army, and on the evening of the 9th was present at the fight with his rear guard at California. On the 10th marched by way of Tipton and camped ten miles south of Boonville. On the 11th, by order of General Sanborn, I was sent with my regiment to reconnoiter the Boonville and Georgetown road to ascertain whether the enemy had moved west from Boonville or not. Found the road strongly picketed by the enemy and drove the pickets in; shortly afterward two squadrons, under the command of Major Mullins, charged a party of the enemy numbering about 100 who were marching on the road toward Boonville, and dispersed them. No casualties on our side; loss on the enemy not ascertained. After an examination of the road, and exhausting all sources of information, I became fully satisfied that no portion of the rebel army had moved west, and immediately sent a dispatch to General Sanborn to that effect and returned the same night to General Sanborn\u2019s camp, having traveled about twenty miles and completed the reconnaissance as directed. On the 12th marched to California after subsistence, and on the 13th returned to the Georgetown road and encamped about fifteen miles southwest of Boonville, Price\u2019s army in the meantime having moved to Saline county. On the 14th the command marched by way of Georgetown and encamped about eighteen miles west of Sedalia on the Lexington road. On the 15th marched to the vicinity of Cook\u2019s Store, in La Fayette County, and camped. On the 16th I was ordered by General Sanborn, with my regiment, to reconnoiter in the direction of Waverly, and if necessary visit that place to ascertain the position and movements of the enemy. I marched my regiment to the vicinity of Waverly and obtained the desired information. The sun was setting when we turned toward camp, twenty miles distant. Price\u2019s army, 20,000 strong, lay in and below Waverly. What seemed to be a large cloud of dust to the east and passing our rear admonished us that the enemy was making an effort to cut off our return. The darkness of the night favored us, and by taking a more westerly route than we had traveled in the day we escaped this force and also that commanded by Jeff. Thompson, who, returning from Sedalia laden with spoil, placed his men, 2000 strong, in ambush on the road we had passed over in the morning to intercept our return.\\nOn the 17th marched to Fisher\u2019s Creek, in Pettis County, and camped and remained there until the 19th, when we marched to Boonville, in Saline county. Here you assumed command of the First Brigade, of which my regiment formed a part, which from the time of leaving Jefferson City had, by order of General Sanborn, been under the command of Col. John F. Philips, Seventh Cavalry Missouri State militia. On the 20th we marched to Lewis\u2019 plantation, in La Fayette County. On the 21st marched to the Sni, eight miles southwest of Lexington. On the 22d marched to Independence, arriving there in the afternoon; I was immediately ordered to the front with my regiment at a gallop and to advance upon the enemy on the Kansas City road. after moving about half a mile from the town my advance was fired upon; my regiment was then dismounted, and all, except one company held in reserve, advanced against the enemy. It soon became apparent that the enemy in large force was posted in the timber that skirts the southwest portion of the town and held the fences and hedge in front of his position, and were attempting to flank my regiment on the right and left. This made it necessary to extend my lines to near three quarters of a mile in length. I now discovered that the enemy was increasing his forces and that my regiment was in imminent danger of being overpowered and cut to pieces. I immediately sent messengers to you with the information, and about this time I sent forward the company held in reserve to support the left in peril. After considerable delay, for which you were not responsible, I sent other messengers to you, and still others, in relation to our condition. After near one hour the Fourth Missouri State Militia appeared upon the ground, and shortly afterward a battalion of the Seventh Missouri State Militia, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Crittenden, who assisted by Neill\u2019s battalion, gallantly charged the enemy and drove him from his positions. As these respective commands arrived I sent them to the left, just in time to prevent disaster, and where up to this moment my gallant men, under the command of the heroic Neill, had maintained the protracted and unequal contest, while Mullins and Burris with their brave battalions held the overpowering force at bay on the right and in the center. In the meantime the enemy placed several pieces of artillery in position and were shelling my men furiously over the entire field. Shortly afterwards you arrived with two pieces of artillery and opened upon the enemy, and about the same time the remainder of the Seventh Missouri State Militia, under the command of Colonel Philips, also arrived and supported the artillery. During all this time the town of Independence was occupied in force by Federal soldiers, well supplied with artillery, and yet for near one hour my regiment with forlorn hope battled against fearful odds, perhaps ten times their numbers.\\nThe fight continued until sunset, when the enemy retreated toward the Blue, pursued by my regiment, assisting the advance of Colonel Winslow\u2019s brigade, and continued to press his rear in the darkness of the night, encountering at short intervals heavy volleys of musketry from the almost, concealed enemy, who slowly and stubbornly retreated. My men having traveled forty miles, and been engaged with the enemy since about 3 p. m., withdrew from the contest, and pursuant to orders remounted and moved forward with the brigade. The column continued to advance, Colonel Winslow\u2019s brigade being in the front; a few volleys more and the column halted at about 10 p. m., the conflict ending for the night. My men lay upon the road during the remainder of the night, holding their horses, both having been without food since the night previous, and orders were received to move, I was relieved of the command of my regiment by orders of Major General Pleasonton, without any cause being given. It is but justice in this connection to say that the regiment during the campaign, while under my command, nobly did its duty, and at the battle of Independence behaved with distinguished gallantry.\\nThe casualties in the campaign, while under my command, are as follows: In action October 6, 1864, on the Osage, below Jefferson City, Private Wright J. Hill, Company D, killed; Private Samuel Howard, Company D, mortally wounded; Sergt. James C. Triplett, company D, slightly wounded; Private Warren Mitchell, Company D, severely wounded; Private George Tyler, Company H, killed; Private John Harvey, company H mortally wounded; Private Jacob Evans, Company H, mortally wounded; private William Collier, Company H, mortally wounded. In action on the move west of Jefferson City, October 8, 1864, Sergt. William L. Powell, Company A, slightly wounded. At Sedalia, Mo., October 15, 1864, George Sparks, private, Company D, killed. At Georgetown, Mo., October 14, 1864, Lieutenant Triplett, Company D, was severely wounded by pistol shot, accidentally. In action at Independence, October 22, 1864, First Lieut. John D. Mullins, Company A, severely wounded; Private William H. Royston, Company A, severely wounded; Private Richard Owings, Company G, severely wounded; Corpl. James C. Wood, Company K, slightly wounded.\\nIn relation to the action on the Osage, below Jefferson City, October 6, 1864, you are respectfully referred to Major Mullins\u2019 official report, a copy of which is forwarded herewith, marked A.\\nThe loss sustained by the enemy in the several engagements is not known, but must have been severe.

You couldn\\'t get traction to run. It was extremely difficult and slowed everyone down in getting off the beach. You would dig a fox hole and it would collapse.\\nI can remember jumping into a hole and starting a conversation with a guy. It was a one sided conversation. I checked and he was dead. Wounded and dead were everywhere. You have to understand that almost 1800 guys were piling onto the beach from every wave. Too many guys were put on the beach at the same time.\\nI really feel that alot of the casualties resulted from the poor traction. You couldn\\'t go anywhere fast. So if you were getting shot at it was tough running on the beach. I think that\\'s why so many guys got hit. No where to go and everyone bunched up.\\nI finally saw a bunch of guys underneath a pill box. They weren\\'t getting shot at as the Japanese couldn\\'t get the angle. So I ran to where they were. Then I threw a couple of grenades up at the pillbox. Eventually some demolition guys came over and they put bangalore torpedos underneath. They called \"fire in the hole\". Then dropped the Pillbox down the hill. We cleaned it out and used it as a commo bunker with all of our radios.\\nThe medics got pretty busy. They did a tremendous job.\"\\nWhen did you know about Basilone getting hit?\\n\"It wasn\\'t for several days later that we found out. We were busy with are own stuff and when it came out that he was killed it overshadowed alot of other people who got killed. Basilone was famous because of his actions at Guadalcanal. Some high ranking officers were killed on Iwo. More was said about Basilone because of his exploits.\"\\nWhen did Jonesy get hit?\\n\"Jonesy got hit about eight or nine days after we landed. That was awful hard. I was close to him because we had formed a bond in combat. We had cleaned out caves together on Saipan. We lost so many guys in a short amount of time at Iwo.\\nI was sitting there on the beach after Jones got hit a second time in the landing craft. Another Marine came along and asked if I was OK. I said I am alive.\" The Marine replied. \" Ok grab your gear and move out . We got to get back up to the front.\" So off I moved. It wasn\\'t the same though.\" Jerry continued\\nI wasn\\'t really close in a sense to anyone else. Jones and I had a special bond. We had been through alot at Saipan. I went out for a beer with the replacements but it was different.\"(Back in Hawaii)\\nWe also didn\\'t experience any Banzai charges like on Saipan. The Japanese commander told each Imperial soldier to kill at least 10 of us. At the end sometime in March the Japs did launch a surprise attack on the airfield. Quite a few guys got killed. All the Japs were killed though.\"\\nJones suffered a leg injury where most of his leg was gone. A tourniquet was placed on his leg. Jerry and several Marines rushed him to the beach. Jones was put on an LCVP with other wounded Marines. As the boat was heading out to the hospital ship it took a direct hit. Jerry immediately swam out with other Marines and they brought the wounded to shore.\\nJones had now lost his left arm in addition to his leg. Jerry never says who, but I suspect he placed the tourniquet on Jones. Jerry put Jones along with the wounded on another boat and it went to the the hospital ship.\\nJerry got word several days later that Jones had died on the ship.\\nSome of you have heard a version of this story. This episode opened up some more chapters in Jerry\\'s life. It is the story of a Marine in combat. Hard and brutal. Somethings that won\\'t ever be forgotten. Jonesy and Jerry were tight. That was made very clear.\\n\"Just cruel and unusual punishment is all I can think of what happened. Guys getting hit multiple times. We\\'d fix a guy up and he\\'d get hit again. It was so unfair in a sense. I just still don\\'t understand why. To this day... I was just so very lucky. I never realized how lucky I really was. I found out not to long ago that of 900 guys that hit the beach at Iwo Jima in my unit, only 150 walked off.\" Jerry got that far away look and shrugged his shoulders.\\nWe spoke of things that took place in the days afterwards and then when he left Iwo. Higher Headquarters put out the word looking for volunteers to man the Navy Chow Lines. FOOD??? What Sherlock would say no to food? ( Damn near had a riot on Sunday when he was put on portions for dessert after Kegan\\'s confirmation.)\\nJerry left Iwo Jima and moved onto a US Navy ship. The Sailors treated him well upon arrival. Jerry prepped the chow on the Navy vessel.\\n\"I was pretty ragged. The sailors ran a hot shower and then put me in Navy dungarees. They made me steak and I got to eat plenty of ice cream. They really treated me very well. Eventually a Gunny caught up to me just before we got to Hawaii and told me to put on USMC dungarees. That was the end of that.\" That trademark grin and laugh.\\nJerry would commence training for an as of yet undetermined target. He felt that it may have been Honsho.\\nJack Sherlock was in a Tank Destroyer Battalion pushing through German lines.\\n\"My brother Jack was involved at the battle of the Remagen Bridge and helped capture it.\"\\nThat battle took place 7-8 March 1945. German troops did attempt to blew it but it was a low order detonation. The bridge was captured intact and vehicles got over it. The bridge finally did collapse on 17 March-1945.\\nGunnery Sgt. John Basilone lay at Iwo Jima unti his remains were moved to Arlington National Cemetary in 1948.\\n27 Medals of Honor were awarded for actions at Iwo Jima. 23 to US MARINES. 4 to Sailors.\\nThat would amount to 28% of the 82 Medals of Honor awarded to the Marine Corps in World War Two.\\nMore Medals of Honor then any other Battle to date.\\n25,851 casualties. 1 in 3 would die.\\n6,285 Americans were killed there. US Marines, Sailors and Coast Guardsmen.\\nOne of those was PFC Jones 1st JASCO 3rd BN 25th Marines 4th MARDIV from Colorado.\\n\"Among the men who fought at Iwo Jima, Uncommon Valor was a Common Virtue.\"\\nAdmiral ChesterW.

{"id":360,"question":"I work in precision medicine and I've noticed rapid changes in how genomic data is being utilized. Could you explain how the integration of genomic information into healthcare has progressed from early research applications to current clinical implementation?","gold":"The integration of genomic information into healthcare has evolved significantly from research-focused applications to becoming an essential clinical tool. Initially, the focus was primarily on research applications and concerns about data security, with early initiatives like the International Gene Synthesis Consortium screening individual synthetic-gene orders. Today, genomics has become a vital part of standard healthcare, enabling diagnosis of rare diseases, screening for disease risk genes, and developing individually tailored therapy approaches. This progression is evident in practical applications like the MASTER study, which demonstrates clear clinical benefits with new therapy suggestions for over 85% of cases and improved progression-free survival rates. The field is continuing to advance, as shown by Germany's 2021 law establishing a model project to integrate genomic medicine into daily clinical care starting in 2024. The implementation has been aided by technological advances that have dramatically decreased sequencing costs, making the technology more accessible, while improved bioinformatic methods have made sequencing a standard diagnostic technique.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:a64f4988-e39b-41d0-83f8-08b3f5eaf101>', '<urn:uuid:fa779899-b2d3-4d03-816d-dc848c5c3bbd>']","texts":"['June 1, 2017 (Vol. 37, No. 11)\\nDeeAnn Visk Ph.D. Founder and Principal Writer DeeAnn Visk Consulting\\nConsciousness-Expanding Biodata Exchanges Can Turn into Bad Trips\u2014Commercial Losses and Security Failures\\nWhen technology activists cry, \u201cInformation wants to be free,\u201d they relate just half of a thought first expressed by the writer, Silicon Valley futurist, and old sixties icon Stewart Brand. The rest of the thought, which dates back to a 1984 hackers\u2019 convention, reflects a more balanced outlook. Information, Brand clarified, also \u201cwants to be expensive\u2014because it\u2019s so valuable.\u201d\\nWhen \u201cfree\u201d enters information technology debates, it may refer to unemployed journalists, starving musicians, or frustrated movie executives. Or it may refer to leaks from whistleblowers, unfortunate e-mail caches, or cases of identity theft. Sometimes \u201cfree\u201d is about the freedom to avoid paying for anything. Sometimes it\u2019s about the freedom to skirt restrictions on distribution, use, modification, re-distribution, re-use, and so on.\\nBoth senses of \u201cfree\u201d\u2014gratis and libre\u2014apply not only to the sort of information at the center of most internet-related controversies, but also to the special kind of information that we call bioinformation. When bioinformation is free, it can be shared by researchers and lead to new life-enhancing products and services. But it can also be exploited by bad actors who might be interested in engineering new pathogens and sowing terror.\\nPlainly, bioinformation concerns both bioeconomic and biosecurity interests. Both wrestle with the need to balance freedom and control. They appreciate the freedom to innovate, provided it isn\u2019t abused by free riders, or perverted by those who would fashion weapons to cripple freedom. Yet there are also risks in clamping down on bioinformation, not the least of which are lost opportunities for new insights, new cures, and new wealth.\\nHow should bioinformation risks and opportunities be managed? Several answers to that question are provided by the experts who are cited in this article. By and large, they advocate a balanced approach, such as the one reached by Brand two decades after his LSD-fueled stint as a Merry Prankster. They recognize that any misuse of bioinformation could inspire bad actors to repeat Dr. Evil\u2019s take on the swinging sixties and sneer, \u201cFreedom failed.\u201d But they also know that biosecurity advocates could echo Austin Powers, who once said, \u201cRight now, we\u2019ve got freedom and responsibility. It\u2019s a very groovy time.\u201d\\nPrivacy and Competitiveness\\nEnormous compilations of data can be used to draw correlations about human health from genomic data and other data sources such as health history, leading to the development of new pharmaceuticals and treatments. The safeguarding of these compilations, especially as they pertain to human health and human genomics, concerns Edward You, supervisory special agent in the FBI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate, Biological Countermeasures Unit.\\n\u201cWith companies outsourcing the generation and storage of this data, they are leaving the safeguards in place within the United States,\u201d says Mr. You. \u201cHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy standards are not readily enforceable once the data leaves the borders of the United States. Hence, sensitive data is vulnerable to misappropriation by both companies and nation states.\u201d\\nThe U.S. remains in the forefront in the development of novel therapies, medications, devices, and approaches to human health. Much of this work is accomplished through the judicious use of vast quantities of data. While the laws and handling of this data with regards to privacy are well established and understood within the bounds of the U.S., it is easy to see how this information could be mishandled or stolen abroad, due to the lack of consideration for biosecurity issues.\\n\u201cDealing with the convergence of biology and big data and trying to assess ahead of time what the security implications will be, is a current challenge facing the United States,\u201d continues Mr. You. \u201cFor example, precision medicine approaches are a great application of big data and biological data, the bringing together of data from the \u2018omics\u2019 (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, etc.) along with other health-related data such as family history and medical records.\\n\u201cIf this data is coopted by bad actors, or nation states, and aggregated, it could provide a distinct advantage to the development of new pharmaceuticals, treatments, and approaches by companies outside of the United States. Is the United States really ready to give up its preeminent role in the world of innovation to other countries by not considering these factors?\u201d\\n\u201cWhen companies consider outsourcing the sequencing of human genomes, they need to consider the possibility that the data may also be copied by other parties, as well as returned to the company that ordered the datam,\u201d warns Mr. You. \u201cCompanies outside of the United States may offer great financial deals in the short term, but in the long term, this may prove detrimental to the dominant position of the United States in biotechnology and healthcare. All of the United States\u2019 trade agreements protect finished products; the issue here is the aggregation of raw data and how it can be analyzed and turned into innovation.\u201d\\nAnother important aspect of safeguarding the U.S. from biological threats (including radiological, chemical, and biological threats) involves outreach by the FBI. At 56 local FBI offices, there are special agents who serve as weapons of mass destruction coordinators. These coordinators work with first responders, public health officials, and law-enforcement personnel to answer biosecurity questions and resolve potentially dangerous situations. Additionally, these coordinators assist entities with guidance and threat assessment and work with corporate security.\\nTechnology and Security\\nThe idea that technology and technological diffusion relate to national security at strategic and operational levels is central to the work of Margaret Kosal, Ph.D., associate professor, Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, Georgia Institute of Technology. Much of her research focuses on reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\\n\u201cSometimes a seemingly innocuous project can take on more malevolent overtones,\u201d Dr. Kosal explains. \u201cFor example, a biotech company in southeast Asia decided to engineer a more potent form of the botulinum toxin. From a commercial point of view this makes sense, as less of the product would be needed to have the same effect in cosmetic and medical treatments. Unfortunately, from a biosecurity standpoint, this means the potency of a potential biological weapon increased.\u201d\\nDr. Kosal argues that when biotech companies approach projects, they should do more than just keep the bottom line in mind. They should also think about the biosecurity repercussions of their work before deciding to move ahead.\\nWeak Links in the Supply Chain\\nMark Greaves, Ph.D., technical director of analytics for the National Security Directorate at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, is preoccupied by a key question: \u201cHow can companies assist in promoting biosecurity?\u201d He also entertains a couple of related questions: \u201cHow can the National Laboratories help biotech companies avoid becoming unwitting participants in the creation of dangerous pathogens or toxins? What techniques can we develop to help companies encourage responsible science?\u201d\\nPart of what the National Security Directorate does is develop ways to mitigate security risks in biology supply chains without burdening normal commerce. \u201cWe can build from the methods we developed to help secure trade in dual-use nuclear technologies,\u201d Dr. Greaves explains. \u201cThe parallel isn\u2019t exact. For example, a major tool for limiting nuclear proliferation is to tightly control fissile material, but similarly controlling biological materials is not possible. So, we focus our attention on the biotech supply chain\u2014both the data flows and the intermediate physical products.\\n\u201cWe are developing lightweight techniques that can help companies in the biotech supply chain flag worrisome orders, such as an unusual set of items or problematic gene sequence, or orders from a non-bona fide person or facility. Helping companies develop a corporate culture where employees are actively encouraged to raise concerns with an order is another important component of promoting responsible biotechnology.\u201d\\nSuch concerns have been taken up by the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC), which was formed to prevent the misuse of gene-synthesis technology. The IGSC currently includes 80% of commercial gene synthesis capacity worldwide.\\nIn partnership with governments and other entities, the IGSC promotes the beneficial application of gene-synthesis technology and strives to safeguard biosecurity. One way the organization does this involves creating protocols for screening individual synthetic-gene orders as well as the customers who place them.\\n\u201cOne caveat to providing cybersecurity it the problem of evaluating the efficacy of the measures that are in place,\u201d comments Robert Sloan, Ph.D., professor of computer science and head of the computer science department at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cIn order to evaluate computer security, one has to practically be an expert oneself to determine if cybersecurity measures are efficacious and cost-effective.\u201d\\nThere are varied solutions out there for computer security, explains Dr. Sloan, who adds that these solutions also have varied prices, some of which exceed the cost of fixing the sort of data breaches that the solutions are meant to prevent.\\n\u201cOne way to conceptualize computer security is to think of home security,\u201d suggests Dr. Sloan. \u201cIf a house contains many valuables (computer data), then security needs to be higher than a home without much information of value. Also, the home of well-known persons or entities needs more security than the average American.\\nSharing Data, Sharing Genes\\n\u201cMost genetic signals related to health can be found only by integrating information across many genomes,\u201d observes Nathan Price, Ph.D., associate director and professor at the Institute for Systems Biology. \u201cThus, without data sharing, no individual\u2019s genome data would be of much value, including to the person him or herself. If all the genomes in the world were sequenced and none of them were shared, then there would be little value in all that sequencing because we wouldn\u2019t much understand what any of it meant.\\n\u201cWhile data security is clearly very important, this need is counterbalanced by the need for data to be shared to be interpretable. This is the basis for the challenges that must be met for safe data-sharing with qualified people and trusted organizations so that the benefits to the individual and to society can be maximized.\\n\u201cMost people who want to analyze human genomes are highly motivated by wanting to help people and advance the cause of human health and wellbeing. However, issues around potential misuses of these data are clearly important. The threat of an ill-intentioned group using genomic data, for example, to design a virus that afflicts one ethnic group over another would be a terrible outcome.\\n\u201cHowever, such events are unlikely to occur. Often people who use genetics to determine their ethnic heritage are surprised to learn how mixed they are through the diversity of their ancestors. It is unlikely that a bioterrorist could use genomic data to design a bioweapon that affects just one ethnic group or, conversely, does not affect a particular ethnic group.\u201d\\n\u201cWhile this is clearly improving dramatically over time, humans as a group can tend to see themselves as different or separate from people of other ethnicities,\u201d concludes Dr. Price. \u201cIn truth, we are much more mixed than some might think, based on genomic analysis. The beautiful truth emphasized by studying genomics is the oneness of the human family.\u201d\\nReaching consensus on the interpretation of a raw dataset is another challenge inherent with Big Data. \u201cIf you present the same raw dataset to five different bioinformaticians, you will get five different answers,\u201d contends Folker Meyer, Ph.D., computational biologist and deputy division director of biology at Argonne National Laboratory. \u201cAdditionally, the primary data in DNA\/RNA sequencing is frequently lost. Only the processed data (which is frequently massively biased) is saved, making retrospective analysis with improved or different methods nearly impossible.\\n\u201cEach person comes at data analysis with a slightly different approach. Also, the person doing the analysis is generally not the principle investigator, but a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow, which is to say, someone who is more comfortable running the software analysis of the raw data. Hence, the person in charge relies on the judgements of more junior members of the group.\\n\u201cAnother issue is getting actionable data from the analysis for human health. To truly evaluate what the impact is on patient treatment, an individual would need a deep understanding of the analysis and medical practice; those individuals are rare.\u201d\\n\u201cThe last problem is that the cost of data analysis is not factored in,\u201d adds Dr. Meyer. \u201cData acquisition is much cheaper than it was at the time of Darwin\u2019s voyage. For example, generating DNA sequencing data is cheap. Still, costs tend to accumulate during data analysis, which requires massive computing power and a diverse set of computing, math, statistical, and analytical skills. Few biologist have the specialized training for this work. The cost of this is often overlooked in budgets.\u201d\\nData Science Investments\\nBig Data approaches are being used to analyze complex biological systems. For example, Ivo Dinov, Ph.D., associate professor in the department of health behavior and biological sciences at the University of Michigan, is working to improve the management of Big Data.\\n\u201cWe have developed protocols for data wrangling, harmonization, aggregation, processing, model-based and model-free inference, and visualization,\u201d informs Dr. Dinov. \u201cOnce all the details are worked out, the implications for pharmaceutical companies may be enormous\u2014from expediting drug discovery to improving prediction of treatment outcomes.\\n\u201cFinancial rewards are likely to be huge in the long run. In the immediate future, we need a massive investment in basic, transdisciplinary, and data-driven sciences.\u201d\\nDr. Dinov insists that long-term investments will yield substantial dividends, but he recognizes that tightfisted players will fail to seize the opportunities ahead. \u201cThe shortsighted may meet near-term fiscal expectations but miss the coming economic tidal wave,\u201d he cautions.\\n\u201cBenefits to patients will be substantial,\u201d Dr. Dinov continues. \u201cNo medical treatments are guarantee complete success. Nonetheless, effective, predictive Big Data analytics will reduce risks, tighten confidence limits, improve forecasting, and expedite medical decision-making.\u201d\\nWith all these benefits promised by combining Big Data, biosecurity, and biotechnology, scientists, business people, and government officials need to be aware of the risks and opportunities of allowing domestically generated bioinformation to be amassed abroad. Protocols for the sharing of bioinformation must be carefully balanced to facilitate discovery while safeguarding privacy, protecting commercial interests, and maintaining the common defense.\\nPrecision Medicine Exchange Consortium\\nAdvances in genomic profiling are producing a wealth of information about the biological mechanisms of cancer. Translating this information into better treatments depends on a multistakeholder collaboration that promotes broad access to large, diverse datasets that can help us make connections between genomics and clinical outcomes.\\nTwo years ago, Foundation Medicine (FMI) launched the Precision Medicine Exchange Consortium (PMEC), which is designed to facilitate information-sharing by breaking down barriers between institutions. PMEC unites academic centers, regional hospital systems, and community oncology networks under a single, secure data umbrella to establish a combined knowledgebase that can simultaneously inform patient treatment today while optimizing future drug discovery and development.\\n\u201cAdvancing cancer care is greater than any single institution,\u201d said Gaurav Singal, M.D., vice president, data strategy and product development at FMI. \u201cAll of us in the global oncology community recognize the importance of collaboration to remove silos and enable discoveries that ensure patients benefit from the full potential of genomic data.\u201d\\nLast year, FMI contributed 18,000 de-identified adult genomic profiles to the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Genomic Data Commons Portal, more than doubling its size at the time. FMI also shared profiles of more than 1,200 pediatric tumors to stimulate research in childhood cancer. Additionally, a groundbreaking partnership between FMI and Flatiron Health facilitated a real-world dataset that links genomic and clinical outcomes data for over 20,000 patients to identify actionable biomarkers in lung and other cancers.\\nNewer precision technologies, like liquid biopsy, can especially benefit and advance by sharing insights. FMI is partnering with government, academia, pharmaceutical, and diagnostic experts via the Blood Profiling Atlas, which aggregates clinical data for researchers to speed development of blood profiling technologies.\\nAs walls continue to fall, multi-institutional data-sharing initiatives hold the promise to make meaningful strides in improving diagnostic technologies, drug development, and cancer care.', 'The impact data sharing and GHGA can have for disease communities.\\nRegardless of research or clinical care, data is power. Genomic information from one individual only holds that much information. Only when combining data from larger cohorts will research gather the power for robust results and new scientific discoveries.\\nGHGA aims to bring these data treasures together and unlock the data\u2019s full potential. Sharing data, in a protected and safe manner, enables scientific discovery and the development of diagnostic tools and therapies.\\nOmics is a vital part of biomedical research and increasingly part of standard health care\\nRapid technological advances have dramatically decreased sequencing costs, making the technology affordable and accessible for researchers. In addition, advanced bioinformatic methods have made sequencing a standard research and diagnostics technique causing a vast amount of data being produced. The rapid growth of available data is a major challenge, but also an unprecedented opportunity for research.\\nGenomic data is becoming an increasingly important tool in healthcare. It allows the diagnosis of (rare) diseases whose underlying genetic modifications can often only be identified by genome sequencing. Screening for disease risk genes (e.g. cancer) can also assist in disease prevention, allowing closer medical precautions of individuals at risk. Individually tailored therapy approaches based on genome analysis account for biological variation in patients and have tremendous potential in helping patients not responding to standardised therapy approaches. So from cancer to rare diseases, genomics can greatly help with monitoring and improving health conditions and save lives.\\nGenomic data is sensitive, and patients know that. Yet patients are willing to donate their data to science - hoping to help future patients with new developments in science. A study involving cancer patients found that 97 percent are generally willing to make clinical data available for biomedical research purposes. The major condition for their consent? High data security. A goal GHGA strives towards.\\nSo far, molecular analysis of genomic data for diagnosis or personalised therapies is not part of standard health care in Germany. However, this is about to change. In 2021, a new law laid the legal groundwork for a model project aiming to integrate genomic medicine in daily clinical care over 5 years starting in 2024.\\nAlready, omics can have a big impact on health care. Here we highlight five examples, where omics data have the potental to revolutionise health care and explain how GHGA is part of this process.\\nWithout genome research the corona pandemic would have been very different. We would not have been able to decode the SARS-CoV-2 genome, develop a vaccine in record breaking time, or monitor emerging variants and thereby inform public health policy. Without sequencing of human host genomes, we would not have been able to predict individual risk factors. Data sharing enables and accelerates research discovery. In crisis situations, the need to share research data quickly, yet securely, is most pressing. Establishing infrastructure to facilitate secure, yet democratic data access for legitimate research questions will provide Germany with a solid foundation for the future. During the corona pandemic GHGA was part of the CoGDat initiative, and established a portal to collect and share Sars-CoV-2 raw sequencing data, enabling molecular surveillance of virus variants across Germany.\\nComprehensive genomic and transcriptional analysis can enable personalised medicine and improve patient care. The ongoing multicenter observational NCT\/DKFZ\/DKTK MASTER (Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumour Eradication Research) study demonstrates that molecular analysis provides diagnostic and therapeutic benefits for rare cancer patients. Using standardised precision oncology workflow, the tumour genome of the patient is sequenced and bioinformatically analysed. The results are discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board and evidence-based clinical care recommendations are given accordingly. With new therapy suggestions for more than 85% of cases and increased progression-free survival rates for up to a third of patients, the MASTER program proves the clinical use case for genome medicine and underlines the need for reference data. The MASTER data-set will be one of the first data sets available within GHGA.\\nRare diseases are caused by variants in the genetic code and are often rare in the general population. The identification of these rare genetic changes relies on a large collection of reference genomes to which the patient genome can be compared to. The rarer the disease the larger the data sets need to be in order to find the genetic abnormality. For cases occurring with a frequency of 1 in 1 000 000, a cohort of 100 million genomes is needed to robustly call rare disease cases. Only if large reference data sets are established and shared across clinics can the diagnosis of patients be successful. The impact of a swift and correct diagnosis and disease treatment or management is an immense success for the individual patients - but it also eases the pressure on the health care system. Using sequencing techniques early in the diagnostic process can more than triple the diagnostic rate, at one-third of the cost per diagnosis. GHGA is closely working together with the rare disease community to ensure that e.g. workflows tailored to their community needs are being provided.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already widely used in healthcare, with increasing fields of application: robot assisted surgery, apps to help with the identification of skin cancers, evaluation of MRI and X-ray images, wearables for diabetes patients, fitness trackers, etc. Large datasets are needed to train the AI algorithms behind the applications. The further expansion of AI assisted health care has the potential to save billions of US$ per year, worldwide. GHGA will provide secure access to large, homogenised data sets to enable and promote AI-based big data analysis for reserach porpuses.\\nThe German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie) is a long-term population study organised and conducted by a network of German research institutions. The aim is to shed light on the causes of common diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases, and to uncover the role of e.g. environmental factors, nutrition, lifestyle and our genes. The comprehensive health data collection from a total of 200,000 participants, now expanding to omics data, will serve to elucidate the causes and risk factors of these widespread diseases, as well as identify opportunities for early detection and prevention. The omics data will be stored within GHGA - making this large population-based data set also available for secondary research use.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"temporal-evolution","error":null,"n":2}
{"id":298,"question":"what is the numerical range of probability values discussed in bayesian statistical analysis","gold":"According to the mathematical definition discussed, probability takes on values between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a more certain outcome.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:989d94fe-b8a1-4f89-bc36-ced1898aa626>']","texts":"['Everyday use of a mathematical concept\\nThe concept of probability is not alien to even the least mathematically versed among us: even those who do not remember the basic math they had in primary schools use it currently in their daily reasoning. I find the liberal use of the word \"probability\" (and derivates) in common language interesting, for two reasons. One, because the word has in fact a very definite mathematical connotation. And two, because the word is often used to discuss the knowledge of a system\\'s evolution in time without a clear notion of which, among either of two strikingly different sources, is the cause of our partial or total ignorance.\\n1. As far as the mathematical flavour of the word is concerned, it is sufficient to note that its loose usage directly involves the eyeballing of a real number taking on values between 0 and 1. Whether you are talking about the chance that a colleague missed the train given that she is not showing up, or whether you am wondering who might win at Roland Garros next June, the moment you say \"Susan is usually on time, so it is highly probable that she missed the train\" or \"Nadal has a high probability of winning next year, especially if Federer does not play\" you are guessing that a real number is significantly larger than zero. You might even inconsciously be assigning it a definite value, if you are taking a decision: start the meeting anyways, or accept your friend\\'s bet against Nadal.\\n2. Few of us, in using the word \"probability\", spend a moment of their time pondering on the real meaning of the word, and the fact that what it usually does for us is to explicitate our imperfect knowledge of the state of a system, or, in many cases, its past or future evolution in time. Our ignorance may be due to two quite different sources, although we usually fail to realize the difference: the intrinsic randomness of the phenomenon we are considering (say, if we try to predict the future, like the participation list of next years\\' Roland Garros), or the insufficient data at our disposal on a system which is perfectly deterministic, id est one that has already taken a definite state, however unknown to us (Susan took the train or missed it).\\nNote that for statisticians the above statements on Susan or Nadal are guesses, not estimates: estimates come exclusively from measurements! Yet similar sentences get as close as anything to scientific thinking for non-scientists in their everyday life. The reason why they do is that they implicitly use Bayesian reasoning. If you do not know what Bayesian reasoning is, read on: you might realize you are smarter than you thought.\\nTwo schools of thought\\nThere are two schools of thought when discussing the probability of different hypotheses. One school is called \"Frequentist\". If I were using frequentist thinking, I would say that observing the behavior of an infinite number of readers N of this post would allow me to compute the probability that you leave it before getting to the end, by taking the limit, for large N, of the fraction of departures divided by N.\\nThe other one is called \"Bayesian\" after Thomas Bayes, who formulated in the mid 1700s the famous theorem named after him. Bayes\\' theorem was published postumously in 1763 by a friend, who beat on time the mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace. For a Bayesian, probability is not a number defined as a fraction of outcomes, but rather a quantity defined irrespective of the possibility of actually counting a fraction of successes: one which has to do with the degree of belief of the experimenter. This belief sizes up the likelihood one may assign to the occurrence of a phenomenon, based on his or her prior knowledge of the system.\\nBeing a Bayesian -at least in everyday life-, instead of fantasizing about infinite readers I use my prior experience on similar articles I wrote, and the data provided in this blog\\'s access statistics, to try and put together my guess: in statistical jargon, I assign a \"subjective prior probability\" to the dropping out of readers during a long piece, depending on its length and subject. Since the number in this case comes out pretty close to unity -a certain outcome-, let me get to the heart of this post quickly. I want to convince you that you, too, are a Bayesian. But I need to explain you the theorem first!\\nIf you are here in search of a rigorous definition, you have come to the wrong place. I will give in the following a simplified, inaccurate explanation of this important tool in statistics, by considering an example. As I just had occasion to note, I am a Statistician only by election...\\nIt all revolves around the meaning of conditional probability. We may call C a restricting condition on the occurrence of a phenomenon A, and write the probability of occurrence of the condition C as P(C). Similarly, the probability of the phenomenon A may be labeled P(A), and the probability of occurrence of A under the restricting condition that C also occurs as P(A|C).\\nIn our Nadal\/Federer example above, we might assign to C the meaning \"Federer plays Roland Garros 2010\"; A will mean \"Nadal wins RG2010\", and A|C is what we want to know, namely \"Nadal wins RG2010 if Federer plays\". Bayes\\' theorem then can be stated as follows:\\nThe probability P(A|C) that \"Nadal wins RG2010 if Federer plays\" can be computed as the product of three terms: P(A), the probability that Nadal wins; P(C|A), the likelihood that Federer plays if Nadal wins; and 1\/P(C), the inverse of the probability that Federer plays. In symbols,\\nP(A|C) = P(A) P(C|A) \/ P(C).\\nLet us give P(A) a 30% chance: the overall chance that Nadal wins. This is our subjective prior, our degree of belief on Nadal winning. Then if P(C), the chance that Federer participates, is 90%, and the likelihood of Federer being there if Nadal wins is 60%, we get for P(A|C) the number of 0.3*0.6\/0.9=0.2, or 20%. In this example, a good part of the chance of Nadal winning Roland Garros comes from Federer not coming. Note that somebody else might assign a different probability to P(A), and his result for P(A|C) will in general be different. This is at the heart of what makes Bayes theorem controversial among Statisticians.\\nI think what is counter-intuitive in Bayes Theorem is the fact that to compute a conditional probability P(A|C) we need to consider the case where we switch the place of the conditioning clause and the main phenomenon which is the object of our attention, by evaluating P(C|A). But there is really nothing mysterious, if you consider a graphical interpretation of the theorem.\\nTo interpret the figure above, which I have stolen from the enlightening slides of a course held last summer by a colleague, you are asked to liken probabilities to areas on a plane. Our \"universe of possibilities\" is the big rectangular box; then, the occurrence of phenomena in this universe can be represented by smaller areas within the box. The other thing you need in order to decrypt the slide is the meaning of symbols of union of sets and intersection of sets: A \"U\" symbol between two clauses labels \"union\", and indicates the logical or of two clauses, while the symbol looking like a upside-down \"U\" labels \"intersection\", and indicates the logical and of the two clauses.\\nI find the graphical demonstration above quite simple to grasp, and I hope you will concur. I have always wanted to put together a similar slide but I was happy to be saved the work... Thanks Bob!\\nI think you will be wondering why on earth you should consider yourself a Bayesian, since the theorem above looks obscure to you and you never even dreamt of computing conditional probabilities or subjective priors. Well, I think you do, inconsciously. When you have to take a decision in your daily life you are most likely to rely on your past experience on similar situations, but in the toughest cases that experience will not be available, and what you will draw from it will be a \"degree of belief\", which you build by extrapolation or other kinds of logical reasoning. If you ask yourself what is the chance that Susan took the car to drive to work today, if she is not there by the time the meeting starts, you will need to consider the probability that Susan is late at work when she takes the car, and this may be known to you from past experience; but you also need the overall probability of Susan taking the car, and this might be only available to you as a personal degree of belief. You will most probably not end up multiplying P(took car) by P(late|took car) to get your feeling on the chance that she is arriving by car, but your intuition will be based on those concepts anyway.\\nThen, there is another reason why you are probably using Bayesian reasoning in your everyday life, and that is its application to risk analysis. But I think I need to stop this article here: my risk analysis of dropping readers makes the price of writing another page not worth the while... It will be a wonderful topic for another post, if I manage to put together a few particle physics examples. Not your everyday bread and butter, I know, but at least more interesting than discussing chances of winning at the Casino.

You can control the accessibility features easier and also tailor the home to your preferences and needs. If you\\'re in the position to be planning your own accessible home, here are 5 tips for any homeowner.\\nLearn the ADA standards. The Department of Justice has a number of recommendations (mandatory elements of certain buildings) for accessibility that you can use to help guide you and your contractor in how wide to make traffic areas (such as the 60\" minimum for a U-shaped kitchen), what height to make counters and what special considerations to use when buying accessories.\\nUse an Open Plan. To avoid many maneuvering difficulties, it\\'s good to aim for an open layout as much as possible. Not only does this make it easier for a handicapped family member to use, but it also helps keep the family feeling less isolated and is generally more inclusive. When designing the separate rooms, be sure that there are few or no barriers or changes in elevation at entry points.\\nShort, Wide Hallways. It\\'s probably best to avoid unnecessary hallways, which can prove to be difficult to maneuver if too long, too narrow or with too many angles. To avoid these problems, plan for a wide hallway -- probably at least 3 to 4 feet in width -- that is as short as you can get away with.\\nGive Attention to the Accessible Bathroom. The bathroom that will be most often used by the handicapped user should be designed larger than necessary to make it easier to use. Be sure to leave more than the minimum of space around main items like the shower, tub, toilet and sink. You can find chic versions of many accessible features like a pedestal sink, matching grab bars and fixtures, roll-in showers and walk-in bathtubs, like from http:\/\/www.twincitystairlifts.com. Even simple things like a bench in the shower can be both functional and beautiful.\\nBuy Accessible Appliances. When they think about increasing accessibility for appliances, many people think about lowering items. And this is true for many things (like sinks), there are also other things you can do to help. Raising the dishwasher can make it easier to use. In addition, opt for a refrigerator\/freezer combo with the freezer on the bottom and a range with staggered burners to prevent burns. Use lower shelving or cabinets to hold small appliances -- including a microwave, blender, coffee machine or food processor.\\nBy designing your own house to meet your family\\'s individualized accessibility needs, you can create a home that everyone will love and be able to thoroughly enjoy for years to come.Share\\n8 July 2016\\nHaving a daughter comes with a number of challenges.

They are designed to provide you and your loved ones with a means of escape or rescue during a fire or other emergency. Modern building codes require that all homes have egress windows in the basement and in all bedrooms throughout the house\\nProfessional Egress Window Cutting is a specialty service that Accurate Concrete Cutting and Drilling LLC is proud to offer. Whether you\u2019re building a new home or upgrading the windows in an existing home, you\u2019ll want our help. We understand all of the applicable building codes and have the equipment and knowledge necessary to provide you with fast, easy egress window cutting.\\nEgress Windows are Required by Law\\nAt Accurate Concrete Cutting and Drilling LLC, we offer egress window cutting services that adhere to all applicable building codes. Our team understands that building codes for egress windows must be followed for both new construction and installation in an existing foundation or building. In fact, any windows that are replaced in an older home, must adhere to current building codes.\\nThroughout the United States, almost all building codes and standards are set by the International Code Council (ICC). The ICC building codes \u2014 including the International Residential Code (IRC) \u2014 are updated every three years and have are designed to ensure that new buildings and newly remodeled buildings are safe for those who occupy them. IRC Section R310 addresses the requirement for egress windows.\\nReferring to the requirements for egress windows, the IRC states that \u201cbasements and every sleeping room shall have at least one operable emergency and rescue opening.\u201d There is, however, an exception in place for basements that are smaller than 200 square feet and used solely for housing mechanical equipment.\\nEgress Windows Legal Size Requirements\\nUnder IRC Section R310, all egress windows must meet certain size requirements. These size requirements apply to the size of the window opening, not the overall window size, and must be met when the window is in the full open position. Here are some of the legal size requirements for egress windows under the current IRC:\\n- Minimum Sill Height: The bottom sill of an egress window cannot be more than 44 inches above the floor. This is to ensure that the window is accessible in an emergency.\\n- Minimum Opening Area: Most egress windows must have at least 5.7 square feet of clear opening when fully open. The only exception to this is for ground floor egress openings which must have at least 5 square feet of clear opening.\\n- Minimum Opening Width: Openings must be at least 20 inches in width.\\n- Minimum Opening Height: Openings must be at least 24 inches in height.\\n- Minimum Window Well Size: Egress windows that open below ground level must open into a window well that is at least 9 square feet in size, and cannot be smaller than 36 inches on any one side. All egress window wells must allow the window to be fully opened.\\nLadder\/Steps Depth Requirement: If the window well is deeper than 44 inches, it must be equipped with a permanent ladder or steps that are accessible when the window is fully open.\\nOther Egress Window Legal Requirements\\n- Egress windows must open directly onto a public road or alley, or a yard or court that has access to a public road or alley.\\n- All egress windows have to be easily openable from the inside \u201cwithout the use of keys, tools or special knowledge.\u201d\\n- Window well coverings for egress windows must meet the same opening size requirements as egress windows and be easily released or removed from the inside \u201cwithout the use of a key, tool, special knowledge or force greater than that which is required for normal operation of the escape and rescue opening.\u201d\\nWhile not common, emergency escape windows can be installed under porches or decks as long as the positioning allows the window to be fully opened and a path of at least 36 inches in height provides access to a yard or court.\\nEgress Window Cutting by Accurate Concrete Cutting\\nBecause most basements in the area are constructed of heavy materials like concrete or cinder block, cutting egress windows yourself can be a difficult and dangerous undertaking. Here at Accurate Concrete Cutting, we specialize in both residential and commercial concrete cutting, supply, and construction. That means that our team is specially trained to provide you with fast, safe egress window cutting.\\nWe service areas throughout Southeast Idaho and Western Wyoming, so Contact Us Today to find out if our egress window cutting services are right for you!']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"comparison","error":null,"n":2}

He nearly bankrupted Constantinople to build it. The city watched one fountain after another dry up \u2014 all the pipes had been melted down to make gutters for the new church. The teachers in the schools were starving. The poor were poorer, and the rich complained of being somewhat less rich. But the church was going up, and for a while Justinian hardly seemed to care about anything else.\\nHis architect, Anthemius, was a brilliant but slightly eccentric engineer. Anthemius invented a kind of searchlight, and he used it to play practical jokes on his neighbors. He also invented a steam engine, but it was only a mechanical toy. Anthemius was just the sort of mildly unbalanced architect who would try something just because it was supposed to be impossible, and just the sort to build the most magnificent church in the world \u2014 or die trying.\\nThe impossible problem was this: how do you give a building both light and space? The bigger the building, the heavier the roof. The heavier the roof, the thicker the supports it needs, and the less space there is for letting in light.\\nAnthemius\u2019 answer was a huge, shallow dome. It ought to have been impossible. Nothing like it had ever been done before \u2014 a big dome usually has to be tall, like the dome of St. Peter\u2019s in Rome or the Capitol in Washington, in order to hold itself up. Even if the dome could be built, the supports for it would have to be so thick that they would ruin the effect of light and space.\\nBut nothing seemed impossible for Anthemius. He solved the problem by setting the dome on half-domes, so that the whole structure could rest on four widely spaced piers. Around the circumference of the dome were so many windows that the dome seemed to float over the church. Provincial visitors sometimes believed the story that the dome hung from heaven on a golden chain.\\nAnthemius had solved the impossible problem\u2014at least so it seemed. When Justinian finally entered the finished church, he looked up at a mosaic picture of Solomon. \u201cGlory to God,\u201d said the Emperor, \u201cwho has found me worthy to finish such a great work \u2014 surpassing even you, Solomon.\u201d\\nA few years later, the impossible dome fell down.\\nEven making the dome slightly taller didn\u2019t solve the structural problems. But the dome was too beautiful to give up on. When it was rebuilt for the last time, the builders took no chances. Exceptionally holy men came to spit some of their holiness into the mortar. A saint\u2019s relic was built into every twelfth course of bricks. And every brick was stamped with the initials of the verse, \u201cGod is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved.\u201d\\nWith all that supernatural help, the dome stayed up. Earthquakes, sieges, and periods of neglect have taken their toll on the building, but with the help of occasional emergency repairs, the dome is still there today \u2014 though the building the Turks call \u201cAya Sofia\u201d is now a state-run museum.

Like seasoned fishermen, they\u2019ll spin you some tall yarn about the bumper honey crops they got before chalkbrood, small hive beetle or American Foul Brood came along. Them were the Halcyon Days.\\nWell anyway, there are a few well known practical ploys I and many others in the club practice to stop bees swarming.\\nSwarming or Supersedure?\\nSeeing queen cells in a hive sets most beekeepers off. But don\u2019t assume your hive is about to swarm though that\u2019s pretty likely. Let\u2019s be clear. In the normal course of events there are a couple of reasons why bees need to raise queens . When you do something silly like squish a queen, the bees simply set to and raise a newbie. But there are two less tangible reasons why the bees need to replace their reigning queen.\\nFirstly to survive a colony must replace its queen now and then. Like any mum, the queen grows old and she needs to rely on a daughter to keep the family name going. An old queen allows her robots (aka almost sterile female workers) to raise a few daughters and one of them takes over the colony. Unlike children who get kicked out of home, this daughter knocks off her rivals as there is only room for one. Remember that beekeeping course: one hive, one queen. From the colony (or super-organism) perspective this replacement is non-reproductive in the sense that it\u2019s the colony, not the queen or drones or workers, that must survive. We call this supersedure.\\nSupersedure usually goes unnoticed but seeing supersedure cells is often mistaken as a portent of swarming.\\nSo before you reach for the hive tool to remove those cells carefully put it aside or mark the top bar and examine other brood frames. Count them and if there are no more than four or five cells (often just one or two) located in the centre of the brood nest then supersedure not swarming is taking place. Leave a few good lookers and put the lid back on your hive.\\nIt will take several weeks for the new queen to take and several more for your hive to kick along. Quite often the old queen will limp along and even lay alongside her daughter. That\u2019s why, when we requeen, we always inspect other brood frames once we\u2019ve found the queen we want to replace. We\u2019ve found half a dozen colonies with two queens in the club apiary and that\u2019s saved a few failed introductions.\\nWith supersedure, the bees are telling you they need a new queen and your knocking off their replacement risks making the colony queenless. At the very best, it will put them them back a couple of weeks while they try again.\\nSwarming is quite different. If you find lots of cells, and they are mainly hanging on the bottom of combs, then you are about to lose half or more of the productive capacity of your bees. The colony is about to reproduce itself (swarm). All that is happening is the colony spilts into two (and occasionally more) colonies. If you are curious and want to know more about the process read the famous Farmers Bulletin article by Demuth (Readings).\\nRemarkably, if your colony swarms it, too, ends up with a daughter queen. It\u2019s just that the old queen takes off with your bees and your queen to found a new colony elsewhere. You are left wondering if it might have been otherwise. These days, once you have some inkling that your bees might be preparing to swarm you can adopt any one of a few sure fire control measures.\\nSwarming \u2013 a Reality Check\\nBees have never had any choice. They\u2019ve always swarmed, and then many many times over their long period of evolution. That started about 40 million years ago from the first recording of Apis in fossil amber. Go back further to around 90 million years when the common progenitor of the honey, stingless, bumble and orchid bees first assembled for their mutual benefit and started sharing tasks such as defending the patch and ceding laying responsibility to mainly one queen and the one drone she mated with.\\nSocial bees must replace some colonies to make up for any that are lost, those that die of natural causes such as disease and starvation. Of course there are other causes of loss amongst honey bees, predation by bears and honey hunters and now attack by small hive beetle to name but a few.\\nBees swarm naturally, mainly in spring but only under good conditions. This they mostly do early in the season. This gives the swarm, and the parent colony, plenty of time to settle, build up in numbers, build stores and survive another winter.\\nBut you have a choice. You can let your bees swarm \u2013 and lose that good queen and a hell of a lot of honey \u2013 or you can sensibly intervene. Instead of relying on cutting out swarm cells \u2013 miss one and they will swarm \u2013 why not adopt very simple swarm control practices once your bees are quite strong and well before they actually head off to the never never. Removing queen cells only buys you 2-3 weeks reprieve when, if you don\u2019t get back to them, the bees will swarm anyway.\\nThe club has lost one swarm over the past two years. Think about it. Most colonies, even with queens replaced annually, will swarm every year so it makes sense to understand the basics and take action.\\nThere is Super Reversal, not a dinkum swarm control measure but which, in practice, will delay swarming. Anyway it\u2019s a pretty handy management tool for hurrying your bees along. Then there is The Colony Split. It works like a charm but it requires extra gear and you have to be aware that it will take many weeks for the colonies \u2013 especially the queenless part \u2013 to fully recover and be ready for the main honey flow. Finally there is the much maligned and often misunderstood Demaree Plan. It works a treat and has the great advantage of keeping your bees together under the one lid.\\nThere are many ways to impede the swarming impulse and one is Super Reversal. A couple of years back \u2013 in fact on the first day of spring \u2013 a quick whip around the club apiary showed that, in all but one Langstroth, every one had eaten their way through all their lower brood box stores. The brood and queen had moved upstairs. The beggars were chewing into remaining stores and would soon have starved. They weren\u2019t about to swarm but we did swap the boxes around as shown \u2013 and then fed them heavily \u2013 to give them a good start. Soon enough however it was time to reverse the boxes again, or at least consolidate as much brood as possible in the lower brood chamber.\\nBy reversing supers, the queen moves down with the brood while the bees move honey up and to fill up the combs under the lid as any extra brood in the upper box emerges. This simulates a light honey flow and stimulates the queen to lay. Hence more pheromones are moved around and this makes the colony less inclined to swarm.\\nTake care. Don\u2019t reverse supers if the nights are cold as you may be spitting the brood nest and there is a severe risk of losing brood to chilling.\\nThe Colony Split\\nWhen we approached Jim Calokerinos to revisit his no-swarm solution to beekeeping this cunning old beekeeper had done his OT trick. Jim had evaporated to Greece (Over There) to avoid Canberra\u2019s winter chills.\\nJim splits his hives every spring once they get up real muscle. Not surprisingly, if you suddenly halve the work force and halve the amount of brood they have, they don\u2019t swarm. It\u2019s as though you\u2019ve done the swarming for them and hey they stay at home to regain honey gathering strength, but not in the neighbours brick wall. More surprisingly, Jim simply reunites the colonies at the beginning of the honey flow and harvests the bumper honey crop as fast as it comes in.\\nJim is never fooled by the old adage of \u2018more bee hives equals more honey\u2019. He knows full-well that too many colonies means too much work and that swarming will rob you of the honey you might have had. By the time the main honey flow commences, normally November, bees have largely given up their swarming intent and returned to their serious honey gathering pursuit. Jim simply pastes his colonies back together to form giant colonies in order brings home the bacon, err, sorry honey.\\nNarrabundah Lane Apiary September 2015: L to R\\nHerb Waldie, John Howe, Adrain Wright,\\nJim Calokerinos and Dick Johnston\\nLet\u2019s say we start with a colony that comes out of winter well with good stores and plenty of bees. It builds quickly so we reverse supers, pop an excluder on and put on another full depth box or a couple of half depth boxes so the bees have room to raise brood and also to store honey. Putting more gear on works but only for a while. As soon as the bees are very strong, or actually begin building swarm cells, we split the whole caboodle into two colonies so that one retains the old queen (OQ) and the other has no queen (NQ). Pretty quickly the queenless unit raises its own new queen but it can take five or so weeks for the this queen to emerge and to have her own worker brood emerging. So you can speed that process up by simply queening the queenless part or by using a swarm or supersedure cell from another colony.\\nWe have always been impressed by Jim\u2019s story. He said all of that in just a few words over a cuppa one evening after a club meeting: \u2018I can\u2019t see the problem. I split my bees. I don\u2019t have swarming problems\u2019. That has not always been the case as we have all had to learn the hard way, but it does work for all us old timers.\\nDemaree Plan (next month)\\nWhen we finally caught up with Jim again, we drew admissions that he did few other necessary things. Like us he requeens regularly and does regular disease checks. In the sequel we will explore the widely misunderstood but very remarkable Demaree Plan. It was invented way back in the early 1890\u2019s. It is quite different to hive splitting and, as we shall see, requires no gear other than a single queen excluder and maybe an extra super. We will conclude our simple swarm control guide with a brief recommendation to requeen regularly, a great practice for not only reducing swarming incidence but for making you the owner of strong healthy bees.\\nDemuth, G.S.

{"id":841,"question":"I'm new to car mechanics and wondering - what's the main difference between how old-school fuel systems handled high-power engines versus today's smart fuel pumps?","gold":"The key difference lies in how fuel delivery is managed. Traditional systems used a constant-speed approach where fuel pumps ran at full capacity regardless of engine demands, requiring higher line pressure from pump to regulator than from regulator to carburetor to combat G-forces and push fuel through restrictive regulator valves. Modern smart fuel pumps utilize variable speed technology that adjusts fuel delivery based on actual engine needs. These new systems feature electronic control where pump speed is regulated according to power demands, reducing heat and preventing vapor lock when full power isn't needed. The newer systems are also more efficient - while traditional systems might struggle to maintain correct float bowl levels, modern variable speed pumps can fine-tune fuel delivery precisely when needed, improving average float level and fueling bowls more quickly and consistently. This advancement has enabled smaller, lighter pumps to fuel more horsepower while also operating more quietly and having longer service life.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:9bb2bed5-fabb-4af4-9667-fee70db09258>', '<urn:uuid:73845707-9e90-4ed6-bde8-7b8f01f512db>']","texts":"['Consider this \u2013 a high 10 second drag car will burn up one gallon of gasoline in 25 seconds or less, but a car that can run a 7 second E.T. will burn the same amount of fuel in half the time. The physics involved with fuel flow to create horsepower is difficult for even experts to understand, but one thing is for certain: if the fuel system is marginal, you won\u2019t be able to get the maximum out of the engine, which could lead to an unhappy customer who will take his engine elsewhere.\\nThere are many different components and configurations involved in a racing fuel system \u2013 a system largely made up of valves, pumps, diaphragms, seals and orifices. Therefore, several variables come into play when setting up a fuel system for a performance application. The main purpose of the fuel system is to pull fuel from the tank and deliver it to the carburetor or injectors with enough volume and pressure to overcome any forces (G-forces, weather, etc.) that may be working against the system.\\nBefore you choose a fuel system and its related pumps, regulators, etc., you will need to know what type of fuel your customer will use. If it\u2019s a different fuel than gasoline such as nitrous or alcohol, for instance, the engine you build will require more fuel (volume) than what you would normally burn for a gasoline engine, so you will likely need a modified system that can flow enough for the engine\u2019s needs.\\nTypically, at wide-open throttle (WOT) a gasoline engine will burn approximately .5 lb. of fuel per hour for every horsepower. So that means a 650 hp engine will burn 325 lbs. of fuel every hour. Selecting the proper fuel system components for your customer\u2019s performance application, whether it\u2019s for the street or the track or a combination of both, is as important as the internal components you select.\\nFuel systems vary depending on what type of induction system you use. If you are running electronic fuel injection (EFI), you will need a different system than you would if you\u2019re running a carbureted engine. In many forms of racing and on many street performance engines, carburetors are still king. And a high efficiency fuel pump that delivers volume and pressure with a dynamic, return-style regulator, designed for use with carburetors will often solve mysterious fuel problems.\\nOften times engine builders only see part of the fuel system such as the carburetor or injectors and the necessary plumbing to and from these components. If you have a stock or modified mechanical pump or belt driven pump, you may get to build a lot more of the system.\\nThere are many racing and performance fuel pumps on the market available from several manufacturers built to suit nearly every application. Knowing what to choose for your customer\u2019s engine can be a complicated decision, and you will need to ask many questions and talk to some manufacturers if you still aren\u2019t sure whether the pump is correct for the application.\\nJust because the engine runs without a miss or sputter, doesn\u2019t mean that the engine is getting enough fuel or that the system is optimized. After all, the more pounds of fuel an engine can burn efficiently, the more horsepower it will produce. In some racing applications such as certain stock cars classes, when a mechanical fuel pump is specified by the rules, a belt drive or hex drive fuel pump is recommended. These pumps offer higher fuel delivery volume for a mechanical pump while also maintaining lower fuel pressure at lower engine speeds.\\nFor drag racing applications, an electric fuel pump is often the best way to go. These pumps will help prevent fuel starvation or \u201claying down\u201d at mid-track. If your drag racing customer complains of this problem, the engine may be experiencing intermittent fuel starvation.\\nThe reason for this is because under hard acceleration the demand for fuel increases. But the quick acceleration (G-forces) can cause the float bowl levels to drop and lead to fuel starvation. In high gear, engine speed increases more slowly allowing the bowls to fill again.\\nFuel pump manufacturers, for the most part, rate their pumps based on calculating gallons-per-hour. And while this is an important factor that helps determine which fuel pump is the most suited for a particular engine combination, so too are things such as engine horsepower and fuel efficiency, commonly referred to as BSFC or Brake Specific Fuel Consumption; maximum fuel system pressure and the flow volume at that pressure; available voltage at the pump under load and the flow volume at that voltage. Different engine combinations, power adders, even fuel octane ratings and tuning approaches can have a significant impact on BSFC. You must consider these factors carefully when choosing a fuel pump.\\nNaturally aspirated engines are normally most efficient with a BSFC between .4 and .5 pounds of fuel per horsepower per hour (lbs\/hp\/hr). And engines enhanced by nitrous typically use a little extra fuel and often develop a BSFC from .5 to .6 lbs\/hp\/hr. Forced induction engines are usually least efficient and BSFC ranges from .6 to .75 lbs\/hp\/hr.\\nFuel pressure should normally be set between 6 and 8 psi for a gasoline carburetor. However, experts point out that fuel pressure is not a substitute for volume. If the fuel bowls are not full, the pressure in the system doesn\u2019t mean anything. In fact, experts say, fuel pressure is simply an indication of the amount of restriction in the fuel system.\\nMost electrical fuel pump systems require the use of at least one fuel pressure regulator. It is often recommended to use two regulators in high horsepower engines to avoid excessive fuel restriction and provide adequate volume.\\nIn some pumps, such as a mechanical fuel pump, a bypass is often preferred rather than a regulator. A diaphragm bypass without an idle bleed is recommended when constant fuel pressure is needed from an electrical or mechanical pump.\\nA belt driven fuel pump, using gasoline or alcohol, requires a diaphragm bypass with an idle bleed. Higher pressure mechanical fuel pumps delivering alcohol require a throttle bypass to supply the variable fuel pressure required by the carburetor.\\nUse of a filter is highly recommended as long as it doesn\u2019t restrict fuel flow. But you should always use a fuel filter that is specifically designed for racing. The latest technology in fuel filters allows more filtration as well as higher flow.\\nThe fuel filter should be installed in the line before the fuel pump. This prevents any debris from entering the fuel pump or the rest of the system, including inside the engine.\\nYou would never think of running a race engine without an oil filter, yet sometimes the fuel filter is not added or upgraded for performance applications.\\nSteady and significant improvements to cylinder heads, intake manifolds and carburetors and injectors have necessitated the need for more efficient fuel systems in order to get the maximum power out of the engine.\\nDetermining the fuel volume necessary for a particular engine is the first step in selecting a fuel pump. How does fuel pressure affect pump delivery? The effect of rising fuel pressure has significant impact on flow volume. By eliminating unnecessary fuel pressure rise, increases flow, maximizing the power potential of any fuel system.\\nAnother factor to consider in fuel pump performance is voltage supply as measured at the fuel pump terminals. Voltage to an electric motor is like fuel pressure to an injector: more pressure in equals more volume out. Higher voltage at the pump terminals increases motor torque, resulting in more rpm and an increased flow volume for a given pressure. To illustrate this, a fuel pump manufacturer tested one of its pumps at 80 psi and had a 40 percent increase in volume when the voltage was increased from 12v to 13.5v.\\nThe fuel system\u2019s first priority is to keep the floats from running low enough to uncover the main jet, running the engine out of fuel. It may not seem significant but the weight of fuel above the main jet does impact fuel flow through it, and therefore the air\/fuel ratio of the engine under load. Here the typical static fuel system struggles. The fuel is standing in the line, barely moving and to make matters worse, the static style regulator places the check valve between the fuel pump and carburetor, restricting fuel flow across the board.\\nTo combat this, fuel pressure in a static system should always be higher from the pump to the regulator than it is from the regulator to the carburetor. This higher line pressure is necessary for two reasons, one to start flow against G-forces and to push fuel through the restrictive regulator valve. The benefits of a dynamic, return style fuel system are many, including longer pump life, a noticeable increase in pump to horsepower ratings (allowing smaller, lighter pumps to fuel more hp), even quieter pump operation is common. Ultimately, combining the right pump and regulator into a dynamic fuel system significantly improves average float level, fueling the bowls more quickly and consistently.\\nTo produce torque and horsepower requires a mixture of air and fuel. As explained earlier, a 600 hp engine will require 300 lbs. of gasoline per hour and, by the same formula, an 800 hp engine needs 400 lbs. per hour. Also note that all the fuel has to be delivered past the needles and seats (or injectors in EFI) and the fuel pressure regulator.\\nSo what happens if fuel delivery is not optimized? That hot camshaft, carburetor, and flowed set of heads may have overstressed an already taxed fuel delivery system. Carburetors cannot disperse the optimum air\/fuel mixture unless the fuel system has the ability to maintain correct float bowl levels. Fuel levels that are too low may not cause the motor to miss or \u201cburn\u201d a piston, but they will reduce fuel flow and lower performance.\\nAs an engine builder, the fuel system may not be entirely your responsibility if you are supplying an engine with an external fuel pump. Most modern engines have electric fuel pumps mounted in the fuel tank. Many racing engines use an electric fuel pump mounted to a chassis rail. In many cases the fuel system, which, for the sake of this article, includes the fuel lines, regulator, fittings, pump, filter, rails, tank, etc. These parts of the fuel system must work together harmoniously to produce the right amount of fuel at the right time \u2013 like when the driver mashes the gas.\\nThe fuel system is your engine\u2019s lifeline and without an adequate supply of fuel, your engine will literally starve to death. Racing and high performance engine applications require special attention to the fuel system and may require upgrading to handle the needs of that application. If you\u2019re building any kind of modified engine, you will likely have to modify the fuel pump, plumbing and filters of the system to keep up with the demands of the engine. No matter if you run fuel injection or carburetor, a stock fuel system is not likely going to supply enough fuel when you need it (or when the driver needs it).\\nBG Fuel Systems\\nAeromotive Fuel Systems', 'Fuel On Demand: High Performance Variable Speed Fuel Pumps\\nInternal combustion engines require sufficient amounts of fuel to make power. This isn\u2019t just about making power, but preventing self-destruction because we don\u2019t have enough fuel in its important relationship with air. Nitrous, supercharging, and turbocharging create demand to where you must have enough fuel to air to prevent engine damage, yet not overwhelm the engine and lose power.\\nImagine a system where you can fine-tune fuel delivery to your engine\u2019s demands. Fuelab, Aeromotive, and Holley have precisely what the doctor ordered for your tough fuel system requirements. You may opt for a variable speed fuel pump system from Fuelab, go with a pressure-regulated conventional high-capacity pump system from Holley, or utilize an adjustable controller for your pump from Aeromotive. The choice is yours.\\nChoosing A System\\nBefore you can properly select a fuel pump, it\u2019s important to know what kind of power your engine is going to make plus how it will be used most of the time. \u201cIn the past, fuel pump manufacturers have rated their offerings based on gallons-per-hour, free-flow (no test pressure), and with no reference to test voltage,\u201d Jesse Powell of Aeromotive tells us. \u201cIn the real world, this gave no indication of the horsepower that could be supported by such a pump.\u201d This is why you need to know as much about your engine as is possible before choosing a pump system. We say \u201cpump system\u201d because fuel delivery happens via more elements than just a pump. There\u2019s high-pressure fuel line and a means of regulating fuel pressure. Most systems employ a pressure regulator, which controls return flow to the tank thereby controlling fuel pressure. The pressure regulator gets its vacuum signal from intake manifold vacuum, which is based on throttle position and load.\\nPowell tells us pump size is determined by how much horsepower your engine is expected to make and how much fuel will be required to support that power. You must also consider power adders like nitrous and supercharging in your plan. Aeromotive suggests estimating on the high side when it comes to horsepower to play it safe. Better too much fuel than too little. Too little means lean mixture, detonation, and great potential for engine failure.\\nIn the past, manufacturers have rated their offerings based on gallons-per-hour, free-flow with no reference to voltage. This gave no indication of the horsepower that could be supported. \u2013 Jesse Powell, Aeromotive\\nBSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) is crucial to fuel pump and injector selection \u2013 so get familiar with this term and what it means. BSFC boils down to how much fuel we\u2019re going to burn to make a given amount of horsepower. The higher the BSFC number, the more fuel we\u2019re going to have to have.\\nAeromotive adds that naturally aspirated engines are most efficient with a BSFC between .4 and .5 lbs\/hp\/hr.\\nNitrous combinations call for additional fuel and often develop a BSFC from .5 to .6 lbs\/hp\/hr. If you\u2019re going to supercharge or turbocharge, BSFC should range from .6 to .75 lbs\/hp\/hr. This means you need greater amounts of fuel to meet the demand.\\nSo what does all this complicated math mean for you?\\nHere are a couple of real world examples:\\nIf we have a 650 horsepower engine and multiply horsepower times .4 BSFC, we\u2019re going to burn 260 pounds of gasoline. If we have .75 BSFC, our 650-horse engine becomes very thirsty at 487 pounds of gasoline. This means .75 BSFC is grossly inefficient. Same horsepower, but with huge amounts of fuel consumption. This means you must carefully choose the right pump system for your engine\u2019s demands.\\nAvoiding Engine Armageddon\\nHow Do I Know How Much Pump I Need?\\n- Engine Flywheel Horsepower\\n- Engine fuel efficiency, commonly referred to as BSFC or Brake Specific Fuel Consumption\\n- Maximum fuel system pressure and the pump\u2019s flow volume at that pressure\\n- Available voltage at the fuel pump under engine load and the pump\u2019s flow volume at that voltage\\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019re going to need to know about choosing injector size: Take the known amount of gasoline required in pounds and divide by the number of injectors you\u2019re going to need. Again, err to the side of caution. Too much is better than too little. Aeromotive suggests the following formula: take 650 horsepower and multiply by .4 BSFC to get 260 pounds of fuel. Then, take 260 pounds of petrol and divide by eight injectors to get 32.5 lbs\/hr or 33 lb\/hr injectors. When we take that 33 lb\/hr figure and crank in caution with 33 divided by .8, we get 41 lb\/hr at an 80-percent duty cycle. And because you care about your engine, it\u2019s a good idea to check these numbers with a seasoned engine builder before buying fuel system components.\\nFuelab\u2019s On-Demand Fuel Delivery System\\nFuelab is a forward thinking company with digital electric fuel pumps. Your first thoughts are likely how does anyone digitize an electric fuel pump? Fuelab does this via electronic control where fuel pump speed is regulated based on engine power demands.\\nWe decided to introduce new brushless pump motor technology into fuel pump design and manufacturing. \u2013 Brian Paitz, Fuelab\\n\u201cWe decided to introduce new brushless pump motor technology into fuel pump design and manufacturing,\u201d Brian Paitz of Fuelab tells us.\\nFuelab claims that brushless technology enables them to make a lighter pump that offers a quicker response to changing power demands. What\u2019s more, you can run just about anything through the Fuelab pump \u2014 gasoline, methanol, E85, or diesel. And, you can change fuel type at any time.\\n\u201cOne problem with a high-performance electric pump like this is heat,\u201d Paitz comments. \u201cThese pumps require a lot of electric current, which makes heat; and heat causes unwanted vapor lock.\u201d Vapor lock causes fuel stagnation shutting an engine down in short order,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo prevent vapor lock, Fuelab has developed an electronic fuel pressure regulator that reduces heat when a vehicle is on the street.\u201d This process reduces pump speed generating less heat. The pump runs at a conservative speed on the street where large quantities of fuel are not needed. When it\u2019s time to lock and load, the Fuelab system kicks into high gear providing plenty of fuel to meet the increased demand. Speed control is based on feedback from the pressure regulator. \u201cIt is the first true on-demand type of fuel system,\u201d Paitz adds.\\n- 40401 Reduced Size EFI In-Line Fuel Pump 75 GPH @ 45 PSI \u2013 rated up to 700 hp\\n- 40402 Reduced Size Carbureted In-Line Fuel Pump 160 GPH @ 15 PSI \u2013 Rated up to 800 hp\\n- 41401 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Pressure EFI In Line 105 GPH @ 45 PSI \u2013 rated up to 1000 hp\\n- 41402 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Efficiency EFI In Line 140 GPH @ 45 PSI \u2013 rated up to 1300 hp\\n- 41403 Prodigy Fuel Pump Carbureted In Line 200 GPH @ 20 PSI \u2013 rated up to 1800 hp\\n- 41404 Prodigy Fuel Pump Carbureted In Line 200 GPH @ 20 PSI \u2013 rated up to 1800 hp\\n- 42401 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Pressure EFI In Line 170 GPH @ 45 PSI \u2013 rated up to 1500 hp\\n- 42402 Prodigy Fuel Pump High Power EFI In-Line 190 GPH @ 45 PSI \u2013 rated up to 1800 hp\\nFew companies are more on top of the fuel game than Holley. Known for legendary carburetors so loved by racers worldwide, it\u2019s no surprise that our friends at Holley have come up with a high-performance fuel delivery system for fuel injected and carbureted systems alike. The in-line Holley HP billet fuel pump is just what the doctor ordered for carbureted and fuel injected vehicles alike. Liz Miles, respected automotive journalist and Holley representative, told us, \u201cThe HP line of billet electric fuel pumps feature Gerotor technology for positive displacement providing reliable fuel delivery on the street or on the track.\u201d She adds the HP pump can deliver for 100,000 miles from a good-looking, cost effective package. It can take up to 18.5 volts and deliver up to 80 psi.\\nIf you\u2019re going to huff serious horsepower, Holley\u2019s patented twin-pump Dominator is for you. The Dominator, as its name implies, is excellent for nitrous, supercharging, or turbocharging. This guy is machined from solid billet for fierce durability. It\u2019s also fully submersible for in-tank use or you can mount it on the chassis for in-line use. This pump can be triggered from a myriad of sources to bring that additional fuel on demand that your engine requires at wide open throttle.\\nHolley Pump Facts\\n- HP In-Line Pump 12-700 Up to 700 horsepower EFI or 900 with a carburetor\\n- HP In-Line Pump 12-890 Up to 900 horsepower EFI or 1050 with a carburetor. Hi-Flow Pump\\n- Dominator Pump 12-1400 Up to 1400 horsepower EFI or 1830 with a carburetor\\n- Dominator Pump 12-1800 Up to 1800 horsepower EFI or 2100 with a carburetor\\nAeromotive\u2019s Fuel Pump Controller\\nWhat if you\u2019d like to continue using the fuel pump that you already own, but want the benefits that a variable speed pump offers? That\u2019s exactly the option that Aeromotive brought to the table with the creation of their Billet Fuel Pump Speed Controller. The device, when used on any pump on any type of vehicle, reduces fuel heating and vapor-lock issues by matching the duty cycle of the fuel pump to the engine RPM. When at low demand, the controller slows down the speed of the fuel pump to reduce suction side cavitation and vapor lock. As demand increases, the controller then returns the pump to 100% duty cycle to achieve maximum flow.\\nThe Billet Fuel Pump Speed Controller operates by emitting a pulse modulation signal to the pump motor to reduce or increase the pump speed. Such an operation, that doesn\u2019t alter\/reduce voltage, is virtually harmless to the pump motor.\\nThe Billet Fuel Pump Speed Controller features LED indicators to confirm ignition signal hookup and verifies action of the manual override circuit, as well as when the circuit is providing full voltage to the pump. Other features include a billet 6061-T651 aircraft aluminum housing with a black anodized finish, a solid-state transistor circuit rated at 40 amps, and an adjustable, full-speed RPM threshold.\\nThe Fuel Pump Future is in your hands\\nRegardless of which of these routes you opt to take for your fuel system needs, the benefits of a variable speed fuel system are aplenty, and there\u2019s no question that your engine will benefit in the long-term from variable speed operation. Just when you thought selecting the proper pump for you needs was a tricky element, modern technology went and dropped another decision into your lap, but technology\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"distant-from-document","answer_type_category":"temporal-evolution","error":null,"n":2}

These typically trade on separate futures exchanges, which allow for higher volumes of trading.\\nRecommended: A Guide to Derivatives Trading\\nWhat Is a Futures Contract?\\nFutures contracts, or futures, are legal agreements to either buy or sell a given security, commodity, or asset at a specific time in the future, for a previously agreed-upon price. For investors, they offer access to commodities and other markets they might not be able to access otherwise. They can also act as a way to protect against volatility.\\nOne important feature of a future contract is that both buyers and sellers can execute the contract regardless of the current market price of the underlying asset when the contract expires.\\nInvestors use futures contracts when they believe that the underlying security will go up or down by a certain amount of time over a fixed period of time. The futures contract buyer enters a legal agreement to buy the underlying asset at the contract\u2019s expiration date. On the other side of the trade, the futures contract seller agrees to deliver the underlying security at the agreed-upon price, when the contract expires.\\nThe majority of futures contracts on a futures exchange are standardized by date and price, to allow for higher trading volumes and simpler transactions.\\nInvestors can buy futures contracts to make money \u2013 or to hedge against losses \u2013 resulting from the price increases or decreases in stocks and commodities like oil, as well as other financial instruments.\\nRecommended: Perpetual Futures and Swaps in Crypto & Investing\\nHow Do Futures Contracts Work?\\nIn a futures contract, the purchaser gets to buy a given asset at a predetermined price. That can help protect against big price swings up or down, making them popular not only with investors, but with companies that rely on commodities that experience sudden price changes.\\nExample of a Futures Contract\\nAn airline, for example, might buy an oil futures contract to lock in the price of the oil that it will need to buy in order to get its jets off the ground in the coming months. Purchasing the futures contract allows the airline to guard against the financial harm of a sudden rise in the price of fuel. The risk to the airline, however, is that oil prices will go down \u2013 in which case, it will miss out on those lower prices.\\nOn the other side of this hypothetical transaction is a fuel distributor, which has millions of gallons of oil in its inventory. It would sell the oil futures contract as a way of maintaining a steady market for its oil in the coming months. That\u2019s because the airline buying the futures contract must buy the fuel at the agreed-upon price on the dates specified in the contract. That removes some risk for the oil distributor, but it also creates a risk if oil prices climb before the futures contract expires. Should that happen, the oil distributor will still have to sell the oil at the lower price specified in the futures contract.\\nTo stay with this example, in the futures contract, the airline and the oil distributor will set and agree upon the terms, specifically the price of the oil and the expiration date upon which the contract expires. In this contract, the distributor agrees to sell 1,000 barrels of oil at $50 per barrel, in exactly 90 days. If the price of oil in 90 days is $75 per barrel, then the airline will have gotten a good deal. If a barrel of oil falls to $35, then the oil supplier will have protected itself against the price declines.\\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Futures and Options?\\nFutures and options are both derivative contracts. However, futures contracts oblige the buyer or seller to complete the deal at the contract\u2019s expiration, while options contracts give traders the right but not always the obligation to execute the contract when it expires.\\nRecommended: 10 Important Options Trading Strategies\\nBoth futures and options share some of the same trading terminology. For example, both investors in both types of derivatives will need to consider it\u2019s bid-ask price. The bid price is the highest price a buyer will pay for the contract, while the ask price is what the seller will accept.\\nInvestors can also purchase options on future contracts. In a call option on a future, the buyer has the right to buy a futures contract at a specific price at a specific future date. In a put option, the buyer has the right to sell the futures contract at a specific price at a specific date.\\nRecommended: Call vs Put Options: What\u2019s the Difference?\\nFutures Contracts Pros & Cons\\nFutures trading can be a profitable strategy, but it also has some drawbacks that investors should consider.\\nBenefits of Futures Contracts\\n\u2022 Futures contracts act as a hedge against the risks related to price volatility.\\n\u2022 Most futures markets are highly liquid, allowing traders to buy and sell when they want.\\n\u2022 Futures may give investors access to commodities, and other markets not normally accessible to everyday investors.\\n\u2022 Futures contract pricing is determined by adding the cost of carrying the underlying asset to its spot price.\\nDownsides of Futures Contracts\\n\u2022 Futures contracts can be a high risk investment. In some cases, a futures contract can lose all of its value and trade at $0 when it expires.\\n\u2022 Futures contracts can reduce or eliminate potential gains from price swings in the underlying securities or assets.\\n\u2022 Futures contracts themselves are often highly volatile, with their prices fluctuating wildly.\\n\u2022 You may have to pay high commission charges on high-volume trades.\\nHow Investors Use Futures Contracts\\nBut not everyone who buys an oil futures contract plans to take delivery of the oil it represents. Retail investors also use futures as a way to protect their investments against volatility. Those futures investors who buy and sell the contracts to make money off the price changes that the contracts themselves undergo.\\nTo go back to the example of an oil futures contract, an investor owns a contract, and the price of oil rises, allowing the contract owner to buy oil for less than the market price. The investor will be able to sell that contract for more than they purchased it for. The investor will then sell the contract on the futures market.\\nOther investors use futures contracts related to other commodities, including corn, soybeans and wheat. But there are also futures markets where investors can buy futures contracts that offer them the ability to bet on the future of currencies, individual stocks or stock indices like the S&P 500 or 10-year Treasury bills. Investors may choose to buy futures, rather than the securities themselves, to reduce their volatility exposure.\\nHow to Trade Futures Contracts\\nThere are several steps to trading futures contracts.\\n1. Open a brokerage account\\nTo trade futures contracts, the first thing you\u2019ll need is a brokerage account. You may also need your broker to give approval for margin and options privileges in your account.\\n2. Set a trading strategy\\nBefore jumping into the futures market, develop a strategy. That strategy could involve technical analysis based on market data, or fundamental analysis based on the investment\u2019s underlying economic and financial trends.\\nSome investors even try out their strategy using hypothetical trades before they start trading with real money. This allows you to understand the risks of potential trades without actually losing money.\\n3. Research trades that make sense for your investment strategy\\nMost brokerages that offer futures trading have an online platform you can use to research specific securities and see futures contracts available to buy or sell.\\n4. Double-check the terms\\nMake sure that the contracts will do what you think. That means confirming the selling and purchase price of the contract, the expiration, and the fees.\\n5. Develop your skills\\nWhether doing it on paper, or with real money, you\u2019ll want to refine your strategy over time. You may find that you make more profitable trades in a specific sector, for example, or need to work on staying calm as security prices rise and fall. Practice will allow you to improve, and get more out of the futures strategy you\u2019ve developed.\\nFutures contracts are a type of investment that can offer access to commodities markets, as well as a way to protect against volatility. They can be a helpful tool to some investors, but they\u2019re also risky and can be an expensive way to invest.\\nWhile SoFi does not offer futures contracts, it does provide a great way for investors to get started building a portfolio.

Once the realm of institutional investors, like large banks, funds, and brokerages, the financial landscape is now experiencing a surge in participation from retail investors. These everyday individuals increasingly take charge of their financial destinies through digital platforms, reshaping the traditional dynamics of investment and trading.\\nMetaTrader 4: The Gateway to Online Trading\\nSource: Financial Times Equity Indices November 2023\\nThe widespread adoption of platforms such as MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is at the heart of this revolution. Esteemed by both novice and seasoned traders, MT4 has revolutionized how individuals engage with the financial markets. Its user-friendly interface and robust analytical tools simplify the trading process. The platform supports live and demo accounts, offering a practical learning environment for beginners and a sophisticated platform for experienced traders.\\nAn integral part of the online trading universe is the forex market. With a staggering daily volume, forex trading involves 39 different currencies. As of 2022, the daily volume for the USD alone was nearly six billion U.S. dollars, significantly higher than that of the Euro. The forex market operates on the fluctuations of currency interest rates, offering opportunities to profit from the varying performance of currencies like the U.S. dollar against others. This market, not frequently measured, only releases turnover figures once every three years, highlighting the USD\u2019s dominance in global currency trading.\\nThe Impact of Retail Trading\\nThe transformative power of retail trading was strikingly evident in the Gamestop and AMC Entertainment events of 2021. These episodes, driven by retail investors coordinating through online trading apps and social media, led to a substantial increase in the stock prices of these companies. This movement not only disrupted established market trends but also showcased the collective influence of individual investors.\\nThe global online trading market is on an upward trajectory. According to Statista, the market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.4%, potentially reaching around $13.3 billion by 2026. This growth is fueled by rising interest among millennials and increased platform users, with brokers like Robinhood leading the charge. Factors such as a low-cost business model, technological integration, and effective use of social media have been instrumental in this expansion.\\nKey Aspects of Modern Trading Platforms\\n- Security: Security is a top priority for high-quality trading platforms, particularly for traders investing substantial funds. These platforms are typically regulated and licensed, providing a secure environment to protect traders\u2019 investments.\\n- Functionality and Available Features: Modern platforms offer swift order execution and a variety of trading tools, essential for fast-moving markets like Forex. They also enable traders to experiment with new strategies in simulated environments before applying them with real funds.\\n- Reliability: Reliability is crucial, especially for platforms used by aggressive traders who make frequent, large trades. The best platforms ensure stable performance, even during high market volatility or global economic events.\\n- User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface is key, allowing for easy order placement and effective trade management. These platforms feature one-click trading and straightforward navigation, making them accessible to traders of all experience levels.\\n- Average Trading Costs: While trading involves some costs, effective platforms offer a balance between fees and the quality of the trading experience. It\u2019s important to choose a platform with transparent and reasonable costs.\\n- Automatic Trading: Not all platforms provide automated trading options, but those can enhance the trading experience with algorithmic suggestions or custom automated trading conditions. However, these features should be carefully evaluated to ensure profitability.\\nWhat Fuels the Online Trading Phenomenon?\\nThe advancement of technology has been a pivotal factor in the growth of online trading. It has made investing more accessible, efficient, and economical. Platforms now offer real-time data, comprehensive industry reports, and instant trading notifications, making them a compelling alternative to traditional brokerages. For instance, in 2021, Interactive Brokers reported an average of 3,905 trades per day, significantly higher than previous years, underscoring the increasing activity in online trading.\\nAs of 2023, about 61% of adults in the United States are engaged in the stock market, with many opting for neo-brokers to facilitate their trading activities. Despite the enduring appeal of traditional investment options like bonds, real estate, and gold, the stock market continues to attract diverse investors. This reflects a broader shift in investment strategies, where people seek security and growth opportunities in the dynamic realm of stocks.\\nA New Era of Financial Participation\\nThe landscape of finance is witnessing a significant transformation. Retail trading, powered by platforms like MetaTrader 4 and buoyed by technological advancements, represents a new era in the financial world. It\u2019s not merely a passing trend but a fundamental shift in how individuals interact with the markets. As people gain greater access and control over their investments, the barriers that once defined the financial markets disappear, leading to a more inclusive and democratized financial ecosystem.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"problem-solution","error":null,"n":2}

What are the advantages of projectors for large screen displays?","gold":"Installation projectors offer significant advantages for large screen visualization compared to other technologies like LFDs (Large Format Displays) or LED displays. The main benefit is that projectors provide the lowest cost per square meter for large screen visualization, with both lower initial and operational costs. Additionally, with the development of laser technology, projectors now offer long-lasting and reliable performance along with higher brightness levels and huge visual surfaces, making them particularly suitable for large venue applications.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:c1a5ecc9-a2e7-464a-8447-ef80ba0bdb4d>']","texts":"['In terms of innovation in projection, the biggest strides taken in recent years have been the move to 4K resolution and the proliferation of laser illumination. Now that all the major players offer both of these, one could argue that there is very little separating the leading manufacturers\u2019 product sets.\\nAdditionally, despite the relative commoditisation of the market, there have been few new entrants, aside from a number of brands from China that have been unable to establish themselves in EMEA. In a market such as this, with a dearth of new companies shaking up the established order, innovation or evolution from within becomes even more important.\\nThis uncertainty sits against a backdrop of some fairly dire predictions about what the projection market will look like in the next few years. How does the current health of the market stack up against these predictions and what are the next steps?\\n\u201cFor years there have been people professing that projection will be killed, and for years the market has proven this to not be the case,\u201d says Joe Ahmed, Optoma head of marketing, EMEA.\\nAnd in terms of how the projection market has evolved in recent years, Ahmed continues: \u201cThere are some interesting shifts in the adoption of projection technology. The market has primarily changed due to technology disruptors (both internal and external of projection) both limiting projection and creating new opportunities for projection.\u201d\\nThomas Walter, section manager strategic product marketing at NEC Display Solutions Europe, comments: \u201cThe demand for installation projectors is growing continuously and significantly. There are two major reasons for this \u2013 the development of laser as a superior light technology with long-lasting and reliable performance and the general need for higher brightness levels and huge visual surfaces.\\n\u201cInstallation projectors, compared to other visual technologies such as LFDs or LED, are still providing the lowest cost per square metre when it comes to large screen visualisation and come at the lowest initial and operational cost. Laser light sources extend the lifetime compared to traditional UHP lamps tremendously, allowing more reliable and maintenance-friendly operation.\u201d\\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t all about a race to the highest resolution and brightness\u201d\\nNick Loftus, business development executive at Acer, states: \u201cBesides the technology moving forward, the projector market has become more user-centric recently.\u201d\\nBack to Ahmed, who says projection mapping software has opened up more sectors and possible applications: \u201cCoupled with laser technology, this has allowed projection to be used in many new sectors and environments that previously were not viable, most notably digital signage for retail and leisure and hospitality. This has transformed projection to be an engaging and immersive experience which captures audience imaginations and plays into the augmented reality trend.\u201d\\nWhile the death of projection may have been exaggerated, the fact remains that it is a crowded market that has been short of disruptive innovation. Therefore, what can manufacturers do to stand out?\\n\u201cIncreased resolution is one area that manufacturers can differentiate,\u201d states Chris Axford, international sales and marketing director at Digital Projection, which introduced the world\u2019s first 8K DLP laser projector at ISE this year. \u201cHowever, it isn\u2019t all about a race to the highest resolution and brightness. There are other key features that customers are asking for, such as ultra-high frame rates at native resolution.\\n\u201cAside from the technical specifications, customers also demand the best service and support, both pre and post sales. This is an area we have also been pioneering for years, and continue to take seriously by respecting the raison d\u2019\u00eatre and importance of all stakeholders in the channel, while proactively working with all our partners to ensure that they receive all the support they need on their often mission critical installations.\u201d\\nWalter also thinks that a consultative, customer-focused approach is desirable. For a company like NEC that offers the majority of the visualisation options, it is less about projection maintaining market share but finding the right solution for the particular situation. \u201cWhen it comes to large screen visualisation, different technologies such as LFDs, direct view LED and projection are all valid options with pros and cons which need to be considered according to the individual needs of the end user. The environmental situation regarding light, space, installation restrictions and the target outcomes of the visualisation all need to be considered. Since NEC uniquely supplies all three technologies, we put our customer\u2019s needs first, recommending the perfect-fit technology.\\n\u201cNEC successfully drives laser as a light source technology and just recently added RB laser as a light source to its portfolio. It combines the advantages of traditional technologies (laser phosphor and RGB laser) delivering image excellence with a low total cost of ownership.\u201d\\nAhmed adds: \u201cProjector brands have begun to focus more and more on specific vertical markets to ensure a successful value proposition. Optoma has had great success in developing the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors through the promotion of both its DuraCore and Multi Colour Laser technology, in addition to recruiting new innovative partners who share the same drive and vision of how the projection market will change.\u201d']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"with-premise","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"open-ended","error":null,"n":1}
{"id":782,"question":"why is rna itself a problem for mrna vaccines","gold":"RNA is problematic for mRNA vaccines because it is naturally immunogenic. The body has RNA sensors as part of viral recognition pathways that detect and react to circulating RNAs. This triggers inflammation and RNA degradation, while also slowing down translation and mRNA replication. To overcome this, researchers have developed special delivery systems like nanoparticles and chemical modifications that make the RNA 'invisible' to innate immunity receptors, allowing for optimal translation in target cells.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:fff90af7-b1d6-4673-8c42-4b9192a20b98>']","texts":"[\"As efforts to develop vaccines against the Zika virus (ZIKV) continue apace, Drew Weissman and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania reported an mRNA vaccine that induced long-term protection against the virus in mice and macaques after a single immunization. The vaccine, based on nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a ZIKV glycoprotein (preM-E) enveloped in lipid nanoparticles, induced antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies and primed T cell immunity, effectively generating a memory immune response that protected against infection with the virus (Figure 1).\\nFigure 1. Plasma viral loads of rhesus macaques challenged with ZIKV 5 weeks after a single immunization of nucleoside-modified ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNPs compared with unimmunized controls. Reproduced from Figure 4 of Pardi, N. et al. Nature (2017); SpringerNature.\\nmRNA vaccines work differently from classical vaccines. Typical vaccination strategies involve the administration of microbial antigens in the context of immune activation signals (adjuvants). These antigens are engulfed and processed by antigen-presenting cells, and presented to T and B cells to trigger antigen-specific immunity (for example, through antibody production, differentiation of memory T cells or expansion of cytotoxic T cells). Despite being efficacious and having good safety profiles in providing protection against many infectious agents, several infections (e.g. HIV) have proved difficult to tackle by vaccines, raising the need for more efficient immunization methods.\\nIn the search for new ways to generate immunity to infectious pathogens, nucleic acid vaccines based on RNA or DNA formulations have emerged as a new class of immunization therapies (a DNA vaccine that induced protection against ZIKV in mice was reported last year). Instead of an injection of antigens, mRNA vaccines are based on the delivery of mRNA molecules encoding a peptide antigen of interest (such as a membrane protein of a pathogen; Figure 2) to antigen-presenting cells to induce in situ expression of the antigen. Once inside the cell, the mRNA strand is translated, and the antigen is expressed and presented on major histocompatibility complexes at the cellular membrane to activate antigen-specific T and B cells. This strategy increases the availability of the antigen in antigen-presenting cells while bypassing the systemic activation of the immune system with strong antigens, which can have adverse effects.\\nFigure 2. Scheme of the nucleoside-modified mRNA including a signal peptide (SP) for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II and prM and E glycoproteins from ZIKV H\/PF\/2013. Reproduced from Extended Data Figure 1 of Pardi, N. et al. Nature (2017); SpringerNature.\\nOne downside of mRNA vaccines (and indeed of all mRNA-based therapies) is the fact that RNA itself is immunogenic. RNA sensors, part of natural viral recognition pathways, detect and react to circulating RNAs by inducing inflammation and RNA degradation, while simultaneously slowing down translation and mRNA replication. For this reason, one of the main research avenues in RNA therapeutics has been the engineering of efficient delivery systems and molecular strategies to mask RNA from host RNA receptors. In this context, nanoparticles that ensure intracellular delivery of mRNA are a crucial tool for potential mRNA vaccines; similarly, chemical modifications that render RNA \u2018invisible\u2019 to innate immunity receptors, such as nucleoside modifications, have enabled the \u2018silent\u2019 delivery of coding mRNA molecules to target cells for optimal translation.\\nThe usefulness of mRNA vaccines is not limited to infectious diseases; for example, this strategy has been used to induce immune responses to cancer-specific antigens or neoantigens.\\nPardi, N. et al.

Aqua is designed to observe Earth\u2019s water cycle: the oceans, evaporation, clouds, precipitation, snow cover, and, obviously, sea ice. It takes a vast amount of energy to move water from the ocean into the atmosphere and then move it around the planet, energy which comes from sunlight and steered by the Earth\u2019s spin. Observations like those of Aqua show us how the constituents of the atmosphere change how that transport occurs, how that energy is stored, and how we humans affect that with our grand experiment of adding carbon dioxide to the air. That also affects our environment, how plants and animals eat, drink, live, and die.\\nWe are animals, too, and we live in this environment created by sunlight, air, water, ice, and our own actions.\\nI am awed and moved when I see images like the one above.

A crack appeared several years ago, and on July 16th conditions were right to allow a new chunk to break free:\\nNote the scale: the width of that glacier at that point is 20 kilometers, or 12 miles.\\nThis iceberg was imaged by NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite, designed to monitor Earth\u2019s oceans. The berg itself is about half the size of the last one, but don\u2019t kid yourself: that\u2019s still huge.\\nAs before, we can speculate whether this is due to global warming or not. Icebergs calf all the time. However, note that the last time, the berg calved later in the summer (August), and this crack is much farther up the glacier than usually seen.\\nAs climate scientist Michael Mann says, global warming is like loaded dice. You don\u2019t know if any particular throw of snake eyes is due to them being fixed, but you\u2019ll see a lot more rolls turn up snake eyes than you would otherwise. Global warming is predicted to give us longer, hotter summers, drier conditions across the US, more record temperatures, thinner arctic ice, and having it cover less surface area of the Earth. And, yes, more frequent glacier calving.\\nBy the way, the 2010 calving event was the largest seen in nearly 50 years. And also by the way, June 2012 was one of the hottest since records have been kept. And also also by the way June 2012 had the highest land and ocean average surface temperatures in the northern hemisphere in recorded history. And oh, one more thing: it also was the 328th consecutive month with a global temperature higher than the 20th century average. You can read all about this in the NOAA report \"State of the Climate Global Analysis\" for June 2012.\\nBut you global warming deniers, you just go ahead and keep on denying. Keep cherry picking, keep changing the subject, keep misinterpreting graphs, and keep slinging ad hominems (note: that last one is skeevy and foul and disgusting almost beyond belief).\\nIn the meantime those of us who understand the actual situation will take it seriously, and continue to speak out. Because this we know:\\nThe Earth is warming up. The rate of warming has increased in the past century or so. This corresponds to the time of the Industrial Revolution, when we started dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases warm the planet (hence the name) \u2014 if they didn\u2019t we\u2019d have an average temperature below the freezing point of water. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is dumped into the atmosphere by humans to the tune of 30 billion tons per year, 100 times the amount from volcanoes. And finally, approximately 97% of climatologists who actually study climate agree that global warming is real, and caused by humans.\\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen, using data from the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE).\\n[The Desktop Project is my way of forcing myself to clean off my computer\\'s desktop by systematically writing a blog post for every cool picture I\\'ve been collecting and neglecting. I\\'ve been posting them every day for two weeks now. And there\\'s more to come!]\\nRegular readers know I\u2019m fascinated by clouds. The shapes they take on and the processes that form them are really interesting, especially when more unusual and rare conditions produce spectacularly odd clouds.\\nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of \"cloud streets\", technically called horizontal convective rolls. I hadn\u2019t either until recently, but they are amazingly cool-looking, especially when seen from space. Proof: check out this shot from March 2012 of cloud streets over Greenland taken by NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite:\\n[Click to ennebulenate, or grab an even higher-res version.]\\nIsn\u2019t that incredible? The formation mechanism for these clouds isn\u2019t well understood, but it involves gently rising warm, moist air getting blown to the side by a shear wind. This starts up a rotation in the clouds and stretches them out into these fantastically long parallel strips. Each row you see is spinning along the long axis, and each one is spinning in the opposite direction of the one next to it (this diagram may help).\\nTo give you a sense of scale, this image is over 2000 km (1200 miles) across! So these clouds can stretch a long, long way.\\nYou probably see clouds every day, or certainly quite often. Yet there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about them, and certainly many kinds I bet you\u2019ve never even heard of. What else is there you might be missing that\u2019s sitting in plain sight?\\nImage credit: Jeff Schmaltz\/MODIS Land Rapid Response Team, NASA GSFC\\nIn case you were wondering what the snow was like here in Colorado the other day\u2026\\n[Click to ensnowflakenate.]\\nThat\u2019s an image taken by NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite on February 5, 2012. I live in Boulder, to the northwest of Denver (which is labeled), right on the edge of the Rockies. We got well over 30 cm here locally, and it was deeper in other places. Typical of the area, though, the Sun was out the next day, and now our yard looks like a fairyland of sparkles.\\nIt\u2019s unusual to get a heavy snowfall like this in February (we do get big ones, but later in the year) and from what I\u2019ve heard this was a record for a February. And not to overextend the post to climate change, but a) weather is not climate\u2026 unless you add time, and 2) contrary to any soundbite you might hear, snowstorms will actually become more common as the Earth warms. Warmer weather means more evaporation, so more moisture in the air. It\u2019s still cold higher up in the atmosphere, and it\u2019s still cold in the winter over land, so a warmer planet overall means more snow in some places. I\u2019m not attributing this event to global warming, to be clear. But it\u2019s the kind of thing we can expect in the coming years.\\nNASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz, LANCE\/EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team at NASA GSFC\\nThis is truly amazing: you may remember that last August, a vast iceberg 25 km long calved off the Petermann glacier. This chunk of ice broke free and has made its way off Labrador and is headed to the north Atlantic.\\nNASA\u2019s Aqua satellite caught it in the open water:\\nIt looks almost serene and tiny, doesn\u2019t it? Yeah, until you grasp the scale of this picture: from left to right it\u2019s well over 400 km (320 miles) across, and that ice floe is still something like 20 km (12 miles) across, having shrunk a bit on its 3000 km journey. A beacon was placed on it last year and you can track its position online. Some fisherman shot some close-up video of the berg, too.\\nIt\u2019s unclear what will happen with this monster icecube. It may present a shipping danger, or even be trouble for offshore oil rigs in the Newfoundland area. Between the radio beacon and satellite images like this, hopefully its position and movement will be tracked well enough to predict where it\u2019s headed and minimize any trouble it might cause.\\nImage credit: Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Rapid Response Team at NASA GSFC\\n- Enormous glacier calves in largest arctic event seen in 48 years\\n- Dramatic glacial retreat caught by NASA satellite\\n- Subterranean glaciers on Mars\\n- The Amazing Cruise: Day 3 (pix of a glacier I took in Alaska)\\nThe other day I posted a video showing GOES space imagery of the severe storms that blasted across the United States on April 27.

The antibody, produced from a single cell line, is called the monoclonal antibody (McAb). The first generation of monoclonal antibodies came from hybridoma antibody technology developed by Koehler and Milstein in 1975. On the basis of cell fusion technology, mouse B cells capable of secreting specific antibodies and mouse myeloma cells with unlimited reproductive ability were fused into B cell hybridoma. A specific antibody against an antigenic epitope can be prepared by culturing a group of cells with a single hybridoma cell with this property, as shown in figure 1. However, the human immune system can recognize mouse monoclonal antibodies, which can cause human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. This not only shortens the half-life and weakens the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also sometimes causes serious adverse reactions, so the clinical application of the first generation of monoclonal antibodies is greatly limited.\\nFigure 1. Illustration showing the production route of hybridoma technology.\\nSince the advent of the first mouse monoclonal antibody Muromonab OKT3 in the world in 1986, nearly 80 monoclonal antibodies have been on the market in the world. So far, the monoclonal antibody has developed to the fourth generation: the first generation is mouse monoclonal antibody (momab), the second generation is human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (ximab), the third generation is humanized monoclonal antibody (zumab), the fourth generation is fully human monoclonal antibody (mumab). The advantage of humanized monoclonal antibody and human monoclonal antibody is that it can overcome the reaction of human anti-mouse antibody, prevent the monoclonal antibody molecule from being quickly eliminated by the immune system as heterogenous protein, and improve the biological activity of monoclonal antibody molecule. In particular, the variable and constant regions of human antibodies are human, which can further remove immunogenicity and side effects on the basis of humanized antibodies. Humanized antibodies and human antibodies have the characteristics of high affinity, high specificity and low toxicity and side effects, which greatly overcome the shortcomings of mouse antibodies and chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, it has become the inevitable trend of the development of therapeutic antibody drugs.\\nMonoclonal antibodies usually target disease-related antigens or specific receptors on the cell surface, such as the PD-1 receptor on the surface of tumor cells and the PD-L1 ligand on the surface of T cells. PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitors, which are in the limelight, belong to monoclonal antibodies and are the focus of tumor immunotherapy in recent years. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which are on the market, are PD-1 inhibitors and are mainly used in the treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. PD-L1 inhibitors atezolizumab (trade name Tecentriq), durvalumab (trade name Imfinzi) and avelumab (trade name Bavencio) have been approved for the treatment of urethral epithelial cancer. On September 28, 2018, FDA approved the listing of Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) jointly developed by Sanofi (Sanofi) and Regenerative. It is used to treat metastatic skin squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC patients who cannot receive healing surgery or radiotherapy. This is also the third anti-PD-1 antibody approved by FDA.\\nFigure 2. Mechanism of PD-1 receptor and PD-L1\/L2 inhibitors mediated cancer immunotherapy.\\nUp to now, monoclonal antibody drugs have become an important part of biomedicine and have broad application prospects in medical treatment. It has been successfully used in the treatment of tumors, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, transplantation rejection and other diseases. However, there are many bottlenecks in the preparation of monoclonal antibodies. At present, the bottleneck of antibody drug research and development lies in the screening of target molecules, humanization of antibodies and preparation of human antibodies, high-throughput and large-scale screening of antibodies, prediction, modeling and analysis of antigenic epitopes, construction of three-dimensional configuration of antigen-antibody interaction and various techniques to increase the function of antibody effect.\\n1.Target Screening of Antibody Drug\\nTraditional antibody drugs are developed at the level of a single gene, a single protein, and a single antibody. First of all, it will take many years to study the function of the gene and its coding protein to confirm whether the gene and its encoded protein can be used as antibody drug targets to develop antibody drugs. The main drawback of this method is that the number of antibody drug targets obtained is extremely limited, and these targets were discovered more than a decade ago and it takes a long time, usually 10 to 20 years. With the continuous progress of genomics, transcriptome, proteomics and sequencing technology, more and more new genes and proteins have been found, which is expected to select suitable antibody drug targets.\\nWhat are the criteria for screening antibody drug targets? In the case of antineoplastic drug targets, first of all, there should be differences in target expression, such as differences between normal and tumor tissues, or loss of expression in key host organs, or persistent expression in the progress of the disease. Second, the target should play a role, when the use of antibodies for treatment, the antigen cannot be easily degraded by enzymes. The production of high affinity antibodies from known therapeutic targets is not a major obstacle, but the main challenge is to screen target molecules.\\nNow, scientists have used humanized antibody technology and fully human antibody technology, hoping to find some better antibody targets through the human immune system, so as to develop better antibody drugs. The fully human antibody technology is optimized by human-mouse hybridoma technology, human-human hybridoma technology, B cell immortalization and high-efficiency and high-throughput fully human antibody library technology. The selection, maturation and production of antibodies are all formed in the human body, so they are all human antibodies in the strict sense. Antibody targeting, antibody production and post-transcriptional modification are all completed by the human immune system after a series of screening. The antibodies produced by this technique have the best natural affinity and binding power, and act more effectively on the human body. High-efficiency and high-throughput fully human antibody library technology will be able to secrete antibodies of the target cell isolation, purification, enrichment and proliferation. The specificity of the antibody secreted by B cell subclone can be screened and identified by ELISPOT, ELISA or hemolytic plaque test. The gene sequence of the target antibody was obtained from the monoclonal cultured cell line, and the prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and transferred into engineering bacteria or cells to reconstruct the activity of the antibody.\\n2.Immunogenicity Analysis of Monoclonal Antibody Drugs\\nAt present, the common adverse reactions of monoclonal antibodies are mainly caused by their immunogenicity. The anti-drug antibodies caused by immunogenicity have a great influence on the safety and efficacy of the drug. Immunogenicity is one of the decisive factors in the development of biotech drugs, so their immunogenicity should be taken into account when evaluating drug safety. To this end, scientists have taken measures to improve the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibody drugs, such as humanization of antibodies, improvement of solubility, protein modification (such as protein polyethylene glycol modification) and improvement of effector molecule function.\\nFigure 3. Polyethylene glycol modification of antibodies.\\nThe current methods for evaluating and analyzing the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa), liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS), surface plasma resonance (SPR), electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). However, these methods have not yet reached a unified conclusion on the critical value of immunogenicity, and the critical value of immunogenicity is different due to different distribution laws and calculation companies, which makes it impossible to unify the acceptance criteria among different drugs. However, with the continuous progress of molecular biology technology, the humanized components of monoclonal antibodies have been improved, and even the whole human antibodies have been reached. Improving the binding and effector molecular function of these antibodies, combined with protein modification, is expected to avoid the immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies. At the same time, improving the immunogenicity detection method, unifying and standardizing it will make the clinical trial have clear guiding principles, and finally accelerate the clinical application of monoclonal antibody drugs.\\n3.High-throughput Animal Cell Expression Technique\\nIn terms of protein expression system, in recent years, scientists have developed and optimized the expression system of many antibody molecules, such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammal cells, plant cell expression systems and in vitro expression systems. Among them, mammalian cell expression system has many important advantages, such as high activity and good stability, and has become the most important expression system in the manufacture of antibody biotechnology products.\\nFrom the point of view of the scale, speed and function of antibody preparation, the development of high-throughput antibody preparation technology is very important. Large-scale and efficient culture of mammal cells is the main mode of production and key bottleneck technology of biomedical products. At present, there are flow culture technology and perfusion culture technology in the world.\\n4.Construction & Optimization of Humanized and Fully Human Antibodies.\\nWith the development of immunology and molecular biology, DNA recombination technology is more and more used in antibody construction and optimization. The techniques for the construction and optimization of humanized antibodies include resurfacing antibody and reshaped antibody. Resurfacing antibody refers to the humanization of amino acid residues on the surface of heterogenous antibodies. The principle of this method is to replace only the regions which are obviously different from the surface of human antibody, and to replace amino acids similar to the surface residues of human antibody on the basis of maintaining antibody activity and reducing heterogenicity. In addition, there should not be too many segments to be replaced, and the residues that could affect the size of the side chain, charge, hydrophobicity, or may form hydrogen bonds, which influence the conformation of the complementary determining region (CDR) of antibody, should not be replaced as far as possible. The reshaped antibody refers to the antibody constructed by the splicing of the antigen-binding residues of the heterogenous antibody with the human antibody, including complementary determining region transplantation, partial complement determining region transplantation and specific determining region transplantation.\\nFigure 4. Chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies.\\nBoth light and heavy chains of humanized antibodies come from human beings and are the development region of therapeutic antibodies. At present, there are antibody library screening techniques for the construction and optimization of humanized antibodies, such as chain replacement and genetic engineering mice to prepare humanized antibodies. The more mature antibody library screening techniques include phage antibody library, synthetic antibody library and ribosome display technology.\\nAntibodomics technology is based on genomics and proteomics, combined with hybridoma technology and genetic engineering antibody technology, after high-throughput screening of antibody targets, the establishment of large-scale antibody library, and finally applied. Compared with the traditional monoclonal antibody technology, the antibody library technology has the advantages of large library capacity, more species screening, easier to obtain highly active monoclonal antibodies against specific antigen epitopes and so on. At the same time, the antibody library technology is more timesaving, labor-saving, efficient and economical in the screening process.\\nMice are still the easiest animal species for immunization and subsequent genetic engineering, but the mouse antibody V region gene is still obtained through the mouse antibody library. In order to make it safe for clinical use, follow-up humanized transformation must be carried out. The transgenic mouse technology of fully human antibody developed in the past two years enables us to prepare a human immune antibody library through transgenic mice with a complete set of human antibody genes, from which we can directly screen the V region gene of the fully human antibody with therapeutic value. There is no need for humanized transformation.\\n5.Development of New Antibody Drugs\\nTraditional antibody drugs inhibit tumor growth by blocking a single signal pathway, and the drug resistance of antibody drugs is easy to appear in clinic. Therefore, bispecific antibody (BsAb) came into being. By means of genetic engineering, two antibody fragments targeting different antigens are combined together, which has two antigen binding sites, which can play a synergistic role and improve the therapeutic effect. This structural design can effectively improve the pharmacokinetic process of antibody drugs in vivo and enhance the clinical therapeutic effect. However, the design of BsAb with good curative effect, high stability and conducive to production still needs to be further studied.\\nThe antibody drugs on the market in recent years reflect the new trend of the development of the next generation of antibody drugs. The first direction is to make antibody drugs have a smaller molecular weight, so that they have better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and are easier to manufacture on a large scale, such as Fab fragment, Fab\u2019 fragment, F(ab\u2019)2 fragment, Single-chain variable fragment (scFv), single domain antibody (sdAb), diabody, triabody and minibody. The second direction is to connect at least two molecules with certain biological functions to form fusion proteins based on known drug molecules, such as bispecific antibody, trifunctional antibody, synthetic antibody (synbody), antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).\\nAntibody-drug couplers are composed of monoclonal antibodies and small molecular drugs with therapeutic effect. These drugs realize the targeted delivery of chemical drugs to tumor tissue with the help of antibodies. The antibody-drug conjugate has high stability in the blood, and the drug molecules will not fall off, so the toxic and side effects are small, but the inhibitory effect on tumor cells is much higher than that of naked antibodies. This design strategy can not only improve the killing ability of antibody drugs, but also improve the treatment window of small molecular chemicals.\\nFigure 5. Antibody-drug conjugate.\\nMonoclonal antibody drugs provide a new way for the treatment of a variety of diseases. At present, monoclonal antibody drugs have been widely used in the clinical treatment of tumors and other diseases. From the perspective of anti-tumor monoclonal antibody drug development process, it is mainly divided into five parts: target discovery, target selection, antigen preparation, selection of monoclonal antibody preparation technology and antibody function identification. Through the technical characteristics of these links, we can find the risk factors that affect the R&D results, find the risk factors, and use the thinking and methods of risk management to analyze. Different technologies used in the preparation of monoclonal antibodies will encounter different challenges. For this reason, it is necessary for developers to carry out specific analysis of specific problems and constantly overcome these technical challenges in order to develop truly useful monoclonal antibodies and bring new life-saving drugs to patients.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"factoid","error":null,"n":1}

That\u2019s conclusive proof that you need to negotiate, but it\u2019s not enough to just give ...\\nNieuwmeijer(1992) states, Negotiation is an essential part of our everyday life; just as we cannot exist without communicating, so we can barely exist without negotiating.\\nNegotiation is a basic way of getting what one wants from another, it is an exchange of information through communication. This also serves to continue or discontinue the relationship. The purpose of this communication exchange is to reach agreement between parties who have certain things in common while disagreeing on others.\\nLewicki (2003) states, Negotiations occur for either of these reasons: (1) to create something new that neither party could do on his or her own, or (2) to resolve a problem or dispute between the parties.\\nBecause people can negotiate about so many different things, understanding the fundamental processes of negotiation is essential for anyone who works with other people. Also, in many situations, there are lots of permutations of outcomes than one can imagine & our actions can have much more impact on producing these outcomes. Learning & Understanding negotiation therefore is quintessential to have a grip with this complexity.\\nUNDERSTANDING BASIC PRINCIPLES\\nFowler(1990) observes that the procedures and language of negotiation vary with the type of negotiation involved. Yet, the basic principles and much of the psychology of the process remains the same.\\nNegotiation is a process, which involves a range of skills. To handle this process effectively, one needs to identify the skills which are relevant to any particular negotiating episode & for that its important to recognize the elements or principles of negotiation. Following are Seven Principles, which are common to all forms of Negotiation:\\n1. Involves two or more parties with a common interest & expect each other\u2019s co-operation to achieve a satisfactory resolution.\\nAll over the world, people are classified into three categories. These three classifications include: lower class, middle class, and the upper class. Low income people are those with the least money, whereas the upper classes are the rich. The lower class seems to have closer family ties. Many use their family to make up for things they can\\'t have. A majority of these families are larger in size. ...\\n2. Parties start with a difference of views & opinions but share some degree of interest.\\n3. Initially consider Negotiation a more satisfactory way rather than coercion or Arbitration.\\n4. Both parties consider the possibility of persuading the other to modify their initial stance. Both parties are supposed to be willing to compromise.\\n5. Both parties retain some hope of a final agreement, which is acceptable by both when their ideal outcomes prove unattainable.\\n6. Both parties have equal influence or power-real or assumed- over the other.\\n7. There is an underlying human element in all forms of Negotiation. The progress of negotiation is strongly influenced by emotions and attitudes and not just by logic of both the parties.\\nDepending upon the nature, personality traits & the ability to take stances while Negotiating, Johnson(1993) and Nieuwmeijer(1988) have classified the negotiators & Negotiation Styles\/Strategies as:\\n1. Hard Bargainers\/ Forcing\/Adversarial\\nThese are the people who are tough & stubborn. They have an attitude of \u201cTake it or Leave it\u201d. They attempt to win the Negotiation through Power, Pressure, Fear or Intimidating. They like to make trades on their own terms without the possibility of meeting in the halfway. This style is effective in cases where the other party\/people can\u2019t think of a better alternative & are uncertain of themselves & the situation, sometimes when people are looking to save their energy & efforts required to put up a strong confrontation to such Hard Bargainers. Whereas some give in to a Hard bargainer, owing to the suspicious & deceptive atmosphere of the business world, where the Hard bargainer appears to be straightforward & honest.\\nHowever, the hard bargainers are at a risk of damaging their relationships with people owing to their stubborn & rigid nature. Owing to this they may wound their friends & make it difficult for their adversaries to drop their hostility. They\u2019re also at a risk of losing their credibility if they fail to enforce the Fear or Pressure tactics. Also, many people try to bypass Hard bargainers & in some cases, the hard bargainer may miss out on a good deal.\\nNegotiation is a common human activity. Everybody negotiate in his or hers personal and professional lives and it is an important part of the competitive modern life. Negotiations can occur over dealing with people, business contracts, official matters, service, buying products and relationships. Also, in the tourism industry needs good negotiation skills for business successfully. Tourism ...\\n2. Soft Bargainers\/ Accommodating\\nThese are the ones who attempt to prevail by being agreeable & who are flexible in their approach & also by nature. They appear friendly & have good amount of influence over people. Soft bargainers are people who don\u2019t like to catch too much attention & do not like conflicts or to get into them. Also they tend to avoid harsh confrontations. Some use the Soft Bargaining strategy if the issue is not important or they\u2019re unwilling to fight.\\n3. Tit-for-Tat Bargainers\/ Compromising\\nThese are the persuasive bargainers, falling in between the Hard Bargainers & Soft Bargainers, who promote goal-oriented behavior by rejecting both Hard Bargaining & Soft Bargaining measures. They think of achieving their negotiation goals through Punishment & Reward. These bargainers let the other side make their first move. If the move is positive, they Reward the other party by making a positive move as well. If the first move is negative, they dish out a negative move by handing over a Punishment. This strategy sometimes helps to reinforce the kind of behavior, which is expected from the other side. Since this approach is based on cool & preplanned responses, it doesn\u2019t allow the bargainer to be fooled by kindness or blinded by anger and a desire to take revenge.\\n4. Principled Bargainers\/ Collaborative \/Non-Adversarial\\nThese are the Bargainers who have a Strategic approach towards Negotiations. These can be Hard or Soft Bargainers who follow some Strategies to achieve their Negotiation Goals. They believe that each of the above approaches has its own advantages depending upon the person\u2019s persona, however much of its effectiveness is lost if a Negotiator falls into a predictable pattern. These Bargainers or Strategy involves Separating the people from the problem, Focusing on interests of the involved parties and Invents options for mutual gain.\\nHowever, (Spector, 1977) observed that one may use an approach that satisfies their personality & fits their preferred self-image rather than one that is suited to accomplishing their negotiating goal\\nSTAGES IN NEGOTIATION\\nFowler (1990), believes that The Negotiating Process is not a single activity, rather it proceeds over a period of time & has a series of Stages. Fowler (1986) has put these stages precisely, in comparison to other authors (Johnson,1993; Lewicki,2003; Nicholson,2004; Nieuwmeijer,1988), which are:\\nThe Term Paper on The Process of Contract Formation Explaining the Methods by Which the Courts Decides Whether or Not the Parties Have Reached an Agreement.\\nTo establish whether the parties have formed a contract, the courts begin from examining the elements of offer, acceptance, whether or not there was a consideration or the bargain and the contractual intent to make a binding contract and any other external positive factors. The coincidence of offer and corresponding acceptance results in a contract. In some instances contracts are inferred from ...\\n1. A PREPARATION Stage; before the Negotiation begins; the background, or sequence of events which lead to Negotiation.\\n2. The Actual Negotiating Process-the interaction which leads to an agreement about an Outcome.\\n3. The Implementation of the Agreement; the extent to which the Agreement reached has its desired effect and is effectively implemented.\\nA lot of thinking goes into the Preparation Stage, as one has to set the OUTCOMES\/ GOALS one wishes to have from Negotiation. Secondly, one must get as much information as possible about the other party\/parties & their positions like any outside pressure viz. Economic, Social, Political, Familial or Time that can affect the Negotiation. One must also keep these influences in mind and utilize them from the opening stage of setting Outcomes to the final stage of agreeing onto the next step.\\nFowler(1986) defines the following three possible settlement levels or expected Outcomes which one should plan for:-\\n1. The ideal or best possible Outcome.\\n2. The Expected Settlement Outcome.\\n3. The Worst, though still just acceptable Outcome.\\nKennedy, Benson & Macmillan describe this as the \u2018L-I-M\u2019 approach, where L is what the Negotiator would Like to achieve, I is what it is Intended to achieve & M is what Must be achieved as the bare minimum. (Anon, cited in Effective Negotiation, Fowler,1986)\\nThese outcomes should be considered from the other party\u2019s viewpoint as well as one\u2019s own.\\nThe Actual Negotiating Process is where, one has to practice his soft skills in order to achieve their desired Outcomes. Various authors like Johnson (1993), Nicholson & Pillutla (2004), Lewicki (2003) have illustrated many stages & pattern that constitute this stage but Fowler (1986) points out that most effective negotiations follow a six-stage pattern, which are:\\ni. Defining the issue: No negotiation can be effective unless the involved parties have a common understanding of what & why it is they\u2019re discussing and what each is seeking to achieve.\\n... two negotiations are the same, but the outcome usually depends on three factors: (a) the bargaining power of the parties, (b) information each party ... bargaining , and (f) documenting the agreement. 1. Defining the desired results to be achieved \u2013 This stage begins as the acquisition team ...\\nii. Defining initial positions: Each side puts up what it is seeking & their stance on it.\\niii. The Argument: A stage where the initial positions are challenged & tested.\\niv. Exploring Possibilities: both the parties evaluate new ideas & possibilities surfaced through discussions & debates.\\nv. Defining Proposals: Based on the arguments & evaluated proposals, firm proposals are defined & if necessary discussed, debated & argued further, to eventually reach Proposals acceptable by both the parties.\\nvi. Defining & Concluding the Agreement: Eventually after much discussion & deliberation, Final Agreements & Proposals are agreed upon.\\nThe Implementation of the Agreement is where both the parties have finally reached upon an Agreement by mutual consent & now look forward towards implementing them. Fowler(1986) suggests that, to make Implementation effective, a Joint Implementation Review Team should be set up so that both the parties can ensure that the Agreement reached upon through Negotiation is implemented as per the Proposal.\\nNegotiations may not always produce successful results, as success never comes guaranteed. At times, it may seem impossible for both the parties to arrive on an acceptable agreement. In such cases, a Third Party Assistance or Intervention should be considered.\\nJohnson(1993), Lewicki et al(1985) & Fowler(1986) suggest three forms of assistance:\\n1. Conciliation: in which the conciliator assists the parties to reach their won eventual agreement\\n2. Mediation: in which the Mediator suggests a solution, which the parties may accept or reject.\\n3. Arbitration: in which parties agree in advance to accept the arbitrator\u2019s solution.\\nJohnson (1993) & Fowler (1986) consider Mediators as Conciliators & arbitrators as threateners & regard Mediation & Conciliation as effective ways to resolve disputes.\\nHowever, Lewicki et al (1985) consider Mediation to be the most effective way of dispute resolution in contrast to Arbitration.\\nThe researcher suggests that the employment of Third Party Assistance\/Intervention is purely dependent on the type & the outlook of the parties involved.\\nNegotiation Point \"Effective negotiation is not about conflict. It is not about deviance or dishonesty. It is not about posturing, or bullying, or threatening. Effective negotiation is about exhaustive preparation, utter clarity, heartfelt communication, and a sincere, demonstrated desire to fully understand not just your own needs, but the needs of the other party.\" Leigh Stienberg: Winning with ...\\nNegotiation might seem a specialist topic on face, but it is actually a very general activity, which every one practices in their daily life on a regular basis. Though the Negotiations carried out in the Business & Corporate World is much more structured & requires a good understanding of the Procedures & Processes carried out in Negotiation as its extensive & Intensive adding furthermore to the complexity.\\nNegotiation, even for a general purpose, involves a range of skills that one has to practice over the period of time to become a successful negotiator. Mostly, it\u2019s the nature & the personality of a person that makes one a good negotiator. However, one has to learn & practice the methods\/ approaches\/strategies of Negotiation over the period of time to become a Successful Negotiator.\\nNegotiation does involve a contest to accomplish one\u2019s desired outcomes but at the same point of time, one must take care that Negotiation should be used to eradicate dissents & disagreements and help to build relationships & not to destroy them or create resentment.\\nThe researcher understood that we all are different people having different views and opinions and Negotiation should be used as an effective way to co-exist in harmony.\\nApart from looking for one\u2019s own favorable outcome, a Successful Negotiator looks out for creating a Win-Win situation, so as to thrive in this ever-competitive business world.\\nNegotiation, like all similar things in our life may not be always successful. We have to compromise sometimes but even then if we don\u2019t have a decision at hand we can use help of a Third Party. A Third Party assistance can be of help as sometimes both the parties may miss out on some issues & the third party being neutral & an onlooker may provide a good solution.\\nAt the end of it all, the researcher concludes that everyone is a Negotiator, but to be a Successful Negotiator, one has to practice & hone some Negotiating Skills.', 'MEDIATION IS THE ESTABLISHED AND COURT AUTHORIZED APPROACH OF ALTERNATIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION.\\nNational Family Mediation Service cut out the stress of combating at court and save you the big cost of solicitors fees. You can, together with our professional trained arbitrators deal with the problems together, even if you have actually had difficulties interacting with each other in the past.\\nThe Fundamentals of Family Mediation\\nMediation is a voluntary, consensual procedure that utilizes an experienced, neutral third party to assist in the negotiation of disputes. The objective is to reach a binding settlement agreement.\\nCASES AMENABLE TO MEDIATION\\n\u201d Typically \u2026 almost any civil disagreement is amenable to mediation.\u201d\\nVirginia Supreme Court Chief Justice Carrico, 3\/27\/95\\nTHE ADVANTAGES OF MEDIATION\\nMaking use of mediation is increasing drastically across the country. The advantages of mediation are recognized to be significant and various.\\n- Control by parties\u2013 The celebrations remain in charge of the result.\\n- Opportunity for much better results\u2013 The parties comprehend their disagreement much better than any court or jury could.\\n- Effective\u2013 Approximately 85% of cases dealt with by The National Family Mediation Service reach settlement.\\n- Greater compliance\u2013 Parties are more likely to comply with a mediated result than with a judgment or an arbitration award.\\n- Reduced time and expense- Mediation can be concluded in a single day or in a series of shorter sessions over a time period selected by the parties.\\n- Voluntary, consensual process\u2013 The parties stay in control. The result is figured out by the celebrations.\\n- Preserved, enhanced relationships between parties\u2013 Protecting or improving relationships is specifically essential in family cases where the celebrations might have ongoing dealings with each other or with children or other family members.\\n- Reduced tension and disruptions to ongoing activities.\\n- Improved relationships and skills\u2013 Mediation assists celebrations in future negotiations and conflict resolution.\\nCONSENTING TO MODERATE\\nThere are several ways to get to mediation.\\n- Frequently, one celebration chooses it would be useful to deal with the disagreement through mediation and suggests mediation to the other party.\\n- In pending litigation, the court frequently recommends or perhaps orders that the celebrations consider mediation. In either case, a call will get the process moving. A staff person will offer information about the mediation procedure and will address any concerns the celebrations or their lawyers might have.\\nSELECTING THE MEDIATOR\\nAs soon as the parties have agreed to mediate, The National Family Mediation Service works with the celebrations or their counsel to determine which of its mediators would be best matched to serve. The staff person managing the case may recommend one or more arbitrators based on the problems or profile of the case, although the parties or counsel may ask for a particular mediator as well.\\nThe standard role of a mediator is not to render a decision but to help with a negotiation and assist the celebrations in clarifying their problems and solving them. An additional role of a mediator may be to assess the concerns in disagreement if the celebrations select. These roles need to be considered in choosing a mediator. Other aspects to be thought about include the individual characteristics of the mediator:\\n- Interpersonal abilities\\n- Topic competence, if the parties want examination of the concerns\\nPrior to the mediation occurs, a staff person will speak with the parties or their lawyers to make sure that the case is suitable for mediation, and to discuss who will be present, the format of mediation, and costs. The mediator will carry out a conference call with the parties and\/or their legal representatives prior to the mediation.\\nTHE ATTORNEY AS SUPPORTER IN MEDIATION\\nLawyers have a vital role to play in making sure that celebrations have a clear understanding of their legal rights and commitments as they go through the mediation process. The mediated agreement that parties reach is just as strong as the details on which it is based, and it is critical that parties be well informed and clearly recommended about the implications of the choices they are making.\\nThe mediator initially discusses the process to be utilized and establishes the guideline. All those in attendance sign a mediation contract which, among other things, binds them to stringent confidentiality.\\nPRESENTATION OF VIEWS\\nOne celebration presents his or her view of the disagreement. The other party is then provided a chance to present his or her view of the case.\\nPROBLEM SOLVING\/NEGOTIATING STAGE\\nWith the help of the mediator, the celebrations and their counsel then start settlements. The mediator assists the parties focus on determining the real issues and addressing them.\\nWhile the legal aspects of the family dispute are certainly pertinent in the settlement, possible solutions might involve extra-legal concerns too. These non-legal matters are typically at the heart of the disagreement, yet they might not be adequately addressed in a courtroom.\\nThe negotiations continue till effectively finished or till the celebrations decide that they are unable to reach a resolution. The problem-solving may occur in confidential personal sessions (\u201d caucuses\u201d) in between each celebration and the mediator, with counsel, and might likewise take place over more than one session.\\nDepending upon the needs of the celebrations, family mediations may either be arranged to be finished in one day or in 2- to three-hour sessions. Typically, it is decided in the preliminary session that extra details needs to be gathered or that the celebrations need time outside of the mediation to complete particular tasks or to search for other possible solutions to a specific concern. In that case, the individuals simply set up a subsequent session to provide time to collect the necessary data.\\nA settlement agreement is reduced to writing when the parties reach arrangement. If concerns are raised throughout the legal evaluation, the celebrations can concur to return to mediation to talk about the issues and finalize the arrangement, if required.\\nSuch evaluation is offered just where (1) the celebrations request it; (2) the mediator believes that the asked for assessment is required and appropriate; (3) the mediator is qualified to provide such assessment; (4) there is adequate info on which to base such examination; and (5) such evaluation is offered in competent and fairly broad terms. As the mediation earnings, the needs of the parties might alter, and the nature of the services supplied may likewise alter, as the parties may ask for.\\nThe National Family Mediation Service do not provide other or legal expert recommendations. They do not anticipate particular outcomes to legal conflicts. While they may recommend possible alternatives by which to fix a disagreement, they do not suggest any specific service since the supreme decision is made by the parties.\\nGETTING READY FOR MEDIATION\\nThe celebrations and their counsel are well served by proper preparation, whether the attorney will be taking part in the actual mediation or not. Both the party and lawyer need to have:\\n- A sensible view of the problems in the conflict.\\n- A clear understanding of his or her objectives and requirements.\\n- An initial presentation of his or her viewpoint.\\n- A willingness to compromise.\\nIn addition, they should be prepared to:\\n- Check out choices to be considered in the basic session and in caucuses.\\n- Check out and evaluate different settlement scenarios.\\n- Find methods to help the other party to be flexible on crucial concerns.\\n- Check out a resolution\\nACHIEVING SUCCESS IN MEDIATION\\nAchieving success methods getting to the best possible outcome with the most affordable possible expense\u2013 both financial and emotional. The key to that outcome is that the choice maker in mediation is not a judge, the lawyers, or the mediator\u2013 the decision makers are the celebrations, with the advice and support of counsel. Thus, the most reliable method to mediation is most likely to be based upon a desire to reach a great resolution and end the conflict, rather than the combative style that might have identified earlier interactions in between the celebrations and their counsel. Being open to the possibility of crafting an imaginative service means that the result might be something that both celebrations can deal with more readily than if the outcome were imposed on them.\\nGenerally, the interaction happening within the mediation process is confidential. This encourages a complete exchange of feelings, views and facts.\\nBefore the mediation takes place, a personnel person will speak with the parties or their attorneys to make sure that the case is appropriate for mediation, and to discuss who will be present, the format of mediation, and expenses. The mediator will carry out a conference call with the celebrations and\/or their lawyers prior to the mediation. The mediated agreement that parties reach is only as strong as the info on which it is based, and it is crucial that celebrations be well informed and clearly encouraged about the ramifications of the decisions they are making.\\nAs the mediation proceeds, the needs of the parties might alter, and the nature of the services provided may also change, as the parties may ask for.\\nThe crucial to that outcome is that the decision maker in mediation is not a judge, the legal representatives, or the mediator\u2013 the decision makers are the parties, with the suggestions and support of counsel.\\nNational Family Mediation Service Videos\\nLearn More About MEDIATION From WikiPedia\\nMediation is an organized, interactive procedure where an objective 3rd party aids contesting celebrations in dealing with conflict via making use of specialized communication and arrangement techniques.

VC Experts enables practitioners all over the world to implement best practices through our premium content sections, see specifically the legal forms sections... contributed by experts from the best professional firms in the world.\\nWith these two structures in mind, let\\'s examine a third structure: straight common and straight, non-convertible, redeemable preferred. The explanation that follows and the analysis of the impact of this structure on management have been prepared with the assistance of Tom Claflin of Claflin Capital Management in Boston. Claflin Capital Management has managed some nine funds and, like other venture firms, has used this structure to partner successfully with portfolio companies in a majority of the deals the firm has financed. The common\/non-convertible preferred structure is used in a minority of venture deals; however, it strives to align investors and management in a way that is different from how a convertible preferred typically acts.\\nThe common\/non-convertible preferred structure requires these two securities to be sold as a unit. In this structure the overall values are the same. If we assume the same example as cited above, in which a model company receives a pre-money valuation of $3 million and seeks to raise $2 million, the investors will, with the common\/non-convertible preferred structure, also end up owning 40 percent of the company with their $2 million purchase. However, the investment is divided into two parts. Ninety percent of the investment, or $1.8 million, will purchase a non-convertible redeemable preferred, and 10 percent, or $200,000, will purchase 40 percent of the company\\'s common stock. The 90\/10 split is completely arbitrary; an 80\/20 split has also been used with success. The ratio may change in later rounds.\\nWhile there is an implied overall post-financing value of $5 million based on $2 million of capital exchanged for 40 percent of the equity, this structure brings about a lower pre-money valuation while maintaining management\\'s ownership percentage objective. The total value of the company\\'s common stock is now $500,000 because 40 percent of the common was purchased for $200,000. When the $1.8 million of preferred is added to the $500,000 of common, the total value of the company becomes $2.3 million. This is the break-even value on the investment. If the company is sold for $2.3 million or more, the investors at least get their investment back. The break-even in this example is less than half of the $5 million valuation for a common stock deal.\\nIn either the straight common stock or the convertible preferred stock structures, the investors would just get their cost back if the company were sold for $5 million. In the common\/non-convertible preferred structure, if the company were sold for $5 million, the $1.8 million of preferred would be paid off the top, leaving $3.2 million for the common shareholders. The investors\\' 40 percent common holdings would be worth $1.28 million, bringing the total to $3.08 million, or a gain of 54 percent, compared to a break-even for either of the other two approaches.\\nIn the case of a sale of the company for $20 million with the common\/non-convertible preferred approach, the $1.8 million preferred comes off the top, and the remaining $18.2 million is divided among the shareholders. The investors\\' share of the common is $7.28 million, bringing their total to $9.08 million. This produces an extra $1.08 million, or a 14 percent better return than either the common or convertible preferred approach. In the traditional convertible preferred approach, the investors would have received $8 million for their effective 40 percent share as convertible preferred shareholders.\\nOn the downside, the common\/non-convertible preferred structure also works to the investors\\' advantage. The investors show a profit all the way down to a value of $2.3 million, where the investment reaches break-even. For example, at a $3 million valuation, $1.8 million of preferred comes off the top, leaving the investors\\' share of the common at $480,000 (40 percent of $1.2 million = $480,000). Thus, the investors would receive a total of $2.28 million if the company were sold for $3 million. Theoretically, for a value between $2.3 and $2 million, the convertible preferred approach is marginally better. However, at those levels, where management will not receive much from a sale, the preferred shareholders will likely be forced to give up some of their return to make the deal work.\\nImpact on Management\\nThe common\/non-convertible preferred approach is shown to be preferable from the investors\\' viewpoint. What is management\\'s viewpoint? In the above example, management\\'s return is potentially reduced as a function of the company\\'s requirement to pay off the $1.8 million of preferred. In the case of a merger, the preferred definitely reduces management\\'s share of the proceeds. If the company is sufficiently successful to pay off the preferred before being acquired, the negative impact to management is negligible. In the case of an IPO, as a practical matter, management\\'s ownership value is not reduced by this structure. In this case the preferred is redeemed out of the offering proceeds and is lost in the noise level of the transaction.\\nAlthough the redeemable feature of the common\/non-convertible preferred structure is a potential negative for management, there is a positive aspect, since the value of the common is driven down to one-tenth of the nominal value of a common or convertible preferred structure. This makes it somewhat easier to keep prices of the common lower for the benefit of pricing stock options for key management. To the extent that options are important to the management team, this can be a major advantage. Each equity percentage point has an option cost of $5,000 in the common\/non-convertible preferred approach. It cost $50,000 for each percentage in the common stock or preferred approach.\\nPerhaps most importantly, the common\/non-convertible preferred structure can benefit management by effecting a comparatively better valuation and less dilution for management. For example, if a common\/non-convertible preferred structure is acceptable to investors at a $3 million pre-financing valuation, as in our company model, a convertible preferred might drop down to a $2.5 million pre-financing valuation and a common stock deal at a $1.5 million pre-financing valuation. The relative valuations of these three alternative structures should settle out where investors are indifferent as to which they would choose. The overall impact to the management as shareholders depends upon the ultimate exit value for the company.\\nAlignment of the Interests of Stakeholders\\nPerhaps the most obvious and strikingly important advantage to both management and investors of the common\/non-convertible preferred structure is the clear alignment of interests the structure effects. Under such a structure, all participants hold common stock in the company. While the non-convertible preferred portion of an investor\\'s holding is senior to common, and therefore likely to protect a substantial majority of the preferred investor\\'s investment (90 percent in the above example), the remaining investment represents the majority of the investors\\' actual ownership in the company. As a result, the investor is, at the same time, keenly aware of the common goal of maximizing the value of common stock.\\nAlignment is further enforced by the simple fact that investors in the common\/non-convertible preferred approach have paid one-tenth the price for their stock that would have been paid in a straight common stock structure. Consequently, they have a much higher probability of achieving a profit in their common stock investment sooner than in either of the other alternative approaches.\\nThat the common\/non-convertible preferred investors also hold non-convertible preferred has the subtle effect of motivating the non-convertible preferred to be more supportive when times get tough, as well as in the event of a follow-on financing.\\nWhen the situation becomes difficult, the preferred is more likely to be sacrificed to protect the investors\\' equity interest. This is a subtle, but significant, difference between the convertible preferred and the common\/non-convertible preferred structures.\\nIn the event of a follow-on financing, the common\/non-convertible preferred stockholder is also likely to be more supportive of what might otherwise be a less attractive valuation to the pure convertible-preferred shareholder when the company is having considerable difficulty raising new capital. Consider our earlier example of a company that raised $2 million at a $3 million pre-money valuation. In this example, the original shareholders, in effect, hold 60 percent of the value in the company; the value of the company attributable to new investors represents 40 percent. For the purposes of this example, let\\'s assume that were the financing in the form of a straight convertible security, 32,000 shares were issued at $62.50 to generate $2 million. If $2 million had been raised in the form of a bundle of common\/non-convertible preferred securities, let\\'s assume that 10 percent of the round, or $200,000, was issued in the form of 32,000 shares of common stock at $6.25, and 90 percent of the round, or $1.8 million, was issued in the form of 32,000 non-convertible preferred shares at $56.25.\\nClearly, a follow-on investment in which a venture group of new investors proposes a new convertible preferred investment at $50 per share will create a different economic result, depending on whether the previous round had been in the form of convertible preferred stock or a combination of non-convertible preferred\/common. Were the round in straight convertible preferred stock, the investor whose prior investment had been invested at $62.50 is forced to write-down his investment. The 32,000 shares valued at $62.50 per share need, in effect, to be re-priced on the books of the investor at $50.00. In either scenario, the new imputed value for the company is $4 million (80,000 shares at $50). A $2 million initial investment in convertible preferred would therefore need to be re-priced at $1.6 million on the books of the convertible preferred investor.\\nIn contrast, the investors with common\/non-convertible preferred securities would actually have little trouble with such an investment layered on top of their initial investment. Because the non-convertible preferred is non-convertible, its value must, in effect, be subtracted from the imputed value of the company before determining the value of the common. The non-convertible preferred\/common investor actually would be able to justify a write-up of their overall investment by 34 percent, assuming at an imputed pre-financing value of $4 million. (80,000 shares x $50 = $4 million, less $1.8 million preferred, leaves $2.2 million for the common shareholders. 40 percent of $2.2 million = $880,000, + the $1.8 million preferred = $2.68 million, which, divided by the $2 million cost, = a 34 percent gain.)\\nImpact of Common and Non-convertible Preferred on Term Sheet StructureNaturally the common\/non-convertible preferred structure requires that the term sheet agreed to between investors and the company reflect a structure that is modified slightly as compared to the \"standard\" terms one would expect in a term sheet that involves conventional convertible preferred.\\nThe nature of the common\/non-convertible preferred structure contemplated in the financing will require a distinct form of language and structure for the term sheet that outlines such a financing. The distinct structure contemplated will first be outlined in the \"New Securities Offered\" section of the term sheet. In this section both non-convertible preferred and common shares to be purchased by the new investor need to be stipulated. The term sheet will also require significantly different language in the section \"Rights, Preferences and Privileges of the Non-Convertible Preferred.\" In this section, the \"Dividends\" language will not necessarily contemplate dividends with respect to the non-convertible preferred stock. While a dividend may accrue, the non-convertible\/common structure typically will assume that if a future financing or liquidity event does not transpire (eliminating buy-out of the non-convertible preferred), the non-convertible preferred will be bought out in full from company earnings during a stipulated time period. This will be clearly articulated in the \"Liquidation\" and \"Redemption\" clauses. Consequently, no \"Conversion and Automatic Conversion\" language will be required with respect to the non-convertible preferred, as the security is, by definition, non-convertible. \"Dilution\" clause language will also not contemplate dilution of the non-convertible preferred. Its value will, in effect, act like a debt instrument and not be subject to dilution. While the non-convertible preferred will require \"Voting Rights,\" as well as \"Protective Provisions\" and \"Special Board Approval Items\" language, \"Registration Rights\" language will not pertain to the non-convertible preferred, only to the common.\\nReprint permission from and originally published in Deal Terms, Aspatore Books, All Rights Reserved.']","user_category":"expert","question_formulation_category":"natural","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"verification","error":null,"n":1}

In cardiovascular management, nutrigenomics encompasses genetic testing, metabolomics, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nutrient-genetic interactions, and the newest concept, gene expression testing. These tests provide indication of whether or not your patients\u2019 genetics are expressed and their risk of cardiovascular disease.\\nMost genetic expression is driven by inflammation, and the majority of the genes, once turned on, promote an inflammatory response. Most of the loci on genes associated with myocardial infarction (MI), Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) are expressed through inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune-vascular dysfunction. This dynamic starts in the vascular endothelium and vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes leading to angina, coronary artery vasospasm, obstructive coronary heart disease, diastolic and systolic dysfunction and cardiomyopathy. Regardless of the type of insult, blood vessels respond to insults via these same three mechanisms: inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune-vascular dysfunction.\\nConsequently, the inflammatory pathways have become the primary focus in the management of genetic expression and of genetic risk for CVD.\\nNutritional factors provide information that determines whether our genes are turned on or turned off, with a corresponding beneficial or detrimental outcome. One change in a single ubiquitous nutrient such as magnesium may cause 300 or 400 different changes in downstream metabolic pathways and cardiovascular function and health.\\nThere are several issues we want to define when we initially examine patients. One is their genetic profile, the genes they were dealt. There are also epigenetic influences that are not genetic such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coded messenger RNA. The final aspect is gene expression, as genes express themselves in response to nourishment or insults from different types of information coming in from the environment. Genetics have become important in determining not only dietary intake, but also medication intake in many patients, based on their genetic profile.\\nThere are more than 400 known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. They all ultimately result in the same three finite responses in the body: inflammation, oxidative distress, and\/or immune dysfunction. These risk factors ultimately translate into vascular disease.\\nGenes Relevant to Cardiovascular Risk\\nOne of the primary genes we are now measuring is the 9p21 gene, which increases the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Patients who have a heterozygote SNP for 9p21 have a risk for MI that is increased by 50%. When a patient has a homozygote SNP, risk goes up to approximately 100%, so this is one of the top genetic risks that we measure for CHD and MI.\\nApo E4 Genotype\\nThe Apo E genotype is not new information, but we must remind ourselves that this genotype increases risk for CVD and people with the genotype have varied responses, particularly to different types of fats in their diet.\\nOne of the newest genes that we\u2019re looking at is COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) which provides instructions for the breakdown of norepinephrine and epinephrine. If this genetic SNP is present, the patient will have higher levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine and increased risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease. There is a variation in response depending on which of the specific COMPT SNPs the patient carries; for example, aspirin or vitamin E may be beneficial for patients with one type of COMT SNP, but detrimental if one of the other SNPs is present.\\nThe risk of myocardial infarction can be increased by 71% if a SNP affecting glutathione metabolism (GSH-Px) is present. This selenium-dependent enzyme expresses different capacities to neutralise hydroxyl radicals and other oxidative molecules related to increases in oxidative stress and CVD. For these patients, glutathione peroxidase and selenium levels would be key measurements to track for the risk of CVD.\\nThere is a whole host of genetic influences on blood pressure, probably 30 different genes that we have recognised to date, all of which are helpful in determining both risk for hypertension and risk for cardiovascular target organ damage, as well as response to nutrients, caffeine, medications, and various types of diets.\\nWe know, for example, that someone who consumes large amounts of caffeine and has the SNP, cytochrome P-450-1A2, will increase their risk of tachycardia, hypertension, aortic stiffness, and myocardial infarction. Of course, one could have the right type of SNP for caffeine detoxification and that will reduce their risk. Approximately 60% of the population has cytochrome P-450-1A2FF, which is the wrong kind of gene to have, because they are slow metabolisers and their risk for CHD and MI actually go up with caffeine consumption.\\nBefore you tell patients it\u2019s okay to be drinking caffeine, you need to check the gene for cytochrome P-450 function.\\nGenetic assessments can play a role in both undertanding and mitigating risks associated with cardiovascular disease.

These individuals may also have other symptoms, including ataxia (problems with balance and movement) and cognitive disabilities.\\nAniridia and Wilms\u2019 Tumor Development\\nRoughly 30% of persons with sporadic aniridia can have WAGR syndrome. Wilms\u2019 tumor is an uncommon kidney based cancer that primarily affects Younger people. WAGR is an acronym for a list of conditions that commonly occur together in this syndrome:\\nW: Wilms\u2019 tumor\\nG: Genitourinary abnormalities, i.e. abnormalities in the reproductive and\/or urinary organs\\nR: Mental Retardation\\nTherefore, it is important for your eye doctor to evaluate your family history if you have aniridia. If you have sporadic aniridia, regular ultrasounds are necessary to screen for Wilms\u2019 tumor.\\nHow Does Aniridia Affect the Eyes?\\nAniridia is named for its effects upon the iris. This disorder can involves global functioning of many structures of the eye, most of which can impair vision.\\nThe effects of aniridia can vary significantly from person to person. Some individuals exhibit only mild effects from the disorder, while others have profound ocular abnormalities:\\nSome persons have only minimal underdevelopment of the iris that is barely noticeable to the untrained eye, while others have partial absence of the iris, and still others have total absence of the iris. Even in persons with \u201ctotal\u201d absence of the iris, there is usually a very rudimentary iris tissue remnant that can be seen during a careful eye examination under the microscope.\\nLight Sensitivity (Photophobia)\\nSince the iris helps block and absorb some of the light entering the eye, people with aniridia may be very light sensitive (photophobic) and report symptoms of glare.\\nEither abnormal development of the angle (the area of the eye responsible for draining aqueous fluid from the eye), blockage of the angle from the rudimentary iris stump, or narrowing of the angle can lead to glaucoma.\\nPeople with aniridia may have a deficiency in the limbal stem cells. These are stem cells that arise in the limbus. The limbus is an area at the border of the conjunctiva, which is the thin translucent tissue over the white surface of the eye, and the cornea, the transparent dome-shaped tissue that forms the front part of your eye, through which you can see the colored iris. These stem cells are responsible for maintaining the health and integrity of the cornea.\\nAs a result of a deficiency in the limbal stem cells, the conjunctiva can grow over the cornea, the cornea cannot heal easily from injuries or scratches, and the cornea ultimately can undergo scarring or vascularization (growth of abnormal blood vessels into the normally clear cornea). These corneal changes can impair vision.\\nLens Abnormalities (Crystalline)\\nRetinal Developmental Problems\\nIndividuals with aniridia often have foveal hypoplasia, meaning underdevelopment of macula lutea, which is the part of the retina responsible for fine visual acuity; they may also have hypoplasia of the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. \u201cHypoplasia\u201d is a term that refers to a deficiency or underdevelopment of a tissue or body structure.\\nInfants with aniridia may exhibit abnormal, involuntary, rapid side-to-side or up-and-down movements of the eyes called nystagmus.\\nHow Is Aniridia Treated?\\nSince aniridia can affect the eyes in a multitude of ways, aniridia treatment is similarly multifaceted:\\nOpaque or colored contact lenses can give the appearance of an iris to improve one\u2019s appearance, or for cosmetic purposes, as well as to improve vision and minimize glare\/photophobia.\\nAbsorptive sunglasses can also help with symptoms of photophobia and glare.\\nSome individuals also may be candidates for surgical placement of an artificial iris, though this procedure may be associated with complications.\\nLubrication with artificial tears can help maintain the health of the cornea.\\nSignificant corneal disease may require more aggressive surgery, including transplants and\/or stem cell transplantation to replace some of the missing stem cells.\\nIndividuals who have cataracts may require surgery to remove the cataract.\\nPeople with aniridia should be monitored closely for glaucoma and those who develop it should be treated accordingly, with medications, lasers, and\/or surgery.']","user_category":"novice","question_formulation_category":"search-query","premise_category":"direct","linguistic_category":"similar-to-document","answer_type_category":"procedural","error":null,"n":1}

How has our understanding of mathematical patterns and symmetries evolved from basic number sequences to modern physics applications?","gold":"Mathematical pattern analysis began with simple number sequences, like adding squares of digits (e.g., 145 -> 42 -> 20...) where numbers either reach 1 or enter a repeating cycle. This fundamental concept of cyclic patterns in finite sets evolved into more sophisticated symmetry applications in modern physics. Today, symmetries are fundamental to physics theories, described by Lie groups (for continuous symmetries) and finite groups (for discrete symmetries). These mathematical concepts now form the foundation of modern physics theories, including special relativity's Poincar\u00e9 group and the Standard Model's gauge symmetries based on SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) group.

Take any whole number between 1 and 999 inclusive and add the squares of the digits to get a new number. Try 145 and see what happens.Can you see that, whatever number we start with (between 1 and 999) we always get another number which is less than 1000. Let\\'s use this idea to look at a problem.\\nIn this problem, take any number (less than 1000), add the squares of its digits, and then go on repeating this until a pattern emerges. For example, if we take the number 193, we get the following sequence of numbers :\\n193 -> 91 -> 82 -> 68 -> 100 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1\\nOf course, when we reach 1 we will always get 1 thereafter. You were asked to start at 145, and you should have got the sequence\\n145 -> 42 -> 20 -> 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89 -> 145\\nand, of course, the sequence then starts repeating itself. Try some numbers yourself to see what patterns you get.\\nNumbers, like 193, which start a sequence leading to the number 1 are sometimes called \\' happy numbers \\'.\\nAfter trying other starting points you should have been able to guess that, whatever the starting point, eventually you will always reach either 1 (and then you will stay at 1), or the `cycle\\' given above. One of the aims of these articles is\\n(1) to try to explain why this is so, and\\n(2) to consider other situations of this type (i.e. generalisations of it).\\nThe first important step is to show that whichever number we start with (less than 1000) we always get a number less than 1000. Let us see why this is true, and then see why it is important.\\nWe shall consider numbers greater than 1000 in a later article but you may like to try some out now.\\nAny number less than 1000 has only one, two or three digits, and each of the digit is, of course, at most 9. This means that when we add the squares of the digits, the largest number we can get is 3 x (9 x 9), which is 243, and this is less than 1000. It is worth noting here that although this little argument is very simple, it is (as we said earlier) very important. In mathematics, arguments can be simple and important, or difficult and unimportant (or, quite often, difficult and important, or simple and unimportant). Being difficult and being important are NOT the same thing !\\nNow let us see why the argument given above is important. The point is that the eventual behaviour of our sequences of numbers is a very general phenomenon. To illustrate this, suppose that we can now start from any of the numbers 0,1,2, ... ,12, and that now our new rule (corresponding to \"add the squares of the digits\") is cube the number and take the remainder after throwing away multiples of 10. This gives the following situation :\\n|0 -> 0||1 -> 1||2 -> 8||3 -> 7||4 -> 4|\\n|5 -> 5||6 -> 6||7 -> 3||8 -> 2||9 -> 9|\\n|10 -> 0||11 -> 1||12 -> 8|\\nIn this case, whatever the starting point, after applying the rule a large number of times, we must end up with one of the six sequences\\n|0 -> 0 -> 0 ...||1 -> 1 -> 1 ...|\\n|2 -> 8 -> 2 -> 8 ...||3 -> 7 -> 3 -> 7 ...|\\n|6 -> 6 -> 6 ...||9 -> 9 -> 9 ...|\\nBecause this rule is different from the original rule, the possible eventual behaviour of the sequences is different ; the important point is that, wherever we start, we eventually get locked into a cyclic situation. The same is true for any rule whatever providing the rule takes us from a FINITE set to itself. It can break down, though, if we consider a set with infinitely many numbers in; for example, the rule \"add 1\" applied to the set of positive whole numbers NEVER leads to a cyclic situation.\\nYou should try the following example and see here what the cyclic situations are : the numbers from which you may start are 1,2, ... ,12, and the rule is as follows :\\n|1 -> 2||2 -> 7||3 -> 8||4 -> 6|\\n|5 -> 12||6 -> 7||7 -> 1||8 -> 3|\\n|9 -> 1||10 -> 3||11 -> 9||12 -> 11|\\nJust to persuade yourself that this always happens, make up an example for yourself (or your friend). To do this, you must\\n(1) Select a (finite) set of numbers ;\\n(2) give a rule which takes each of the numbers to another number in the set.\\nThen repeat the rule with each starting point until a pattern emerges.\\nSometimes, all the numbers in the set are in a cycle and sometimes they are not. In all of the examples we have seen so far there is at least one number which is not in one of the eventual cycles. If every number is in a cycle, we say that the rule is a PERMUTATION of the set. Here is an example of a permutation of the letters a , b , c , d , e , f , g, h , i ,j , k , l :\\n|a -> g||b -> j||c -> k||d -> i|\\n|e -> a||f -> h||g -> e||h -> b|\\n|i -> d||j -> f||k -> c||l -> l|\\nCheck that in this case every letter is already in a cycle.\\nCut an equilateral triangle out of paper, label the vertices a, b, c (on both sides of the paper), and mark the position of the triangle on a fixed piece of paper on the table. Now find a permutation of a, b, c ; for example, a -> a , b -> c , c -> b , and try to represent this by picking the triangle up and putting it down in the same place but with the vertex c where b was, etc. Repeat this with other permutations of a, b, c .\\nTry the same problem for a square. Note that for a square some permutations of the vertices a, b, c, d CANNOT be represented by picking the square up and putting it down again. Why is this ?\\nLater we shall get back to discussing the \"sums of squares of the digits rule\" ; the important point to note from the present discussion is that if we have a rule which takes each member of a set to another member of the same set, and if the set is finite, then, if we repeat the rule enough times, we always end up with a cyclic result. This means, for example, that in the case of the triangle, whatever permutation of a, b, c we choose, we will eventually get the triangle back with its vertices in their original positions.\\nA final problem : the ideas in this article tell us that if we work out the decimal expansion of a fraction (say of 1\/7, or 34\/87) we will eventually get a repeating decimal expansion.

Continuous and discrete transformations give rise to corresponding types of symmetries. Continuous symmetries can be described by Lie groups while discrete symmetries are described by finite groups (see Symmetry group).\\nThese two concepts, Lie and finite groups, are the foundation for the fundamental theories of modern physics. Symmetries are frequently amenable to mathematical formulations such as group representations and can, in addition, be exploited to simplify many problems.\\nArguably the most important example of a symmetry in physics is that the speed of light has the same value in all frames of reference, which is known in mathematical terms as Poincar\u00e9 group, the symmetry group of special relativity. Another important example is the invariance of the form of physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations, which is an important idea in general relativity.\\n- 1 Symmetry as a kind of invariance\\n- 2 Local and global symmetries\\n- 3 Continuous symmetries\\n- 4 Discrete symmetries\\n- 5 Mathematics of physical symmetry\\n- 6 Mathematics\\n- 7 See also\\n- 8 References\\n- 9 External links\\nSymmetry as a kind of invariance\\nInvariance is specified mathematically by transformations that leave some property (e.g. quantity) unchanged. This idea can apply to basic real-world observations. For example, temperature may be homogeneous throughout a room. Since the temperature does not depend on the position of an observer within the room, we say that the temperature is invariant under a shift in an observer\\'s position within the room.\\nSimilarly, a uniform sphere rotated about its center will appear exactly as it did before the rotation. The sphere is said to exhibit spherical symmetry. A rotation about any axis of the sphere will preserve how the sphere \"looks\".\\nInvariance in force\\nThe above ideas lead to the useful idea of invariance when discussing observed physical symmetry; this can be applied to symmetries in forces as well.\\nFor example, an electric field due to an electrically charged wire of infinite length is said to exhibit cylindrical symmetry, because the electric field strength at a given distance r from the wire will have the same magnitude at each point on the surface of a cylinder (whose axis is the wire) with radius r. Rotating the wire about its own axis does not change its position or charge density, hence it will preserve the field. The field strength at a rotated position is the same. This is not true in general for an arbitrary system of charges.\\nIn Newton\\'s theory of mechanics, given two bodies, each with mass m, starting from rest at the origin and moving along the x-axis in opposite directions, one with speed v1 and the other with speed v2 the total kinetic energy of the system (as calculated from an observer at the origin) is 1\u20442m(v12 + v22) and remains the same if the velocities are interchanged. The total kinetic energy is preserved under a reflection in the y-axis.\\nThe last example above illustrates another way of expressing symmetries, namely through the equations that describe some aspect of the physical system. The above example shows that the total kinetic energy will be the same if v1 and v2 are interchanged.\\nLocal and global symmetries\\nSymmetries may be broadly classified as global or local. A global symmetry is one that holds at all points of spacetime, whereas a local symmetry is one that has a different symmetry transformation at different points of spacetime; specifically a local symmetry transformation is parameterised by the spacetime co-ordinates. Local symmetries play an important role in physics as they form the basis for gauge theories.\\nThe two examples of rotational symmetry described above - spherical and cylindrical - are each instances of continuous symmetry. These are characterised by invariance following a continuous change in the geometry of the system. For example, the wire may be rotated through any angle about its axis and the field strength will be the same on a given cylinder. Mathematically, continuous symmetries are described by continuous or smooth functions. An important subclass of continuous symmetries in physics are spacetime symmetries.\\n|Group theory \u2192 Lie groups\\nContinuous spacetime symmetries are symmetries involving transformations of space and time. These may be further classified as spatial symmetries, involving only the spatial geometry associated with a physical system; temporal symmetries, involving only changes in time; or spatio-temporal symmetries, involving changes in both space and time.\\n- Time translation: A physical system may have the same features over a certain interval of time ; this is expressed mathematically as invariance under the transformation for any real numbers t and a in the interval. For example, in classical mechanics, a particle solely acted upon by gravity will have gravitational potential energy when suspended from a height above the Earth\\'s surface. Assuming no change in the height of the particle, this will be the total gravitational potential energy of the particle at all times. In other words, by considering the state of the particle at some time (in seconds) and also at , say, the particle\\'s total gravitational potential energy will be preserved.\\n- Spatial translation: These spatial symmetries are represented by transformations of the form and describe those situations where a property of the system does not change with a continuous change in location. For example, the temperature in a room may be independent of where the thermometer is located in the room.\\n- Spatial rotation: These spatial symmetries are classified as proper rotations and improper rotations. The former are just the \\'ordinary\\' rotations; mathematically, they are represented by square matrices with unit determinant. The latter are represented by square matrices with determinant \u22121 and consist of a proper rotation combined with a spatial reflection (inversion). For example, a sphere has proper rotational symmetry. Other types of spatial rotations are described in the article Rotation symmetry.\\n- Poincar\u00e9 transformations: These are spatio-temporal symmetries which preserve distances in Minkowski spacetime, i.e. they are isometries of Minkowski space. They are studied primarily in special relativity. Those isometries that leave the origin fixed are called Lorentz transformations and give rise to the symmetry known as Lorentz covariance.\\n- Projective symmetries: These are spatio-temporal symmetries which preserve the geodesic structure of spacetime. They may be defined on any smooth manifold, but find many applications in the study of exact solutions in general relativity.\\n- Inversion transformations: These are spatio-temporal symmetries which generalise Poincar\u00e9 transformations to include other conformal one-to-one transformations on the space-time coordinates. Lengths are not invariant under inversion transformations but there is a cross-ratio on four points that is invariant.\\nMathematically, spacetime symmetries are usually described by smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold. The underlying local diffeomorphisms associated with the vector fields correspond more directly to the physical symmetries, but the vector fields themselves are more often used when classifying the symmetries of the physical system.\\nSome of the most important vector fields are Killing vector fields which are those spacetime symmetries that preserve the underlying metric structure of a manifold. In rough terms, Killing vector fields preserve the distance between any two points of the manifold and often go by the name of isometries.\\nA discrete symmetry is a symmetry that describes non-continuous changes in a system. For example, a square possesses discrete rotational symmetry, as only rotations by multiples of right angles will preserve the square\\'s original appearance. Discrete symmetries sometimes involve some type of \\'swapping\\', these swaps usually being called reflections or interchanges.\\n- Time reversal: Many laws of physics describe real phenomena when the direction of time is reversed. Mathematically, this is represented by the transformation, . For example, Newton\\'s second law of motion still holds if, in the equation , is replaced by . This may be illustrated by recording the motion of an object thrown up vertically (neglecting air resistance) and then playing it back. The object will follow the same parabolic trajectory through the air, whether the recording is played normally or in reverse. Thus, position is symmetric with respect to the instant that the object is at its maximum height.\\n- Spatial inversion: These are represented by transformations of the form and indicate an invariance property of a system when the coordinates are \\'inverted\\'. Said another way, these are symmetries between a certain object and its mirror image.\\n- Glide reflection: These are represented by a composition of a translation and a reflection. These symmetries occur in some crystals and in some planar symmetries, known as wallpaper symmetries.\\nC, P, and T symmetries\\nThe Standard model of particle physics has three related natural near-symmetries. These state that the universe in which we live should be indistinguishable from one where a certain type of change is introduced.\\n- C-symmetry (charge symmetry), a universe where every particle is replaced with its antiparticle\\n- P-symmetry (parity symmetry), a universe where everything is mirrored along the three physical axes\\n- T-symmetry (time reversal symmetry), a universe where the direction of time is reversed. T-symmetry is counterintuitive (surely the future and the past are not symmetrical) but explained by the fact that the Standard model describes local properties, not global ones like entropy. To properly reverse the direction of time, one would have to put the big bang and the resulting low-entropy state in the \"future.\" Since we perceive the \"past\" (\"future\") as having lower (higher) entropy than the present (see perception of time), the inhabitants of this hypothetical time-reversed universe would perceive the future in the same way as we perceive the past.\\nThese symmetries are near-symmetries because each is broken in the present-day universe. However, the Standard Model predicts that the combination of the three (that is, the simultaneous application of all three transformations) must be a symmetry, called CPT symmetry. In  the 4 dimensional matrix description of P,T is through a diagonal matrix, the negative identity, as well as C. Hence CPT is the identity operator. CP violation, the violation of the combination of C- and P-symmetry, is necessary for the presence of significant amounts of baryonic matter in the universe. CP violation is a fruitful area of current research in particle physics.\\nThis section may contain misleading parts.(June 2015)\\nA type of symmetry known as supersymmetry has been used to try to make theoretical advances in the standard model. Supersymmetry is based on the idea that there is another physical symmetry beyond those already developed in the standard model, specifically a symmetry between bosons and fermions. Supersymmetry asserts that each type of boson has, as a supersymmetric partner, a fermion, called a superpartner, and vice versa. Supersymmetry has not yet been experimentally verified: no known particle has the correct properties to be a superpartner of any other known particle. Currently LHC is preparing for a run which tests supersymmetry.\\nMathematics of physical symmetry\\nContinuous symmetries are specified mathematically by continuous groups (called Lie groups). Many physical symmetries are isometries and are specified by symmetry groups. Sometimes this term is used for more general types of symmetries. The set of all proper rotations (about any angle) through any axis of a sphere form a Lie group called the special orthogonal group . (The 3 refers to the three-dimensional space of an ordinary sphere.) Thus, the symmetry group of the sphere with proper rotations is . Any rotation preserves distances on the surface of the ball. The set of all Lorentz transformations form a group called the Lorentz group (this may be generalised to the Poincar\u00e9 group).\\nDiscrete symmetries are described by discrete groups. For example, the symmetries of an equilateral triangle are described by the symmetric group .\\nAn important type of physical theory based on local symmetries is called a gauge theory and the symmetries natural to such a theory are called gauge symmetries. Gauge symmetries in the Standard model, used to describe three of the fundamental interactions, are based on the SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) group. (Roughly speaking, the symmetries of the SU(3) group describe the strong force, the SU(2) group describes the weak interaction and the U(1) group describes the electromagnetic force.)\\nAlso, the reduction by symmetry of the energy functional under the action by a group and spontaneous symmetry breaking of transformations of symmetric groups appear to elucidate topics in particle physics (for example, the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force in physical cosmology).\\nConservation laws and symmetry\\nThe symmetry properties of a physical system are intimately related to the conservation laws characterizing that system. Noether\\'s theorem gives a precise description of this relation. The theorem states that each continuous symmetry of a physical system implies that some physical property of that system is conserved. Conversely, each conserved quantity has a corresponding symmetry. For example, the isometry of space gives rise to conservation of (linear) momentum, and isometry of time gives rise to conservation of energy.\\nThe following table summarizes some fundamental symmetries and the associated conserved quantity.\\n|translation in time\\n|translation in space\\n|rotation in space\\n|Discrete symmetry||P, coordinate inversion||spatial parity|\\n|C, charge conjugation||charge parity|\\n|T, time reversal||time parity|\\n|CPT||product of parities|\\n|Internal symmetry (independent of\\n|U(1) gauge transformation||electric charge|\\n|U(1) gauge transformation||lepton generation number|\\n|U(1) gauge transformation||hypercharge|\\n|U(1)Y gauge transformation||weak hypercharge|\\n|U(2) [ U(1) \u00d7 SU(2) ]||electroweak force|\\n|SU(2) gauge transformation||isospin|\\n|SU(2)L gauge transformation||weak isospin|\\n|P \u00d7 SU(2)||G-parity|\\n|SU(3) \"winding number\"||baryon number|\\n|SU(3) gauge transformation||quark color|\\n|SU(3) (approximate)||quark flavor|\\n|S(U(2) \u00d7 U(3))\\n[ U(1) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(3) ]\\nContinuous symmetries in physics preserve transformations. One can specify a symmetry by showing how a very small transformation affects various particle fields. The commutator of two of these infinitesimal transformations are equivalent to a third infinitesimal transformation of the same kind hence they form a Lie algebra.\\nfor a general field, . Without gravity only the Poincar\u00e9 symmetries are preserved which restricts to be of the form:\\nwhere M is an antisymmetric matrix (giving the Lorentz and rotational symmetries) and P is a general vector (giving the translational symmetries). Other symmetries affect multiple fields simultaneously. For example, local gauge transformations apply to both a vector and spinor field:\\nwhere are generators of a particular Lie group. So far the transformations on the right have only included fields of the same type. Supersymmetries are defined according to how the mix fields of different types.\\nAnother symmetry which is part of some theories of physics and not in others is scale invariance which involve Weyl transformations of the following kind:\\nIf the fields have this symmetry then it can be shown that the field theory is almost certainly conformally invariant also. This means that in the absence of gravity h(x) would restricted to the form:\\nwith D generating scale transformations and K generating special conformal transformations. For example, N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory has this symmetry while General Relativity doesn\\'t although other theories of gravity such as conformal gravity do. The \\'action\\' of a field theory is an invariant under all the symmetries of the theory. Much of modern theoretical physics is to do with speculating on the various symmetries the Universe may have and finding the invariants to construct field theories as models.\\nIn string theories, since a string can be decomposed into an infinite number of particle fields, the symmetries on the string world sheet is equivalent to special transformations which mix an infinite number of fields.\\n- Conservation law\\n- Conserved current\\n- Covariance and contravariance\\n- Fictitious force\\n- Galilean invariance\\n- Gauge theory\\n- General covariance\\n- Harmonic coordinate condition\\n- Inertial frame of reference\\n- Lie group\\n- List of mathematical topics in relativity\\n- Lorentz covariance\\n- Noether\\'s theorem\\n- Poincar\u00e9 group\\n- Special relativity\\n- Spontaneous symmetry breaking\\n- Standard model\\n- Standard model (mathematical formulation)\\n- Symmetry breaking\\n- Wheeler\u2013Feynman Time-Symmetric Theory\\n- Dr Zarkali- Atomic Ga lory -New York\\n- G.
