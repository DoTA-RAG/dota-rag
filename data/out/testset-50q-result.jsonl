These pieces are considered the most involving works of art, with larger Unikat items requiring several hours of very careful work to complete.","answer":"A Polish pottery piece marked as \"Unikat\" (Signature) is distinguished from regular pieces by its high level of craftsmanship and unique artistic touch. The term \"Unikat\" means 'unique' in Polish, highlighting that these items have been individually hand-painted using both sponges and brushes. This meticulous hand-painting process is what makes each Unikat piece a unique work of art, as opposed to mass-produced items which may have more uniform decorations.\n\nThe Unikat designation signifies that the pottery piece has been painted by an artist who has personally signed it, adding a layer of authenticity and artistry. This process involves careful application of colors and patterns, often requiring hours of work to complete. Larger Unikat items, due to their intricate design and hand-painted nature, are particularly noted for their complexity and the level of skill required to create them.\n\nIn comparison, regular Polish pottery pieces, while still beautiful and hand-decorated, may employ more consistent patterns and less individual artistic interpretation. These pieces are also hand-painted but might not feature the same level of unique artistic detail as Unikat items. The Unikat pieces are thus highly prized by collectors for their uniqueness, artistry, and the individual story each artist's signature conveys.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nWhat is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:97f8451b-bf37-41bf-8ee0-54bb5d7594a9>"]},{"passage":"What is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces.

Polish pottery has been popping up all over the United States in recent years. It’s been featured in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens. You can find pieces in stores and online. But if you’ve never seen it before, you might be wondering just what exactly is so great about it. So here are 5 great reasons to check out polish pottery for yourself. 1) Polish Pottery is handmade. Polish Pottery is made by hand out of white clay found in Boleslawiec, Poland. The patterns are all hand stamped and\/or hand designed by local artists. This means that each piece is slightly different, which adds to the charm of the pottery. 2) There’s something for everyone. There are hundreds of patterns available in Polish Pottery.

It is the most classic of summer vacations, especially for families, who follow typically flat and easy-to-drive I-90 for a taste of the Wild West. They encounter Shady Brady hats and jackalopes (rabbits with antlers, stuffed) at Wall Drug Store en route, then Black Hills Gold and red clay pottery, working cowboys and roaming buffalo. This is timeless Americana, but it took until this year for me to make the trek. I didn’t try to over-analyze the destination ahead of time, but simply presumed it would be wholesome, tame and predictable. Getting misty-eyed at the sight of Mount Rushmore and feeling awestruck while watching work on the Crazy Horse Memorial never occurred to me. But that is what happened. This is our land of the free, home of the brave, place where the independent spirit seeks and sets seemingly impossible goals. Not much lasts forever, but these two iconic sculptures feel like exceptions. What a legacy for their creators, which include Donald “Nick” Clifford, one of the last guys alive who helped carve Mount Rushmore. He turns 87 on July 5 and began climbing the mountain for pay at age 17, during the Great Depression. “Back in those days, we were glad to have a job,” Nick says, and he didn’t care whether neighbors classified the mission as foolhardy. Nick – who grew up four curvy, uphill miles from his job – had worked in quartz mines before helping to drill, winch and sandblast a quartet of presidential faces into the mountaintop. This was his job for three years; about 400 men made this their occupation during the 14 years of Mount Rushmore construction. “It makes me proud to be an American, to have worked on something like this,” Nick says. He also played baseball “every day, rain or shine,” as a part of the Mount Rushmore team, which won consecutive-year state championships. Nick was a pitcher and outfielder; for sale are baseballs and books autographed by him. At the Crazy Horse site, 17 miles southwest, no one predicts when work will finish. The massive undertaking (all of Mount Rushmore would fit into the head of nine-story-tall Crazy Horse) began 60 years ago, on July 3, when the first dynamite blast tore off 10 tons of rock. Now the granite rubble exceeds 8 million tons. The face of the revered Indian warrior was unveiled in 1998; he was a Lakota, but this sculpture pays tribute to all tribes. The work began because of Korczak Ziolkowski, the monument’s designer and sole laborer, for a while. He died in 1982. The sculptor began this project at midlife, at the request of a Lakota chief. The work continues because of tour proceeds, private donations and the enthusiasm of the sculptor’s widow, Ruth, who still lives in the mountainside log home that her husband built in the 1940s. “If you love your job, it doesn’t seem like work,” the 81-year-old woman insists. “You are happy and grateful to begin each new day.”\nSeven of the couple’s 10 children also are involved with the project, which Ruth considers “storytelling in stone,” on what others describe as sacred ground. People make a mark on this planet in all kinds of ways. Not living to see the full impact of your thumbprint is irrelevant, when the dream and impulse are intense enough. These two colossal monuments – stellar symbols of independence, character and hope – are one way to define freedom as another Fourth of July approaches. You’ll also find mettle in South Dakota. Consider Sequoia Crosswhite, whose attire, dancing, handmade flutes and musical recordings uphold the traditions and history of his Lakota ancestors. We heard his lilting melodies at Prairie Edge, a spacious and two-story gallery of Native American art\/crafts in Rapid City. Head to Myspace.com to see the musician uphold his roots in another way, through a fusion of hip-rock, rock and lyrics about Indian heritage. “It is up to my generation” to make sure cultural legacies are not abandoned, he says.\n\nThe collection of my grandfather’s photographs that I’ve had the chance to replicate continues this week with a shot of the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you’ll continue to follow and support the project! Don’t miss any future Vintage America posts, subscribe for email updates!\n\nIn front of the monument is the avenue of floats which shows when each state joined the union. In the visitors centre they had an exhibition on the sculptor and the creation.It truly was a fantastic place to see! I feel so lucky that we got to see it too! We drove the short distance from Mount Rushmore to Crazy Horse Memorial, which is a bit different as it’s a memorial not yet completed. The Crazy Horse Memorial, is a tribute to the Lakota leader, Crazy Horse. He was a warrior and an instrumental part in the battle of Little Bighorn. He was killed in 1877 in Nebraska. He was only in his thirties. On September 6th every year, a night last at the memorial is held to honour Crazy Horse’s short but legendary life as well as the birth of the sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski. Ziolkowski was invited by Lakota Chief Henry Standing Beat to carve the sculpture of Crazy Horse. It stands to honour the culture and heritage of all North American Indians. Ziolkowski was unsure to begin with as he didn’t think Crazy Horse had necessarily done anything to perhaps warrant a memoria but it turns out it was to be more of a memorial to his spirit. His left hand would be pointed forward because he was asked by a white man once, “Where are your lands now?” Crazy Horse replied, “My lands are where my dead lie buried.” The Native Indians, had their own customs and way of living which was taken away from them after the battle of Little Bighorn. Ziolkowski maintened the idea that the memorial and foundation should be solely privately funded and nothing taken from the government. To this day it remains privately funded from tourists flocking to the visitors centre and surrounding areas. It also remained a family affair with Ziolkowski’s wife Ruth and ten children either working in the mountain , serving in the board or running the gift shop and visitors centre. They showed a video about this which was really quite moving! Ruth passed in 2014 but the children continue to work there!From here it was on to Jewel Cave National Monument. There is so much to see and do in South Dakota! Our passes didn’t get us entry on to the tour here but that didn’t matter as we were excited to see another cave. Jewel Cave isn’t as long as Mammoth Cave and comes in at 189 miles and still exploring! Everywhere we have visited so far today sits in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Jewel cave was established as a national monument in 1908. Ranger Gregory asked “who by?” To which I replied Roosevelt, citing that it was the President, Theodore Roosevelt who designated it. I then got called a brown nose for the trip because I answered the “rhetorical question.” Or I have just paid attention to everywhere we have been…😂\nWe descended an elevator (yes an elevator in an old cave) to 240ft below the surface.The cave only had a mile explored when it became a national monument in 1908 and it wasn’t until the 1960s when Herb and Jan Conn spent 21 years leading caving trips and mapping 65 miles of the cave. Since then it has been explored to 189 miles with no sign of stopping! The map of the cave shows different levels depending on colour and each room and place that has been uncovered has been named. It’s a first come first name basis so whoever finds it, names it. There are some interesting names such as, the ‘big duh’ for the biggest room in the cave so far, ‘the good the bad and the ugly,’ ‘no way through,’ amongst others. The whole bits in the photo are calcite crystal.Huge flowstone above\nJewel cave is named for its jewel-like calcite crystals surrounding the passageways. The cave consists of stalactites, soda straws (not to be drunk from), flowstone and pillars. It is one of the worlds largest caves and probably only had 3-5% of it mapped, so it’s gonna be huge!Anyone for Cave bacon for breakfast? Might hurt your teeth and taste like dirt? Another fascinating formation from deep below our surface! As I was listening to our guide, Ranger Gregory, I was feeling more and more compelled to sign up to become a cave explorer! I mean it literally does sound incredibly fun and satisfying! Then he said that it could take 7-8 hours to get to the camp within the cave and then another three hours to the edge of the cave.\n\nThe easiest way to visit the Crazy Horse Memorial is to fly to Sioux City, South Dakota, and rent a car. There are plenty of moderately priced hotels in the town of Custer. It’s worth spending several days exploring the Black Hills, which have a haunting beauty (they are the oldest mountains in North America). www.crazyhorse.org www.southdakotahotels.org\nIt’s a blast: Explosions carve the features of Lakota warrior Crazy Horse\n\nLast Thursday I flew out to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I know what you're thinking, South Dakota? ABRAMS flew myself and Jason Wells out there on a top secret mission. But of course its a secret one that I will reveal on Monday. But in the mean time here are a bunch of photos from my South Dakota adventure\nAfter breakfast we were ready completed our mission. Here is a sneak peak. Then we hit the road to see what South Dakota had to offer.S. Dakota offered a 75 mph state highway. At times I was going a tad fast ( 100 mph ) as we drove across the state with Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills in our site. Just down the road from Mount Rushmore is the Crazy Horse Memorial\nThe mountain carving was begun in 1948 by a Polish American sculptor Korczak Ziółkowski, who had worked on Mount Rushmore under Gutzon Borglum in 1924. This is what Crazy Horse will look like when finished\nThey have a long way to go.\n\nLastly, if your drone has an electronic camera and also can taking pictures or videos, after that you need to have consent from the appropriate authorities to take a picture or a video, or else it is unlawful to do so.

Lots of tips discussed are actually legislations to safeguard individuals around you and also even yourself, and also they differ depending upon where you are.

A photo flight is a flight in a helicopter or airplane with a photographer on board, taking pictures of properties, events, construction sites or other projects. So why not just use a drone? That seems to be just so much easier, right? Well, a drone is very lightweight, and can stay in the air only for a limited amount of time. Winds can be challenging for a drone because of its weight. There are also restrictions on what you can do with a drone. You cannot operate above a certain altitude without FAA approval, and you cannot operate close to certain airports. A helicopter or airplane is able to stay in the air for hours, if needed. An aircraft can cover a way bigger area and give the photographer better flexibility. There are specific applications where a drone makes way more sense than a helicopter or airplane. Especially if you are operating close to the ground. So both have their advantages and disadvantages. How does a photo flight typically work? We typically start with a ground briefing with the photographer and the pilot. This is to make sure both know exactly what is expected and what is of importance to the photographer or camera man and the project. This is of even more importance if a video or movie is shot. It will help keep the cost down, since we want to keep the time that we are in the helicopter actually flying as focused and short as possible. Also important is the safety briefing. No loose objects in the aircraft. We try to fulfill the needs of the photographer but it is of the highest importance that the flight is safe. What projects have we done in the past? We have worked on film and photo projects including Music Videos, Vehicle promotion videos and lots of photography projects. Some of those include Vineyards, buildings, marathons, crop fields, construction sites and more. If you have any questions or need details on how we can help you with a certain project, please don’t hesitate to contact us.\n\nPost new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india? There are guidelines to use the Drone more than like 2Km , 5Km range as we used small drones for capturing pictures from around 200m ..400m so you can use with the normal permissions. Yes Local police or forest dept for some trek . Normal permission means the local police or the local tourism incharge? The one with higher frequency radius sure needs permission which is quite impossible to get.

To this day it remains privately funded from tourists flocking to the visitors centre and surrounding areas. It also remained a family affair with Ziolkowski’s wife Ruth and ten children either working in the mountain , serving in the board or running the gift shop and visitors centre. They showed a video about this which was really quite moving! Ruth passed in 2014 but the children continue to work there!From here it was on to Jewel Cave National Monument. There is so much to see and do in South Dakota! Our passes didn’t get us entry on to the tour here but that didn’t matter as we were excited to see another cave. Jewel Cave isn’t as long as Mammoth Cave and comes in at 189 miles and still exploring! Everywhere we have visited so far today sits in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Jewel cave was established as a national monument in 1908. Ranger Gregory asked “who by?” To which I replied Roosevelt, citing that it was the President, Theodore Roosevelt who designated it. I then got called a brown nose for the trip because I answered the “rhetorical question.” Or I have just paid attention to everywhere we have been…😂\nWe descended an elevator (yes an elevator in an old cave) to 240ft below the surface.The cave only had a mile explored when it became a national monument in 1908 and it wasn’t until the 1960s when Herb and Jan Conn spent 21 years leading caving trips and mapping 65 miles of the cave. Since then it has been explored to 189 miles with no sign of stopping! The map of the cave shows different levels depending on colour and each room and place that has been uncovered has been named. It’s a first come first name basis so whoever finds it, names it. There are some interesting names such as, the ‘big duh’ for the biggest room in the cave so far, ‘the good the bad and the ugly,’ ‘no way through,’ amongst others. The whole bits in the photo are calcite crystal.Huge flowstone above\nJewel cave is named for its jewel-like calcite crystals surrounding the passageways. The cave consists of stalactites, soda straws (not to be drunk from), flowstone and pillars. It is one of the worlds largest caves and probably only had 3-5% of it mapped, so it’s gonna be huge!Anyone for Cave bacon for breakfast? Might hurt your teeth and taste like dirt? Another fascinating formation from deep below our surface! As I was listening to our guide, Ranger Gregory, I was feeling more and more compelled to sign up to become a cave explorer! I mean it literally does sound incredibly fun and satisfying! Then he said that it could take 7-8 hours to get to the camp within the cave and then another three hours to the edge of the cave.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0d018dc4-969a-47e2-80a8-633fd4e42415>"]},{"passage":"The easiest way to visit the Crazy Horse Memorial is to fly to Sioux City, South Dakota, and rent a car.

A photo flight is a flight in a helicopter or airplane with a photographer on board, taking pictures of properties, events, construction sites or other projects. So why not just use a drone? That seems to be just so much easier, right? Well, a drone is very lightweight, and can stay in the air only for a limited amount of time. Winds can be challenging for a drone because of its weight. There are also restrictions on what you can do with a drone. You cannot operate above a certain altitude without FAA approval, and you cannot operate close to certain airports. A helicopter or airplane is able to stay in the air for hours, if needed. An aircraft can cover a way bigger area and give the photographer better flexibility. There are specific applications where a drone makes way more sense than a helicopter or airplane. Especially if you are operating close to the ground. So both have their advantages and disadvantages. How does a photo flight typically work? We typically start with a ground briefing with the photographer and the pilot. This is to make sure both know exactly what is expected and what is of importance to the photographer or camera man and the project. This is of even more importance if a video or movie is shot. It will help keep the cost down, since we want to keep the time that we are in the helicopter actually flying as focused and short as possible. Also important is the safety briefing. No loose objects in the aircraft. We try to fulfill the needs of the photographer but it is of the highest importance that the flight is safe. What projects have we done in the past? We have worked on film and photo projects including Music Videos, Vehicle promotion videos and lots of photography projects. Some of those include Vineyards, buildings, marathons, crop fields, construction sites and more. If you have any questions or need details on how we can help you with a certain project, please don’t hesitate to contact us.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1b07a219-3f2e-423f-b97a-29f0b385e4b4>"]},{"passage":"Post new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india?

The area is home to numerous murals and one of the oldest missions in California. Visitors and locals enjoy spending time in Dolores Park with views of the city and bay. Many pack a picnic lunch or dinner and wine. There are several Mission District bars to stop at while exploring the neighborhood. If a person is looking for a little history to go along with a drink, Shotwell’s has it. This bar first opened its doors in 1891. The bullet holes in the bar panels and the name of the bar are terrific conversation starters. Shotwell’s doesn’t serve food, but the bar does have select craft beers from which to choose. The drink menu also includes wine and cider. If a local happens to be walking their dog through the neighborhood and has a hankering for a drink, have to fear, dogs are welcome at Shotwell’s. This Mission District bar is a dream come true for Cleveland Browns fans. On game days, the bar turns into, what they call, the kennel. Of course, any type of fans or even those that don’t like sports are welcome at any time. Kilowatt has 21 tap beers and a selection of over 20 bottled brands. If customers aren’t interested in the sports on the multiple televisions, they can partake in playing darts or pool. The bar has a daily happy hour and a special on the beer of the month. The Trick Dog is probably one of the Mission District’s most eclectic bars. The bar has won several awards and is noticed for its biannual changing menu. The menu might have rhyming names of cocktails that are based on Dr. Seuss stories or exotic names of dogs. The bar offers neighborhood bar food on its menu, including its chicken Tricknuggets and the bologna sandwich, but it also has other choices, such as soba noodle salad and beef tartare. The venue is available for private parties and offers the main bar, The mezzanine room, which is a very intimate setting, and the upstairs room, which gives guests access to AV connections and Wi-Fi. This bar is an interesting Mission District hangout. Dalva serves its customers beer, wine and a variety of cocktails. During the daily happy hour, the space can get crowded. For those that are looking for a quieter place to converse, and indulge in more potent cocktails, the Hideout is a bar within the bar. The Hideout is located in the lower level of Dalva and the bartenders are ready to make experimental cocktails at the customer’s request.\n\nIt was easily one of the best risottos I have ever had. Even my brother- a bit of the carnivore- ordered it over the steak. The entrees came and were devoured before the cameras made it out, so unfortunately no photos of those dishes. Next stop was a highlight of the trip, not just because of the deliciousness of the drinks, but because they really nailed it with ambiance and customer service. My brother had made us reservations at The Velvet Tango Room, a famous speakeasy, and we spent a few evening hours on their patio. If you go to Cleveland, reservations are a must here because that is the way you get access to their private little area in the back which has intimate sitting areas and a putting green- yes, a putting green! The servers and bartenders here are passionate about their craft. They are cocktail nerds who are more than willing and able to tell you about each an every cocktail on their extensive menu. The drinks have bewildering little names and curious stories associated with them, and many of them are made with house-made bitters, syrups, tonics. Expect the real deal here. The first drink I ordered, the Royal Fizz, had a whole egg- white AND yolk- and a hint of vanilla. For the next drink, I enlisted the waitress's help because I was overwhelmed with indecision. After a series of crazy questions, one of which included \"Would I prefer a convertible or a sedan?\" or something along those lines, the server disappeared promising the perfect fit, and I ended up with a Martinez- essentially a gin-vermouth number that was really delicious and powerful. We all agreed a late night bite was in order, so we stopped by their apartment to pick up their adorable German Shepherd, Ember, and headed to the local late-night pizza place, Edison's. It is a far cry from the gourmet wood-fried thin-crust pizza bistro and wine bar that you would probably venture to for dinner or a date night. It is more like dive bar meets Pizza Hut, and it fills that craving for doughy, cheesy pizza. Just check out their Yelp page. And it is dog-friendly which is even more awesome. We stayed a while and with full bellies, eventually made it back to the apartment and crawled into bed. Needless to say, Sunday started off a bit late. We packed up, grabbed food at their favorite local Vietnamese spot, Pho Thang Cafe, and ventured to see their beautiful wedding venue. They are getting married next May at a gorgeous spot on Lake Erie, and we cannot wait to celebrate with them there. We hit the road back to Philadelphia and back to reality. I wish our visit could have been longer, but now we have an excuse to go back! We also have to check out Cleveland's amazing museums, maybe catch a Cav's basketball game, and of course check out more of their restaurant scene. The Cleveland people really are stellar, and I now understand why my brother loves it so much. Good people and good food- what more could you ask for?\n\nThis is Spilling the Beans, where plugged-in baristas give us the lowdown on where to go, what to do, and what to eat (and drink) in their hometown. \"People ask me why I left Portland, and I tell them that Cleveland now is very similar to what Portland was 15 years ago,\" said Robert Stockham, general manager at the city's premiere coffee roaster, Rising Star. Except Cleveland is a city with its own swagger, and a cost of living so low that Stockham said, \"You can buy a house for less than a car, and you should never pay full retail price for anything here.\" Also: Cleveland is the place for a hipster hotdog hangout that puts Froot Loops on its dogs, a brewery that has residents lining up for Christmas-spiced beer, and one of the world's best symphony orchestras. Come hungry, and let Stockham be your guide. Where should we stay? If you stay downtown, you can't go wrong. My favorite is Wallace Manor Bed and Breakfast in Ohio City; it’s a beautiful old, Victorian-era building that was recently renovated. The owners are super friendly and take care of people really well. We also have a Westin downtown that’s attached to Urban Farmer, a steakhouse that sources what it can locally. Other hotels to consider: the Metropolitan at the Nine, a luxury hotel-condo-restaurant complex, which is new, and a big deal for Cleveland; the new Hilton; and the Drury Hotel, because it’s in a converted school district administration building and is all marble. Where should we grab breakfast? Urban Farmer has a great brunch. But the real place to go is Jack Flaps. Their pancakes are freaking amazing. Everyone raves about a short stack of the lemon curd pancakes, but I love the Benedicto Mexicano, which has cornbread, chorizo, gravy, crema, and sunny side up eggs. Best cup of coffee? Rising Star, of course. Then Six Shooter Coffee, a local roaster, is in the Waterloo neighborhood nearest the best wood-fired pizza in town, Citizen Pie. Pour Cleveland is a multi-roaster. Vintage Tea and Coffee is also good. Best place to see great art? The Cleveland Museum of Art is nothing short of amazing. Not only is it one of the few free museums remaining in the country, but it has Rodin’s Thinker and one of Monet’s water lilies. Nobody talks about how unbelievable it is. Also, the covered atrium there is one of the most beautiful places in town. Best market to eat your way around? West Side Market. It celebrated its 100 year anniversary a few years ago. There are fish, meat, spice, and produce vendors. If you want spices, try Urban Herbs. Then try Rooted in Cleveland for local produce and pour-over coffee. The other two I love are the crepe stand and also a fishmonger called Kate’s Fish, which is notable because we're not near water and the fish they sell is excellent. Best old-school Cleveland restaurant institution? Pier W is the old standby with the best seafood in all of Northeast Ohio; it overlooks the lake. The other one would be Johnny’s, a downtown fancy steakhouse restaurant that’s been there for several decades. But the Cleveland institution everyone raves about is Sokolowski’s. We have a large Eastern European population here, and this is THE place to get pierogies, cabbage, and the like. Hottest new restaurant in town? First, Mabel’s BBQ. It’s a Michael Symon project that’s reimagining Cleveland-style barbecue. Then there’s The Proper Pig. The Southern Café serves awesome Southern food. Also, I’m most excited about The Arcadian, which is trying to get as close to farm to table as it possibly can. On the more upscale end, there’s a French restaurant called L’Albatros that is absolutely to die for. I also should mention Happy Dog in Gordon Square. It’s a hipster hot dog hangout that serves great beer and a hot dog menu with wacky toppings like Sriracha, Froot Loops, and peanut butter. Which restaurants do you frequent? Superior Pho for one serves hands down the best pho in town. Then Caribe Bake Shop, which is a Latin American food restaurant that isn’t exactly a bakery the way its name says.\n\nThere are empanadas, pintxos, shredded pork, shredded chicken, and you can mix and match. They make this sausage sweet potato ball surrounded by mushed plantains then deep-fried like a Scotch egg: it’ll knock your socks off. Best cocktails in town? Urban Farmer has one of my favorite bars, and my drink is the Farmer’s Handshake. There’s another place called Society Lounge, which is an old-fashioned speakeasy that really feels like stepping back in time. But The Spotted Owl is the local favorite. They hand-make their own ice and source very specific ingredients to create cocktails as true artists. The best drink I had there was called the Pampelmousse, and it had mescal, champagne, and grapefruit sherbet. Best brewery to hang out at? Market Garden Brewery, which has about 10 to 15 beers brewed in house in their tap room at all times. Many of those use Cleveland-based ingredients. Then there’s Nano Brew. Both are part of the Sam McNulty group, which is opening a “palace to fermentation,” a new brewery space that will brew and bottle. The third is Great Lakes Brewing, which has a more upscale menu, but is best known for its Christmas Ale. It’s dark brown and rich, with notes of coriander, cloves, cinnamon, and a head that makes you want to lap it up. It’s in limited supply and people line up on the day of release to get their hands on it. Best place to see live music? One of the best venues is the House of Blues, which has three stages and welcomes big and small acts. Then The World Famous Agora is quite popular for lesser known bands. Happy Dog is too. But if you’re coming to town, sign up for Sofar Sounds, or Sounds from a Room. They do pop-up concerts in weird venues, and only tell you where the concert will be about a day before. Locations have included weaving factories, secret parks, blocked-off courtyards—anywhere. There’s no entry fee and it’s BYOB. We also have one of the top symphonies in the entire world. Seeing a concert at Severance Hall is also worth it for the art deco architecture alone. Best place to get into trouble for the night? Start on 4th Street to get some food to coat your stomach. Then, if you want fun, loud, and obnoxious, go to the Warehouse District on West 6th. That’s where you’ll find a college to younger 30s crowd and bars with loud music, dancing, and lots of alcohol. Then I would go down to the Flats, which was recently rebuilt to be a walkable summer neighborhoods with great restaurants and bars. If you’re a beer drinker, try Beer Head down there. I’d also recommend Punch Bowl Social, because it serves giant boozy punch bowls. Another standalone place that’s a blast is the Porco Lounge and Tiki Room. It’s nowhere near anything else, but it serves the best Polynesian-inspired cocktails in Ohio. Where to eat when the party’s over? There are two places that are always packed after the bars close. My Friends Restaurant at the edge of Cleveland, which is kind of like Denny’s and serves omelets and burgers, is busier late at night than at any other time. Then you have The Big Egg, another IHOP-y place everyone ends up. Go to wine country. If you’re like, “Ohio has wine country?” Yes, we do, and there are some surprisingly amazing wineries. My favorites are Saint Joseph and M Cellars. You’re also about an hour away from Amish country; Sugarcreek is worth a visit.\n\nMankind’s infatuation with canine companionship is nothing new. In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.\n\nDogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?\n\nA Wild Night in Downtown Cleveland\nToday’s entry is a guest post from my wife Tiffany. On a balmy 32-degree December evening, my brother John and I headed downtown to meet up with Steve and a few friends (shout out to Turk, Nate and Megan) to celebrate his new job. I would have gone with my husband, but he ditched me to go to the Cavs game with his sister Julie. (Okay, so I begged him to take Julie to the game.) John and I found a parking spot in a deck near Euclid for TWENTY dollars. Cash only. I lived in Boston, New York and Los angles and never paid TWENTY dollars for parking. I’m a big fan of Cleveland, but come on. Parking should be no more than a couple bucks, if not free. Make it easy for people to come downtown! We decided to stop at Butcher and the Brewer for a bite. Even though the hostess quoted us a 45-minute wait, we snagged the vacant bar stools along the front window. Best seats in the house, in my opinion. Great people watching and good service. As for the food, I have three words for you: fancy corn dogs. Heck, I love the frozen kind, so I was floored when we were served cake pop style yummy corn dogs with fancy mustard that I couldn’t eat because it was infused with beer. Oh yeah, I don’t drink, so I won’t be commenting on any of their specialty cocktails. My club soda with no ice and a wedge of lemon was spot on, though. After dinner, we met up with our group at Lake Effects pop-up holiday bar in The Schofield Building. Every sober person’s dream: a Friday night at a Christmas bar in downtown Cleveland. As a former professional drinker, this had amateur hour written all over it. Not long after we walked in, I had to hit the little girls room. Of course the line was eons long, so I opted to sneak over to the hotel lobby and use their much larger facilities. Another reveler, decked out in her best ugly, but trying to be cute, Christmas sweater led the way … sort of. She was unusually hammered for so early in the evening, but a hoot nonetheless. After pushing the wrong side of the door several times, she was so thrilled to finally get it open that she threw her arm around me and jubilantly celebrated the half block to the hotel lobby, remarking over and over how ‘we’ couldn’t get the door open, but finally did. With no way to ditch my new best friend as we approached the quiet and civilized lobby, I muttered a few ‘be cool’s,’ which she repeated back to me in her best whisper slur. Once in the stall (separate, thank God), I fulfilled my bathroom duties with the sheer determination to escape before she could flush her toilet. I quickly scurried down the block hoping upon hope she was too far behind to see me. One might think that was the highlight of the evening. Well, my friends, you’d be wrong. Back in the sauna-like bar, we set up shop in a corner fit with a small couch and chairs. We had just settled in for our long winter’s evening when all of a sudden there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my seat as the contents of a shelf went splatter right where I’d been sitting. Someone had apparently banged into the partition-like wall hard enough to send the decor tumbling. Painted hardcover books, a watering can, and a thick glass Christmas tree remained on the wobbly shelf, so I wisely removed the items before they had their own chance to fall off. Five minutes later, the owner\/manager\/bar-back came guns blazing to our table shouting at me to open my purse and remove the stolen wall decor from my tiny handbag. Clearly misinformed, I did what every mature, sober 40-year-old woman does. I stood up, pointed my finger right at him and yelled “Duck you!” (Damn you, autocorrect). “You’re ducking decorations nearly smashed me on the head.” And then I proceeded to repeat the first statement a few more times before he cowered away from our table, shaking the guys’ hands and apologizing for the accusation.\n\nFor dog lovers, leaving their beloved dog for a period of time while on vacation is usually heart-wrenching. Bringing your pets on trips can be hassling at times, especially when the destinations you're bound to visit are not pet-friendly. But good news! There are actually a lot of dog-friendly places in the U.S. that you and your best pal can spend time in. Here are some of the best places you and your pup can go to for an unforgettable bonding time:\nAustin, Texas. Austin is one of the best places to bond in for you and your furry pal. The place is teeming with lots of fun activities and entertainment, such as cheap festivals and concerts where dogs are allowed. According to Trips to Discover, Barton Creek Greenbelt and Zilker Metropolitan Park are also great places to play with your pet, and there's the Groovy Dog Bakery to buy your pet some treats. Carmel by the Sea, California. This seaside village is rated one of the best dog-friendly towns in the whole country, and it can't be doubted when the 25 hotels, inns, 44 restaurants, bars and coffee houses found in the village are all pooch-friendly. Tons of exclusive doggie services can be enjoyed here. Make sure to include a trip to Carmel Beach. According to Fodors, it's one of the state's few remaining off-leash beaches. Colorado Springs, Colorado. Embark on an adventure with your dog and take him\/her with you on fun camping and hiking trails in Colorado Springs. Soak all the fresh mountain air and beautiful sceneries with your pup for a more intense bond. Some dog-friendly trails include the South Boulder Peak Trail, the Flatirons Vista Loop, and the Royal Arch Trail. Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville isn't just the music capital of the country, it may well be the friendliest city for pooches also. More than 50 hotels in the city welcome pooches in their midst, and there are other 75 dog-friendly establishments waiting for your pet. Let your dog meet new friends at the Centennial Dog Park, or experience the Trails at Fontanel.\n\nSome of the guys who show up for happy hour at the Bark Bar don't bother with formalities when they spot a female. They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!\" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. \"Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.\"\n\nHotels are expanding their luxury services for animals to ensure that your beloved canine companion can sleep and dine in style. An increasing number of upscale lodging establishments gain guest loyalty by throwing a bone to Bob. “Oh, yes. Bob,” said Sue, who with her husband, Derrick, was telling a story to another couple. Barely within earshot, I heard them continue. “Well, he needs plenty of room or he gets cranky,” she said. “It’s important that he be able to stretch his legs. He doesn’t like to be cramped,” said Derrick. “And he’s a finicky eater … and frankly, he doesn’t get along well with others.”\nAn aging uncle? A distant cousin? No. Bob is their beloved greyhound dog. And there’s nothing too good for Bob. My friends Sue and Derrick don’t go anywhere without Bob. Hotels, restaurants, parties, resorts. If Bob isn’t welcome, they simply don’t go. Fortunately, for this Arizona couple, much of the world now sees it their way. It’s a Dog’s World\nAn increasing number of lodging establishments are not only posting a welcome sign for your pooches, but they are going out of their way to ensure your pet is comfortable and cozy. Upscale hotel chains like Loews Hotels and Starwood’s W Hotels, have expanded their system-wide commitments to include guests’ canine companions. With perks ranging from toys at check-in to doggie turndown service, pets have plenty to wag their tails about. So when you get the urge to enjoy life’s luxurious locations, you won’t have to go alone. Here are a few of the places where your four-legged friends will be appreciated. My son Ted and I recently spent the night at The Curtis hotel in downtown Denver. A pop culture hotspot, The Curtis features colorful themed rooms and floors, which are all about fun. And if the humans are having a good time, why not include the shaggy set and let the good times roll. The hotel has installed the city’s largest doggie door, allowing pets like Bob and his pals to slip into the lobby in style. He’ll bunk on the “pet-friendly” 8th floor—which is Sci-Fi themed, where images from Star Wars, Alien, Godzilla and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman adorn the halls. www.thecurtis.com\nIn sunny Los Angeles, The Beverly Hills Hotel, offers a Canine Connoisseur program, with bone-shaped cookies personalized by hand with your pet’s name, as well as doggie beds, bowls and the hotel’s signature hot pink tennis balls. Rooms start at $495 per night. www.thebeverlyhillshotel.com\nAfter a long day of shopping in fashionable Milan, you’ll have no worries. The Hotel Principe di Savoia has a room service menu just for pets featuring tasty treats made out of beef, chicken or veal, served cooked to order or tartar. The hotel also offers vegetable croquettes. (Of course, there is room service for you as well.) . www.hotelprincipedisavoia.com\nHeaded to Paris with your puppy? The elegant Hotel Le Meurice offers complimentary pet baskets for dogs (and cats), with personalized and custom-designed bowls and name tags, and specific menus and food options—all arranged prior to your arrival. The hotel’s staff members will also be pleased to take your dog for a stroll in the Jardin des Tuileries while you are out and about the streets of Paris. www.lemeurice.com\nAt the Long Beach Lodge on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, pets are welcomed into beach-front guest rooms or rain-forest cottages. And when those paws get wet and sandy from a feisty romp on the world famous surfing beach, there will be warm towels, special treats and a cozy bed—size small, medium or large—waiting for your treasured friend in seaside accommodations. “Our guests enjoy staying at the Long Beach Lodge with their dogs and having the opportunity to explore the beaches and nearby trails,” explains Sara Holland, a spokesperson for the resort.\n\nQuestion:I enjoy having drinks with friends but hate leaving my dog at home. Are there any establishments in Cleveland that welcome dogs while serving drinks?","passages":[{"passage":"The Mission District is the oldest neighborhood in the city of San Francisco. The area is home to numerous murals and one of the oldest missions in California. Visitors and locals enjoy spending time in Dolores Park with views of the city and bay. Many pack a picnic lunch or dinner and wine. There are several Mission District bars to stop at while exploring the neighborhood. If a person is looking for a little history to go along with a drink, Shotwell’s has it. This bar first opened its doors in 1891. The bullet holes in the bar panels and the name of the bar are terrific conversation starters. Shotwell’s doesn’t serve food, but the bar does have select craft beers from which to choose. The drink menu also includes wine and cider. If a local happens to be walking their dog through the neighborhood and has a hankering for a drink, have to fear, dogs are welcome at Shotwell’s. This Mission District bar is a dream come true for Cleveland Browns fans. On game days, the bar turns into, what they call, the kennel. Of course, any type of fans or even those that don’t like sports are welcome at any time. Kilowatt has 21 tap beers and a selection of over 20 bottled brands. If customers aren’t interested in the sports on the multiple televisions, they can partake in playing darts or pool. The bar has a daily happy hour and a special on the beer of the month. The Trick Dog is probably one of the Mission District’s most eclectic bars. The bar has won several awards and is noticed for its biannual changing menu. The menu might have rhyming names of cocktails that are based on Dr. Seuss stories or exotic names of dogs. The bar offers neighborhood bar food on its menu, including its chicken Tricknuggets and the bologna sandwich, but it also has other choices, such as soba noodle salad and beef tartare. The venue is available for private parties and offers the main bar, The mezzanine room, which is a very intimate setting, and the upstairs room, which gives guests access to AV connections and Wi-Fi. This bar is an interesting Mission District hangout. Dalva serves its customers beer, wine and a variety of cocktails. During the daily happy hour, the space can get crowded. For those that are looking for a quieter place to converse, and indulge in more potent cocktails, the Hideout is a bar within the bar. The Hideout is located in the lower level of Dalva and the bartenders are ready to make experimental cocktails at the customer’s request.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f3870064-b05b-40ab-a557-be2de0f8a1a3>"]},{"passage":"It was easily one of the best risottos I have ever had. Even my brother- a bit of the carnivore- ordered it over the steak. The entrees came and were devoured before the cameras made it out, so unfortunately no photos of those dishes. Next stop was a highlight of the trip, not just because of the deliciousness of the drinks, but because they really nailed it with ambiance and customer service. My brother had made us reservations at The Velvet Tango Room, a famous speakeasy, and we spent a few evening hours on their patio. If you go to Cleveland, reservations are a must here because that is the way you get access to their private little area in the back which has intimate sitting areas and a putting green- yes, a putting green! The servers and bartenders here are passionate about their craft. They are cocktail nerds who are more than willing and able to tell you about each an every cocktail on their extensive menu. The drinks have bewildering little names and curious stories associated with them, and many of them are made with house-made bitters, syrups, tonics. Expect the real deal here. The first drink I ordered, the Royal Fizz, had a whole egg- white AND yolk- and a hint of vanilla. For the next drink, I enlisted the waitress's help because I was overwhelmed with indecision. After a series of crazy questions, one of which included \"Would I prefer a convertible or a sedan?\" or something along those lines, the server disappeared promising the perfect fit, and I ended up with a Martinez- essentially a gin-vermouth number that was really delicious and powerful. We all agreed a late night bite was in order, so we stopped by their apartment to pick up their adorable German Shepherd, Ember, and headed to the local late-night pizza place, Edison's. It is a far cry from the gourmet wood-fried thin-crust pizza bistro and wine bar that you would probably venture to for dinner or a date night. It is more like dive bar meets Pizza Hut, and it fills that craving for doughy, cheesy pizza. Just check out their Yelp page. And it is dog-friendly which is even more awesome. We stayed a while and with full bellies, eventually made it back to the apartment and crawled into bed. Needless to say, Sunday started off a bit late. We packed up, grabbed food at their favorite local Vietnamese spot, Pho Thang Cafe, and ventured to see their beautiful wedding venue. They are getting married next May at a gorgeous spot on Lake Erie, and we cannot wait to celebrate with them there. We hit the road back to Philadelphia and back to reality. I wish our visit could have been longer, but now we have an excuse to go back! We also have to check out Cleveland's amazing museums, maybe catch a Cav's basketball game, and of course check out more of their restaurant scene. The Cleveland people really are stellar, and I now understand why my brother loves it so much. Good people and good food- what more could you ask for?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:04ac8323-d5ae-4448-ad04-6e78f93bced4>"]},{"passage":"This is Spilling the Beans, where plugged-in baristas give us the lowdown on where to go, what to do, and what to eat (and drink) in their hometown. \"People ask me why I left Portland, and I tell them that Cleveland now is very similar to what Portland was 15 years ago,\" said Robert Stockham, general manager at the city's premiere coffee roaster, Rising Star. Except Cleveland is a city with its own swagger, and a cost of living so low that Stockham said, \"You can buy a house for less than a car, and you should never pay full retail price for anything here.\" Also: Cleveland is the place for a hipster hotdog hangout that puts Froot Loops on its dogs, a brewery that has residents lining up for Christmas-spiced beer, and one of the world's best symphony orchestras. Come hungry, and let Stockham be your guide. Where should we stay? If you stay downtown, you can't go wrong. My favorite is Wallace Manor Bed and Breakfast in Ohio City; it’s a beautiful old, Victorian-era building that was recently renovated. The owners are super friendly and take care of people really well. We also have a Westin downtown that’s attached to Urban Farmer, a steakhouse that sources what it can locally. Other hotels to consider: the Metropolitan at the Nine, a luxury hotel-condo-restaurant complex, which is new, and a big deal for Cleveland; the new Hilton; and the Drury Hotel, because it’s in a converted school district administration building and is all marble. Where should we grab breakfast? Urban Farmer has a great brunch. But the real place to go is Jack Flaps. Their pancakes are freaking amazing. Everyone raves about a short stack of the lemon curd pancakes, but I love the Benedicto Mexicano, which has cornbread, chorizo, gravy, crema, and sunny side up eggs. Best cup of coffee? Rising Star, of course. Then Six Shooter Coffee, a local roaster, is in the Waterloo neighborhood nearest the best wood-fired pizza in town, Citizen Pie. Pour Cleveland is a multi-roaster. Vintage Tea and Coffee is also good. Best place to see great art? The Cleveland Museum of Art is nothing short of amazing. Not only is it one of the few free museums remaining in the country, but it has Rodin’s Thinker and one of Monet’s water lilies. Nobody talks about how unbelievable it is. Also, the covered atrium there is one of the most beautiful places in town. Best market to eat your way around? West Side Market. It celebrated its 100 year anniversary a few years ago. There are fish, meat, spice, and produce vendors. If you want spices, try Urban Herbs. Then try Rooted in Cleveland for local produce and pour-over coffee. The other two I love are the crepe stand and also a fishmonger called Kate’s Fish, which is notable because we're not near water and the fish they sell is excellent. Best old-school Cleveland restaurant institution? Pier W is the old standby with the best seafood in all of Northeast Ohio; it overlooks the lake. The other one would be Johnny’s, a downtown fancy steakhouse restaurant that’s been there for several decades. But the Cleveland institution everyone raves about is Sokolowski’s. We have a large Eastern European population here, and this is THE place to get pierogies, cabbage, and the like. Hottest new restaurant in town? First, Mabel’s BBQ. It’s a Michael Symon project that’s reimagining Cleveland-style barbecue. Then there’s The Proper Pig. The Southern Café serves awesome Southern food. Also, I’m most excited about The Arcadian, which is trying to get as close to farm to table as it possibly can. On the more upscale end, there’s a French restaurant called L’Albatros that is absolutely to die for. I also should mention Happy Dog in Gordon Square. It’s a hipster hot dog hangout that serves great beer and a hot dog menu with wacky toppings like Sriracha, Froot Loops, and peanut butter. Which restaurants do you frequent? Superior Pho for one serves hands down the best pho in town. Then Caribe Bake Shop, which is a Latin American food restaurant that isn’t exactly a bakery the way its name says.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:eb36cdec-a1a2-4939-94f5-6519a6415da1>"]},{"passage":"There are empanadas, pintxos, shredded pork, shredded chicken, and you can mix and match. They make this sausage sweet potato ball surrounded by mushed plantains then deep-fried like a Scotch egg: it’ll knock your socks off. Best cocktails in town? Urban Farmer has one of my favorite bars, and my drink is the Farmer’s Handshake. There’s another place called Society Lounge, which is an old-fashioned speakeasy that really feels like stepping back in time. But The Spotted Owl is the local favorite. They hand-make their own ice and source very specific ingredients to create cocktails as true artists. The best drink I had there was called the Pampelmousse, and it had mescal, champagne, and grapefruit sherbet. Best brewery to hang out at? Market Garden Brewery, which has about 10 to 15 beers brewed in house in their tap room at all times. Many of those use Cleveland-based ingredients. Then there’s Nano Brew. Both are part of the Sam McNulty group, which is opening a “palace to fermentation,” a new brewery space that will brew and bottle. The third is Great Lakes Brewing, which has a more upscale menu, but is best known for its Christmas Ale. It’s dark brown and rich, with notes of coriander, cloves, cinnamon, and a head that makes you want to lap it up. It’s in limited supply and people line up on the day of release to get their hands on it. Best place to see live music? One of the best venues is the House of Blues, which has three stages and welcomes big and small acts. Then The World Famous Agora is quite popular for lesser known bands. Happy Dog is too. But if you’re coming to town, sign up for Sofar Sounds, or Sounds from a Room. They do pop-up concerts in weird venues, and only tell you where the concert will be about a day before. Locations have included weaving factories, secret parks, blocked-off courtyards—anywhere. There’s no entry fee and it’s BYOB. We also have one of the top symphonies in the entire world. Seeing a concert at Severance Hall is also worth it for the art deco architecture alone. Best place to get into trouble for the night? Start on 4th Street to get some food to coat your stomach. Then, if you want fun, loud, and obnoxious, go to the Warehouse District on West 6th. That’s where you’ll find a college to younger 30s crowd and bars with loud music, dancing, and lots of alcohol. Then I would go down to the Flats, which was recently rebuilt to be a walkable summer neighborhoods with great restaurants and bars. If you’re a beer drinker, try Beer Head down there. I’d also recommend Punch Bowl Social, because it serves giant boozy punch bowls. Another standalone place that’s a blast is the Porco Lounge and Tiki Room. It’s nowhere near anything else, but it serves the best Polynesian-inspired cocktails in Ohio. Where to eat when the party’s over? There are two places that are always packed after the bars close. My Friends Restaurant at the edge of Cleveland, which is kind of like Denny’s and serves omelets and burgers, is busier late at night than at any other time. Then you have The Big Egg, another IHOP-y place everyone ends up. Go to wine country. If you’re like, “Ohio has wine country?” Yes, we do, and there are some surprisingly amazing wineries. My favorites are Saint Joseph and M Cellars. You’re also about an hour away from Amish country; Sugarcreek is worth a visit.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:eb36cdec-a1a2-4939-94f5-6519a6415da1>"]},{"passage":"Mankind’s infatuation with canine companionship is nothing new. In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:80965d7e-3492-4c8e-8ef7-ba5d0304e7e0>"]},{"passage":"Dogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2074f70e-250b-4d43-8c63-77d4f989422f>"]},{"passage":"A Wild Night in Downtown Cleveland\nToday’s entry is a guest post from my wife Tiffany. On a balmy 32-degree December evening, my brother John and I headed downtown to meet up with Steve and a few friends (shout out to Turk, Nate and Megan) to celebrate his new job. I would have gone with my husband, but he ditched me to go to the Cavs game with his sister Julie. (Okay, so I begged him to take Julie to the game.) John and I found a parking spot in a deck near Euclid for TWENTY dollars. Cash only. I lived in Boston, New York and Los angles and never paid TWENTY dollars for parking. I’m a big fan of Cleveland, but come on. Parking should be no more than a couple bucks, if not free. Make it easy for people to come downtown! We decided to stop at Butcher and the Brewer for a bite. Even though the hostess quoted us a 45-minute wait, we snagged the vacant bar stools along the front window. Best seats in the house, in my opinion. Great people watching and good service. As for the food, I have three words for you: fancy corn dogs. Heck, I love the frozen kind, so I was floored when we were served cake pop style yummy corn dogs with fancy mustard that I couldn’t eat because it was infused with beer. Oh yeah, I don’t drink, so I won’t be commenting on any of their specialty cocktails. My club soda with no ice and a wedge of lemon was spot on, though. After dinner, we met up with our group at Lake Effects pop-up holiday bar in The Schofield Building. Every sober person’s dream: a Friday night at a Christmas bar in downtown Cleveland. As a former professional drinker, this had amateur hour written all over it. Not long after we walked in, I had to hit the little girls room. Of course the line was eons long, so I opted to sneak over to the hotel lobby and use their much larger facilities. Another reveler, decked out in her best ugly, but trying to be cute, Christmas sweater led the way … sort of. She was unusually hammered for so early in the evening, but a hoot nonetheless. After pushing the wrong side of the door several times, she was so thrilled to finally get it open that she threw her arm around me and jubilantly celebrated the half block to the hotel lobby, remarking over and over how ‘we’ couldn’t get the door open, but finally did. With no way to ditch my new best friend as we approached the quiet and civilized lobby, I muttered a few ‘be cool’s,’ which she repeated back to me in her best whisper slur. Once in the stall (separate, thank God), I fulfilled my bathroom duties with the sheer determination to escape before she could flush her toilet. I quickly scurried down the block hoping upon hope she was too far behind to see me. One might think that was the highlight of the evening. Well, my friends, you’d be wrong. Back in the sauna-like bar, we set up shop in a corner fit with a small couch and chairs. We had just settled in for our long winter’s evening when all of a sudden there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my seat as the contents of a shelf went splatter right where I’d been sitting. Someone had apparently banged into the partition-like wall hard enough to send the decor tumbling. Painted hardcover books, a watering can, and a thick glass Christmas tree remained on the wobbly shelf, so I wisely removed the items before they had their own chance to fall off. Five minutes later, the owner\/manager\/bar-back came guns blazing to our table shouting at me to open my purse and remove the stolen wall decor from my tiny handbag. Clearly misinformed, I did what every mature, sober 40-year-old woman does. I stood up, pointed my finger right at him and yelled “Duck you!” (Damn you, autocorrect). “You’re ducking decorations nearly smashed me on the head.” And then I proceeded to repeat the first statement a few more times before he cowered away from our table, shaking the guys’ hands and apologizing for the accusation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3c8b868a-a1b4-4091-9c5a-f0dec4f2c8e4>"]},{"passage":"For dog lovers, leaving their beloved dog for a period of time while on vacation is usually heart-wrenching. Bringing your pets on trips can be hassling at times, especially when the destinations you're bound to visit are not pet-friendly. But good news!

Here are some of the best places you and your pup can go to for an unforgettable bonding time:\nAustin, Texas. Austin is one of the best places to bond in for you and your furry pal. The place is teeming with lots of fun activities and entertainment, such as cheap festivals and concerts where dogs are allowed. According to Trips to Discover, Barton Creek Greenbelt and Zilker Metropolitan Park are also great places to play with your pet, and there's the Groovy Dog Bakery to buy your pet some treats. Carmel by the Sea, California. This seaside village is rated one of the best dog-friendly towns in the whole country, and it can't be doubted when the 25 hotels, inns, 44 restaurants, bars and coffee houses found in the village are all pooch-friendly.

They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year.

Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!\nBut the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.\nAnd if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).\nSo, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!\n1. Pack LAYERS.\nThere is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n2. Anticipate darkness.\nThis may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.\n3. Pack sustainable food.\nWhen I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup\/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt\/pepper\/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs\/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!\n4. Embrace the gross\nDepending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!\n5. Anticipate problems\nKnock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:\n- Lots of water\n- Toilet paper\n- A good knife\n- A lighter or box of matches\n- First aid kit\n- A map and compass\n- Storm-proof outdoor gear\n- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)\n6. Bring some of the good stuff\nCamping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.\nAlways make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.\nDo you have any good camping tips to share?

Vanity goes out of the window when you are in the wilderness. One is in the mountains to survive in the simplest forms like the mountain men. Because that’s how Yeti is supposed to be. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore your personal hygiene too. Spending days in the wilderness on long treks like Roopkund Trek, Pin Parvati Pass with no bath can make you stink like a raccoon and make you feel all icky and lousy. Maintaining personal hygiene on the trek is as important as keeping yourself hydrated on the trek. Not only it keeps the diseases at bay but also helps you feel fresh and vigorous for a longer time. These things can feel a bit of a struggle with no proper sanitation facilities available on the trek as we are used to back in the comfort of our homes. Here is how you can carry out your personal hygiene manners on the trek without any fuss:\n1. Making your business\nDo not defecate where you eat. Even the dogs follow this simple rule. Then why not we humans. Keep these things in mind next to you attend nature's call in the woods. - Do not make a toilet tent or dig a hole near your camp. The defecation area should be at least 50 meters away from your tent and the water source. - Dig a 6-inch deep hole for your business. A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2. Changing clothes on the trek\nHow often should you change clothes on trek? If it is a long trek, it is wise option to rotate your clothes. Segregate your hiking clothes and camping clothes. After you reach the camping site, change into clean and dry clothing. Your sweaty clothes from hiking can end up giving you body rashes and bad odor. Sleeping with soiled clothes on in your sleeping bag can really make you uncomfortable. Plus, your sleeping will bag will start to stink too. Next day, when you resume trekking, you can change back into your trekking clothes. Avoid changing into a different pair of clothes in sub-zero temperatures on the treks like Bali Pass and Goecha La unless absolutely necessary. 3. How to take a dry bath\n“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess\nYou are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:\n- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air. It’s better you leave it at home. - Change your clothes in the daytime when the temperature is comparatively warm. Working up a sweat on the trek is always wow. But it will just be a matter of few days when the flies start meandering around you if ignore your personal hygiene. Not a pretty picture, right? Following these hygiene tips can save you from the humiliation.\n\nTable of Contents\nGood personal hygiene is one of the best ways to protect yourself from getting illnesses such as gastroenteritis and the common cold. Washing your hands with soap removes germs that can make you ill. Maintaining good personal hygiene will also help prevent you from spreading diseases to other people. What is personal hygiene? Personal hygiene includes:\n- cleaning your body every day\n- washing your hands with soap after going to the toilet\n- brushing your teeth twice a day\n- covering your mouth and nose with a tissue (or your sleeve) when sneezing or coughing\n- washing your hands after handling pets and other animals\nWhy is personal hygiene important? Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through touching other people, getting faeces (poo) on your hands, handling contaminated food and coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects. Conditions that you can develop if you have poor personal hygiene include:\nWashing your body\nTry to bath or shower each day. Wash well, especially under your armpits and around your genitals and anus. Keeping clean will prevent skin irritations and remove bacteria that cause body odour. Wash yourself with soap, shower gel or a hypoallergenic body wash. Soap removes more germs, but you may need to wash sensitive body parts with plain water or salt water. If there is no tap water or it is scarce, clean yourself with a clean wet cloth or sponge. Washing your hands\nTo avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly. - Wet your hands, then wash with soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds. Lather between the fingers and the back of your hands. - Clean grubby nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available. - Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water. - Dry off your hands with a clean towel or let them dry in the air. When to wash your hands\nIt is especially important to wash your hands after going to the toilet because faeces, which you might come into contact with, contains billions of germs. Also, wash your hands:\n- before and after eating or preparing food\n- after changing babies’ nappies\n- before and after touching a sick person or cleaning up vomit or body fluids\n- after blowing your nose\n- before and after treating cuts or wounds\n- after touching rubbish, dirty surfaces or objects\n- after handling pets or farm animals\nFind out more here about hand washing. Washing your genitals\nMen who are uncircumcised can clean their penis by gently pulling back the foreskin and washing underneath it with warm water or soap. See more here about penis care. Women can gently wash the delicate skin around the vulva with a soap-free wash, salt water or plain water. Avoid perfumed soap and bath products since these may irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Do not douche, because it upsets the healthy good bacteria in your vagina. During menstruation (your periods), wash your vulva as usual. Tampons can be changed every 3 to 4 hours. To avoid toxic shock syndrome, do not leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours. Change sanitary pads several times a day. Wash your hands before and after changing tampons or pads. Preventing body odour\nAfter washing, apply deodorant to your armpits. Put on clean, dry clothing.

It's not just less time that is spent on personal hygiene in winter, but less money too. The average monthly spend on personal hygiene products in the UK is £29.57, but 18% of Brits reduce their spending during the winter. Part of the reason for this seasonal difference is that we get less hot and sweaty during the winter months (57% cited this), but many Brits admit that it's simply too cold to shower so frequently in winter. In fact , 34% of us admit to bathing or showering less frequently in the winter, with a quarter of adults preferring to spend more time in bed as the cold dark mornings leave us feeling more tired. Meanwhile 2\/3 of women shave less their legs less frequently in the winter and 56% stated that their feet are neglected in the colder months. Raffaela De Vittorio, Marketing Director for Geberit AquaClean, which conducted the study, said: \"During the winter months many of us would rather grab some extra time under a warm duvet than in the bathroom, which is where the latest shower toilet technology really comes into its own. Gently cleaning you with warm water after each use, the Geberit AquaClean ensures healthy personal hygiene levels are maintained whatever the weather.\" While 15% of Brits would consider installing a shower toilet, currently just 6% of the survey's respondents use one, with the most popular way of cleaning after using the toilet being with wet wipes (40%), followed by showering (19%). However, taking a shower can be time consuming, particularly when compared to using a shower toilet. Despite people taking less time to clean themselves during the winter months, a staggering 10% of adults admit that they don't change their underwear every day, with 1% even owning up to doing so less than once a week! \"The research shows that despite the average Brit spending less time in the bathroom during the winter, their desire to feel fresh and clean is just as strong as in the summer and with so many people admitting to not changing their underwear regularly, a shower toilet ensures that personal hygiene levels are maintained no matter what the season is,\" adds Raffaela.

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave.

Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.\n\nWhat hygiene essentials should you include in your travel package? - Body Wash\n- Face Wash\n- Toothbrush and Toothpaste\n- Shampoo and Conditioner\n- Travel Bag\nWhen it comes to travelling it is best to have all the things you need for your trip all prepared and ready. From your travelling clothes, your travel documents, gadgets like your phone, camera, and laptop, to your body and skin care kit (with products coming from brands like Beyond Philippines). Remember that overall hygiene whilst you’re travelling all over the Philippines is important, which is why you have to be sure that you have all your essentials with you. With that in mind, here are some of the hygiene essentials that you must have in your travel package:\nYour own soap\nWhile most hotels and resorts would be able to provide you with most of the toiletries that you would need during your stay, the other places that you might be going to – especially the outdoors – will not be able to offer the same luxury. For this reason, it is best to make sure that you have a bar of soap or two while travelling. This would always come in handy, particularly when you’re going camping or to places with limited access to toiletries. Soap is one of the quickest and best ways to clean yourself up in any situation. Along with soap, having a small bottle of body wash could get you a long way in keeping you clean. Having this item would be a better way to clean you up more thoroughly after an exciting day going around. This would help you remove all that dirt, grime, and sweat you procured the entire day. Having some face wash would keep your face smooth and glowing during the day, and prevent it from getting oily as well as protect it from dirt. Bringing one around is not a hassle for your luggage as well, as you would only need a few sachets when travelling, and you would only need small drops of it to be effective. Make sure that you get some face wash that fits your skin health, as not all face washes would be able to provide the same type of care for different skin types. Another solid travel alternative would be face wipes, which provide you a quick way to clean your face on the go. Perhaps one of the most important things that you should never leave without when travelling – always have a toothbrush with you. Oral hygiene is very important, especially when you plan on having a food and drink adventure. There are many kinds of travel-ready toothbrushes available, which ensure that you have enough space for all of your other hygiene needs. Along with a toothbrush, make sure that you have some travel-sized toothpaste with you as well. There are toothpaste sachets and tablets to make sure that you would be able to travel light. Another oral hygiene essential, flossing after brushing your teeth is something that you should regularly do, even when you are travelling. Dental floss comes in portable packages that fit in your travel kit well, which means you won’t have to worry about space. Of course, you can’t forget about applying some deodorant after a good shower. Deodorant keeps different kinds of body odor in check and ensures that you are fresh and cool throughout your adventures. Solid deodorant is best for travelling, as it can withstand different kinds of weather, which makes it last longer. Deodorant comes in travel-friendly packages, which means you can bring a stick or two with no problem. Shampoo and Conditioner\nSince the weather can be constantly changing when you travel, it is advisable to take care of your hair in the best way with some good shampoo and conditioner. For summer destinations, it is best to get shampoo that keeps your hair cool during those warm days. Having conditioner would make sure that you would be able to keep your hair protected from the sun and healthy when you head out, which helps you keep yourself fresh. Every now and then, you would have to shave off some growing hair during your trip, especially if you are planning to travel for a few days. Make sure that you keep a razor in handy during your trips to keep yourself clean and fresh, and keep those unwanted hairs away. Of course, the most important thing that you need is the bag that would be able to carry all of the aforementioned items. Most travel bags would be able to carry around all of your hygiene needs listed above, and they won’t take up too much space in your luggage.\n\nQuestion:Is changing underwear daily considered particularly important for maintaining personal hygiene while camping without shower access?","passages":[{"passage":"How to maintain personal hygiene on a trek!

It's not just less time that is spent on personal hygiene in winter, but less money too. The average monthly spend on personal hygiene products in the UK is £29.57, but 18% of Brits reduce their spending during the winter. Part of the reason for this seasonal difference is that we get less hot and sweaty during the winter months (57% cited this), but many Brits admit that it's simply too cold to shower so frequently in winter. In fact , 34% of us admit to bathing or showering less frequently in the winter, with a quarter of adults preferring to spend more time in bed as the cold dark mornings leave us feeling more tired. Meanwhile 2\/3 of women shave less their legs less frequently in the winter and 56% stated that their feet are neglected in the colder months. Raffaela De Vittorio, Marketing Director for Geberit AquaClean, which conducted the study, said: \"During the winter months many of us would rather grab some extra time under a warm duvet than in the bathroom, which is where the latest shower toilet technology really comes into its own. Gently cleaning you with warm water after each use, the Geberit AquaClean ensures healthy personal hygiene levels are maintained whatever the weather.\" While 15% of Brits would consider installing a shower toilet, currently just 6% of the survey's respondents use one, with the most popular way of cleaning after using the toilet being with wet wipes (40%), followed by showering (19%). However, taking a shower can be time consuming, particularly when compared to using a shower toilet. Despite people taking less time to clean themselves during the winter months, a staggering 10% of adults admit that they don't change their underwear every day, with 1% even owning up to doing so less than once a week! \"The research shows that despite the average Brit spending less time in the bathroom during the winter, their desire to feel fresh and clean is just as strong as in the summer and with so many people admitting to not changing their underwear regularly, a shower toilet ensures that personal hygiene levels are maintained no matter what the season is,\" adds Raffaela.

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully\nShaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:44cb67a2-acfc-445e-b0a0-a844062c16b3>"]},{"passage":"Prepare yourself for the cold with these fleece lined thermal underwear for men! - Strong Moisture Wicking(Without the Sweaty Mess): Our fans say the unique breathable, moisture-wicking fibers on CL thermal underwear will wick away moisture to keep you dry with no sticky or clammy feeling so you can wear them all day for your work or snow adventure.

Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8966706c-efe6-4dc8-90d8-a1012608d4a6>"]},{"passage":"What hygiene essentials should you include in your travel package? - Body Wash\n- Face Wash\n- Toothbrush and Toothpaste\n- Shampoo and Conditioner\n- Travel Bag\nWhen it comes to travelling it is best to have all the things you need for your trip all prepared and ready. From your travelling clothes, your travel documents, gadgets like your phone, camera, and laptop, to your body and skin care kit (with products coming from brands like Beyond Philippines). Remember that overall hygiene whilst you’re travelling all over the Philippines is important, which is why you have to be sure that you have all your essentials with you. With that in mind, here are some of the hygiene essentials that you must have in your travel package:\nYour own soap\nWhile most hotels and resorts would be able to provide you with most of the toiletries that you would need during your stay, the other places that you might be going to – especially the outdoors – will not be able to offer the same luxury. For this reason, it is best to make sure that you have a bar of soap or two while travelling. This would always come in handy, particularly when you’re going camping or to places with limited access to toiletries. Soap is one of the quickest and best ways to clean yourself up in any situation. Along with soap, having a small bottle of body wash could get you a long way in keeping you clean. Having this item would be a better way to clean you up more thoroughly after an exciting day going around. This would help you remove all that dirt, grime, and sweat you procured the entire day. Having some face wash would keep your face smooth and glowing during the day, and prevent it from getting oily as well as protect it from dirt. Bringing one around is not a hassle for your luggage as well, as you would only need a few sachets when travelling, and you would only need small drops of it to be effective. Make sure that you get some face wash that fits your skin health, as not all face washes would be able to provide the same type of care for different skin types. Another solid travel alternative would be face wipes, which provide you a quick way to clean your face on the go. Perhaps one of the most important things that you should never leave without when travelling – always have a toothbrush with you. Oral hygiene is very important, especially when you plan on having a food and drink adventure. There are many kinds of travel-ready toothbrushes available, which ensure that you have enough space for all of your other hygiene needs. Along with a toothbrush, make sure that you have some travel-sized toothpaste with you as well. There are toothpaste sachets and tablets to make sure that you would be able to travel light. Another oral hygiene essential, flossing after brushing your teeth is something that you should regularly do, even when you are travelling. Dental floss comes in portable packages that fit in your travel kit well, which means you won’t have to worry about space. Of course, you can’t forget about applying some deodorant after a good shower. Deodorant keeps different kinds of body odor in check and ensures that you are fresh and cool throughout your adventures. Solid deodorant is best for travelling, as it can withstand different kinds of weather, which makes it last longer. Deodorant comes in travel-friendly packages, which means you can bring a stick or two with no problem. Shampoo and Conditioner\nSince the weather can be constantly changing when you travel, it is advisable to take care of your hair in the best way with some good shampoo and conditioner. For summer destinations, it is best to get shampoo that keeps your hair cool during those warm days. Having conditioner would make sure that you would be able to keep your hair protected from the sun and healthy when you head out, which helps you keep yourself fresh. Every now and then, you would have to shave off some growing hair during your trip, especially if you are planning to travel for a few days. Make sure that you keep a razor in handy during your trips to keep yourself clean and fresh, and keep those unwanted hairs away. Of course, the most important thing that you need is the bag that would be able to carry all of the aforementioned items. Most travel bags would be able to carry around all of your hygiene needs listed above, and they won’t take up too much space in your luggage.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b55e1898-1489-4a2d-aec8-c013bb0e3ec1>"]}]}
{"id":7,"doc_id":"<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>","text":"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.\nWhile you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.\nThe popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.\nThe first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?\nSecondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?\nAlso, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.\nOnce you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!\nThe forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.\nThe second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.\nSome group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.\nThe the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.\nThe performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.\nAdjourning or Mourning\nAt some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.\nImportant Note: This blog is intended for informational and discussion purposes only, and does not substitute for professional care.

Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.\n\nI then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.\n\nSuccessful people have very busy lives and to be blunt, they usually want to mastermind with people who are at or above the level they are at right now. That’s why the mix of a group like a group like this is so important. This Mastermind is a hand-picked, deliberately matched, very high level, for high achievers and limited to 6-12 members. I started with the people I wanted to mastermind with the most and then invited people that I think will be a perfect match for people I first put in the group because…\n- They are already operating at a very high level. - They will contribute in a powerful way to the group. - They will match the spirit and goals of the group. The investment to be in the group is $10,000 per year. Imagine 6 to 12 of the people YOU most want to work with in a group that meets in person three times a year for a day or two on an on-going basis with an online platform for maintaining those relationships in between the live events, plus an options 4th event just for fun. We will decide as a group exactly where to hold the events, how to schedule them and what format the events will take. I handpick people for this group one by one, because there’s a nagging desire in my brain to take things up a notch. - Higher level, not lower. - A longer time-frame, not less. - More commitment, not less. - Deeper involvement, not less. Okay, not exactly a marriage, but at least a year long-relationship. At the end of the year, we can decide if we want to extend it, but here’s the level of commitment. - One year commitment\n- 3 – “meet in person” 1 – 2 day masterminds\n- 6 – 12 people in the mastermind\n- All invested serious entrepreneurs who are hand-picked, for quality, positive generous spirit, clear synergy and high commitment level. I have a number of people committed to this group and if I told you who they were, you would be impressed. The bottom-line investment is $10,000 per year for the year’s commitment. There are only 12 spots maximum because any number over would be too big. We decide on dates as a group. In between the 3 live events we will maintain our relationships online and via webcasts. If you want to be considered for the group, you need to let me know now and we need to have a serious conversation to see if it’s a good match for you. Fill out the form below, if you are serious about being in this group.\n\nWe think the Concepts workshop is especially useful for people who are ready to engage deeply with EA ideas, but for whatever reason aren't a good fit for your intro fellowship or other intro program. We think the workshop is best with a small number of participants - maybe between 6 and 12. But, if you wanted to run it with a larger group, you could do so with some small adjustments. Our resources pack includes:\n- Slides (with speaker notes)\n- Organiser guide\n- Feedback form\n\nThey allow for growth (when two friends of the current Cubs want to join up along the way), they’re manageable for most DLs (including those with ADLs), and they’re also manageable for Boy Scouts who come aboard as Den Chiefs! Six is a near-perfect number for outings (three “buddy-pairs”), and for handling advancement activities in den meetings. I’ve had lots of experience with DLs who want to have “super-dens” of ten, twelve, and even more…they all invariably fail because when one or two don’t show up the DL is actually thankful, a group of a dozen or more boys will automatically divide themselves into at least two smaller groups anyway, and outings become totally unwieldy. What typically happens is that a beginning den of a dozen (or thereabouts) Wolf Cubs dwindles over the next several years (boys can’t get the personal attention they need and any “troubled” or “shy” ones drop out or get lost in the shuffle anyway), and that den is lucky if it graduates four or five remaining into a Boy Scout troop. The key is to “force” no one! Simply ask the Cubs themselves to form groups of between 5 and 7, by age\/grade, with no one left out. They can do this pretty much by themselves, with a bit of “over-watching” (and sometimes guiding–but with feathers, not baseball bats!). As for “closing” dens to new members…that’s just not part of the objectives of Scouting. We’re here to be INclusive, not EXclusive. That’s why a den of six is a very nice number…and even five can work well! At five or six, the “bonding” is a thing of beauty! Double that number and instead of bonding it becomes an exercise in greased pig wrangling. You, as Cubmaster, and your Committee Chair, need to be united on this: You’ll need the Buddy System yourselves to deal with the renegades that want to form “mini-packs” inside the pack itself! Support one another, don’t cave in, and never make exceptions! But do this all with smiles–all the time! PS, once you’re set up, be sure ALL of you go to training at the same time – After all, you all need some bonding, too! Have a question? Facing a dilemma?

But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups. Resists the temptation to coordinate everything in a big, clarifying conversation.\n\nDifference between revisions of \"TeamUp\"\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n|Line 148:||Line 148:|\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\nNote that, depending on student responses, it may happen that no group composition is perfectly optimal.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.\n\nIt’s my second week in NY and I sat in on Tom Igoe’s class on Understanding Networks. I’ll do some comparisons between his class and a typical undergraduate class I took, when I was in college. The first thing is the class size, 16 students at ITP compared to 48 students at IOE (Institute of Engineering). I was wondering how ITP came up with the number 16, did they experiment with smaller or larger groups and settled for 16 to be the optimal number. I should probably ask this the next time I run into any faculty members. The second thing is the classroom arrangement, the students at ITP sit around tables arranged in the middle of the room, facing each other. At IOE, we’d sit on benches that were arranged in rows all facing the teacher and the energy flow would be from the teacher to the student. The energy flow in the class at ITP is more organic and involves everyone in the class, not just the teacher.\n\nI’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.\n\nGroups are extremely buzzword compliant. You get active engagement, collaboration, and become a facilitator all in one move. Well, provided you are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes and have enough tasks to fill the time. I hypothosized about it previously, and now I think I have a good plan. It could all explode in my face and I'll have to retool, but here's how it's going to work. Week 1 and 2 are Boot Camp. This year I have Pre-Cal and Algebra II, so they're both getting it. Algebra II will be a little modified and approached differently. Several of the topics covered fit in nicely with the first few sections, others should probably wait until later, and the degree of difficulty will need to be adjusted. After Boot Camp, the class will be split into groups. Class sizes indicate that 6 groups of 5 is the way to go for me. Desk arrangement is the fun part of that one. Desks are labeled 1-5, each group is a color. I will change the groups every so often, probably at grading period end. Big picture class format:\n- Instead of homework, a task will be given to each student when we start new topics\n- The task will cover all items ahead of us with a large problem set, sourced from a textbook to save time\n- Each group member must complete the task prior to a test, the task serves double duty as the review\n- The task will cover problems that require more than one mind to figure out\n- Those harder task problems will be intended for class discussion\n- How and when the students complete the task is up to them, there will be some time in class for this purpose\n- Tasks are pasted into a notebook, no task is accepted outside of a notebook\n- Each student will keep a notebook where all tasks, warm ups, examples, \"now you try\", WCYDWT questions live\n- Students will be assessed on the topics of the week frequently\nThis format will reign most of the time unless I have something special in mind. Calculators and voting devices will be kept in the vicinity of the group rather than in a central location to minimize foot traffic and readiness time. Grading expectations are as follows:\nHow I determine that 10% Group portion is still being worked out. Part of it should include assessment from the group members to add a little fear that your teammates will flunk you if you're a punk. Notebooks are collected\/inspected prior to reporting periods and must have whatever tasks I feel should have been completed by then. Algebra II will be tested in a Standards Based format, so it is expected that they'll have all their test scores recorded as well. In the future, possibly second semester, I hope to find a way to award groups points as we go along, similar to what they do on Around the Horn (an ESPN show, sportswriters are voted up\/down by the host based on what they say and eventually one writer \"wins\"). College gave me the idea for a single, large, weekly assignment and group member evaluation, and the whole concept from my 6th grade math teacher. Lastly, randomizing and rotating is a big part of active engagement, and what does any mega nerd with an engineering degree do to address this? Popsicle sticks, right? No! Call an amazing programmer friend of yours and make an app for that (features pending):\n\nQuestion:Is the optimal size for most task-oriented groups between 6 and 12 members?","passages":[{"passage":"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>"]},{"passage":"I then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:13974a23-5853-426c-983d-f8bd026b4fe5>"]},{"passage":"Successful people have very busy lives and to be blunt, they usually want to mastermind with people who are at or above the level they are at right now.

Six is a near-perfect number for outings (three “buddy-pairs”), and for handling advancement activities in den meetings. I’ve had lots of experience with DLs who want to have “super-dens” of ten, twelve, and even more…they all invariably fail because when one or two don’t show up the DL is actually thankful, a group of a dozen or more boys will automatically divide themselves into at least two smaller groups anyway, and outings become totally unwieldy. What typically happens is that a beginning den of a dozen (or thereabouts) Wolf Cubs dwindles over the next several years (boys can’t get the personal attention they need and any “troubled” or “shy” ones drop out or get lost in the shuffle anyway), and that den is lucky if it graduates four or five remaining into a Boy Scout troop. The key is to “force” no one! Simply ask the Cubs themselves to form groups of between 5 and 7, by age\/grade, with no one left out. They can do this pretty much by themselves, with a bit of “over-watching” (and sometimes guiding–but with feathers, not baseball bats!). As for “closing” dens to new members…that’s just not part of the objectives of Scouting. We’re here to be INclusive, not EXclusive. That’s why a den of six is a very nice number…and even five can work well! At five or six, the “bonding” is a thing of beauty!

But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b7547913-b9d3-45cd-a542-4dd476d41409>"]},{"passage":"It’s my second week in NY and I sat in on Tom Igoe’s class on Understanding Networks. I’ll do some comparisons between his class and a typical undergraduate class I took, when I was in college. The first thing is the class size, 16 students at ITP compared to 48 students at IOE (Institute of Engineering). I was wondering how ITP came up with the number 16, did they experiment with smaller or larger groups and settled for 16 to be the optimal number. I should probably ask this the next time I run into any faculty members. The second thing is the classroom arrangement, the students at ITP sit around tables arranged in the middle of the room, facing each other. At IOE, we’d sit on benches that were arranged in rows all facing the teacher and the energy flow would be from the teacher to the student. The energy flow in the class at ITP is more organic and involves everyone in the class, not just the teacher.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5e58338b-9069-402d-afee-9884b14c84b4>"]},{"passage":"I’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1d39addb-a557-46b4-8dfd-8c87ec1567f6>"]},{"passage":"Groups are extremely buzzword compliant. You get active engagement, collaboration, and become a facilitator all in one move. Well, provided you are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes and have enough tasks to fill the time. I hypothosized about it previously, and now I think I have a good plan. It could all explode in my face and I'll have to retool, but here's how it's going to work. Week 1 and 2 are Boot Camp. This year I have Pre-Cal and Algebra II, so they're both getting it. Algebra II will be a little modified and approached differently. Several of the topics covered fit in nicely with the first few sections, others should probably wait until later, and the degree of difficulty will need to be adjusted. After Boot Camp, the class will be split into groups. Class sizes indicate that 6 groups of 5 is the way to go for me. Desk arrangement is the fun part of that one. Desks are labeled 1-5, each group is a color. I will change the groups every so often, probably at grading period end. Big picture class format:\n- Instead of homework, a task will be given to each student when we start new topics\n- The task will cover all items ahead of us with a large problem set, sourced from a textbook to save time\n- Each group member must complete the task prior to a test, the task serves double duty as the review\n- The task will cover problems that require more than one mind to figure out\n- Those harder task problems will be intended for class discussion\n- How and when the students complete the task is up to them, there will be some time in class for this purpose\n- Tasks are pasted into a notebook, no task is accepted outside of a notebook\n- Each student will keep a notebook where all tasks, warm ups, examples, \"now you try\", WCYDWT questions live\n- Students will be assessed on the topics of the week frequently\nThis format will reign most of the time unless I have something special in mind. Calculators and voting devices will be kept in the vicinity of the group rather than in a central location to minimize foot traffic and readiness time. Grading expectations are as follows:\nHow I determine that 10% Group portion is still being worked out. Part of it should include assessment from the group members to add a little fear that your teammates will flunk you if you're a punk. Notebooks are collected\/inspected prior to reporting periods and must have whatever tasks I feel should have been completed by then. Algebra II will be tested in a Standards Based format, so it is expected that they'll have all their test scores recorded as well. In the future, possibly second semester, I hope to find a way to award groups points as we go along, similar to what they do on Around the Horn (an ESPN show, sportswriters are voted up\/down by the host based on what they say and eventually one writer \"wins\"). College gave me the idea for a single, large, weekly assignment and group member evaluation, and the whole concept from my 6th grade math teacher. Lastly, randomizing and rotating is a big part of active engagement, and what does any mega nerd with an engineering degree do to address this? Popsicle sticks, right? No!

There’s something about getting soaked in Tomato juice that seems to put a great big smile on everyone’s face. Dump trucks are brought to the scene and people get to dive in and start throwing tomatoes. All the action is followed by celebrations of food and drink and dance. Over 150,000 tomatoes are used every year which come from Extremadura, a less expensive tomato.\nAt 11:00am canons sound by exploding tomato-packed rockets at the people to commence the event. Over 30,000 people show up for the tomato throw down. In 2013, city officials introduced an entry fee and limited the number of participants, citing concerns over safety. At 12:00p.m. the canons sound again signaling that the tomato throwing has come to its end.\nTomato Throwing Pointers:\n- Participants must use goggles and gloves.\n- All tomatoes must be crushed before bring thrown to avoid risk of injury.\n- No other projectiles are allowed to be thrown.\nThe whole idea of a Tomato throwing festival wasn’t an idea at all but an angry play that took place back in August of 1945, when a group of young people went into the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade.

Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering.\nUtilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98).\nWhile this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00).\nWe also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas!\nInterestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys.\nIndeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units).\nWhile the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering.\nParents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships?\nFor more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier.\nPosted Mar 30, 2022","question_category":"Clarification","question_category_desc":"A question seeking further explanation or details about a specific concept, term, or methodology","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the subject matter","question":"What statistical analysis methods were used to examine the relationship between children's STEM interests and their friends' attitudes towards science and engineering?","gold":"Two main statistical methods were used: T-Tests and regression models.

The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption.\nThe phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF).\nThe project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina.\nLight signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second.\nAnother more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.","question_category":"Comparison","question_category_desc":"A question that compares the information in the document to other studies, perspectives, or contexts","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the subject matter","question":"How do the storage capabilities of optical computing systems based on 'fast and slow' light compare to current electronic storage methods?","gold":"Currently, light signals cannot yet be stored directly or used for computation, despite being used for communication over fiber optic cables.

That seems increasingly elusive in our overnetworked society, where every buzz and rumor is instantly blogged and tweeted, and it is not contemplation we desire but an odd sort of distraction, distraction masquerading as being in the know. In such a landscape, knowledge can’t help but fall prey to illusion, albeit an illusion that is deeply seductive, with its promise that speed can lead us to more illumination, that it is more important to react than to think deeply, that something must be attached to every bit of time. Here, we have my reading problem in a nutshell, for books insist we take the opposite position, that we immerse, slow down.”\n– David L. Ulin, The Lost Art of Reading\nNotes: Quote – Litverve. Photograph: Amoris-Causa\nView original post\nMontaigne portrait – Dali 1947\nMeditation is a rich and powerful method of study for anyone who knows how to examine his mind, and to employ it vigorously. I would rather shape my soul than furnish it. There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne\n“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large.

It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\n“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself.

Call them at 970-879-0825, email email@example.com... or visit the Extension Office, 136 Sixth St.\nLast week, I took a couple hikes on some of the trails that have finally dried out from snowmelt. All along the Hinman Fisherman’s Trail was one of my favorite early season flowers, the Glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). This exquisite and delicate small flower features curved yellow petals with stamens that protrude from the flower’s center. The leafless stems are 6 to 12 inches long and bend at the top giving the flower an elegant drooping profile.\nAlso called dogtooth violet and snow lily, glacier lilies provide early season food for much wildlife in our area, including bears, deer and elk who eat the corms (the swollen underground part of the stem that stores energy for next year — not quite a bulb, but close) and green seed pods, as will sheep and cattle. Ground squirrels and other rodents dig up the corms and store them for winter consumption.\nAlthough it is a really pretty flower that would look great in a meadow or garden, it generally should not be dug up from its habitats in the wild as it sends its corms deep into the soil. Most of us would end up digging up only the leaves and their stems, killing the pretty plant.\nIt’s an edible plant, as well as a spring beauty. The corm is edible raw but tastier and easier to digest when cooked. The stems and leaves of glacier lilies are also edible, although less nutritious than the corms, and can sometimes be found adding a touch of color and texture to salad greens. The seedpod, which forms after the flower bloom has ended, is also edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. It tastes a little like green beans. As with any of these wild edible plants, it’s best to eat in moderation to avoid upsetting your stomach.\nLater in the week, I hiked the Sarvis Creek trail in the southern part of the county and was enchanted by all the Mountain Bluebells (Mertensia ciliata ) in bloom along the way. A member of the Boraginaceae (forget- me-not or borage) family, this widely dispersed perennial features a four-foot tall, three-foot wide plant with blue-green leaves that feature fine hairs (hence the name ciliata) and small, bell-shaped flower clusters that start out light blue and become pinkish purple as the flower ages. It’s usually found in wet meadows and along stream banks throughout the western U.S. and is sometimes found as a single plant but often as a whole colony along a stream or wet meadow. It’s an aromatic and beautiful early season flower.\nThe bell-shaped flowers are edible, as are the leaves, but the leaves aren’t very palatable raw with their hairy coating. Native Americans had medicinal uses for this plant.\nAs the weather turns nice, be sure to get out and see all the early-season wildflowers our part of the mountains feature during this short blooming season.\nDeb Babcock is a volunteer Master Gardener through the CSU Extension Routt County.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Steamboat and Routt County make the Steamboat Pilot & Today’s work possible.

However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent.\nThroughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret.\nGuilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you.\nGuilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.\nI’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP.\nI think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day.\nJust as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret.\nP.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP.\nLoss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\nAs someone with CP, I’ve felt loss and regret to because of the CP. I felt loss when I realized I had to give up my dream as a kid to become a professional soccer player, and I’ve felt both feelings when I couldn’t participate in something with my friends or felt like an outsider. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate something that has always been there as a part of the CP, and that is my initial perspective on life.\nAs I mentioned above, life with CP is all I know, and all I will know. This has some really good benefits. It means that I won’t always feel the need or desire to be closer to “normal”, simply because I have no idea what it means to not have CP, I can’t really imagine it. This can create some conflicts between the person with CP and their loved ones too. Where the parents for example may want to push their child to exercise more, stretch more, or try harder to walk or walk better, the person with CP, may be content with their functional level as it is, and may not see the point.\nWe both have a responsibility here. The parent should try to understand this, that we don’t necessarily want to be just like an able bodied. Some may, but that may lead to more harm than good. You can’t change the CP; you can’t cure it, at least not right now. And because of that, if you are constantly want something you cannot have, and constantly hating what you have and what you are, you are going to be pretty miserable. Therefore, I would advise you, as a parent to help your child accept their CP rather than fight it. It is not your enemy, nor is it theirs, its a part of them.\nAs people with CP we also have to understand that even if we don’t always see the change the point in stretching or exercises, or even surgeries, we should try to think of the fact that we want to stay happy in the future. The work that you put down now, can be really important later down the road. I used to hate this kind of reasoning however, and I am not expecting you to like it either, so if that doesn’t motivate you, try to find smaller more achievable goals of improvement that you can see in a shorter time period.\nAlso, remember that because your parents want you to exercise more, or walk better or what have you, it doesn’t mean they think you aren’t good enough, you are, and its not about that. They view life from their perspective, and what they have been able to do and enjoy in life, they just want you to feel many of the joys in life that they have, because they love you, not because they don’t think you’re good enough.\nIt is my hope that we can continue to learn from each other, and grow together. That way, we can heal each other and the scars that may open, so I hope you will accept and embrace this open letter as my contribution towards that.\nIf you have had any of these feelings and experiences, either as a parent or as someone with CP, please feel free to comment below and share on your favourite social media, it really helps us grow and write more of these articles!

Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many.\nA new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain.\nThe cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop.\n\"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\nIntervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster.\nAlthough past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine.\nThis study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans.\nEach disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine.\nDr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\nOn average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not.\n\"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\"\nThe study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA. Research presented at conferences may not have been peer-reviewed.\nInformation on funding sources and conflicts of interest was not available at the time of publication.","question_category":"long,\nfancy language","question_category_desc":"a long question with at least 7 words,\na question phrased with fancy English","user_category":"non (used detault)","user_category_desc":null,"question":"How does nicotine consumption affect the health of intervertebral discs in the human body?","gold":"Nicotine can damage the microvasculature system, which consists of small blood vessels that line either side of the intervertebral discs and provide them with nourishment.

I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below: Here are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones: Sleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement This is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight It’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad You want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad Yes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up Hold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so: Pretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes Let’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly. Take the jacket’s measurements. This will come in handy when you’re looking to buy suiting online. Measuring a garment is similar to measuring your body, but easier. You’re essentially taking the same measurements you would on yourself. Lay your garment on a flat surface, and follow this measuring guide: (need the full size version? click here.) BOOM! You’re equipped. Make sure to keep these numbers on a Post-it and stick it in your wallet for quick reference, and shop online with confidence, armed with the knowledge of your own measurements.

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include: 2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles 3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation You can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions: You are pregnant or planning to get pregnant There is an implanted medical device in the body You have a history of seizures There is brain damage from past injury or illness You suffer from frequent headaches To ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the common side effects associated with TMS treatment for depression?","gold":"TMS is not associated with systemic side effects from drugs in the bloodstream.

Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.” The “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.” As aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist. He’ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper’s new attempt at Cole’s attention in the video below.

(Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?","gold":"The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars.

Mariah Timms, USA Today Network-Tennessee The Nashville Weather Service predicts Sunday will be partly sunny, then gradually becoming sunny, with a high near 53. Overnight, the low may drop below freezing before swinging up to a sunny, low-50s Monday. The sun will be out, but rain runoff will still be moving through the area. Water-covered roadways are dangerous even in daylight. Rivers to remain high, at flood potential Several rivers remain under a flood warning until Tuesday night as swollen waterways continue in the area after a record-breaking amount of rainfall in February. \"Water is going to be slow to go down,\" Rose said. Rivers, especially, are \"not going to drop as fast as places that get flash flooded.\" The Harpeth and Cumberland Rivers will be under flood warnings until Tuesday night at several points in Davidson County. Browns Creek reached minor flooding stage Saturday night after heavy rain. The NWS lists five stages of flooding on its river forecast map: Major flooding, moderate flooding, minor flooding, near flood stage and no flooding. Moderate flooding was predicted at the Harpeth River near Kingston Springs, Duck River at Columbia and Duck River at Centerville. Both the Cumberland and the Harpeth are expected to reach moderate flood stage, likely impacting greenways and industrial areas along their banks, according to NWS and Metro Nashville Water Services predictions. Flooding likely low-impact Metro Water Services said Saturday it does not anticipate the Cumberland downtown to rise to a level that is a concern to businesses in that area. Businesses or buildings with underground garages or structures should take precautions. The Cumberland River's flood stage is 40 feet in downtown Nashville. On Saturday night, the Cumberland River's water level was at 39.59 feet, according to NWS data. It's expected to hit 43.8 feet by Sunday evening. According to the NWS, at 42 feet, Riverfront Park is flooded to the fourth grassy area, as well as other recreational and greenway areas along the river. Portions of Cowan Street and Cowan Court are flooded and may be impassable. Industrial properties on Davidson Street, North First Street, Cowan Street and Cowan Court are also flooded.

Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com\/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022 Last year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?","gold":"Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs.
