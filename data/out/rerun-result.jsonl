{"id":392,"question":"How does perspektivism relate to moral standrds and ethics?","answer":"Perspectivism, as a philosophical viewpoint, suggests that all concepts, including moral standards, are dependent on the perspective of the individual or community holding them. This means that moral standards and ethics can vary greatly from one culture, society, or individual to another, as they are influenced by personal experiences, cultural norms, historical contexts, and individual beliefs.\n\nThe relationship between perspectivism and moral standards and ethics can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Moral Relativism**: Perspectivism often leads to a form of moral relativism, which is the view that moral judgments are true or false only relative to some particular standpoint (for example, that of a culture or a historical period) and that no standpoint is uniquely privileged over all others. This means that what is considered right or wrong can be different depending on the perspective from which it is viewed.\n\n2. **Cultural Influence**: Different cultures have different ethical systems based on their unique histories, beliefs, and societal needs. Perspectivism acknowledges that these differences are not just random but are shaped by the perspectives inherent in each culture.\n\n3. **Subjective Judgment**: Perspectivism emphasizes that ethical judgments are subjective and influenced by personal experiences and biases. This subjective nature means that what one person considers morally right, another may consider wrong, depending on their personal perspective.\n\n4. **Plurality of Moral Systems**: Because ethics are perspectival, there can be a plurality of moral systems that are all valid within their respective contexts. This doesn't mean that any action is equally valid across all perspectives, but rather that different perspectives can lead to different but equally valid moral conclusions.\n\n5. **Challenges to Absolutism**: Perspectivism challenges the idea of absolute moral standards that are universally applicable. It argues that such absolutes are either unattainable or that they are merely one perspective among many, not necessarily superior or more correct.\n\n6. **Dialogical Ethics**: Perspectivism encourages dialogue and understanding between different moral perspectives. It recognizes that ethical disagreements can be resolved or at least better understood through respectful discussion and the exploration of various viewpoints.\n\n7. **Ethical Development**: Perspectivism suggests that ethical development is a continuous process of refining one's perspective through exposure to diverse viewpoints and experiences. This is in contrast to an absolute or fixed ethical system, where growth is limited by the rigidity of its rules.\n\nIn conclusion, perspectivism posits that moral standards and ethics are deeply influenced by individual and collective perspectives, which can lead to a variety of ethical systems and moral judgments. This view encourages an open-minded approach to ethics, recognizing the value of understanding and respecting diverse perspectives while fostering dialogue and ethical growth.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: But, suffice it to say, it must be a perspective that holds the reality of theology\/ethics, that realizes that moral discernment concerns the “who” moreso than the “what” or “why” (another tidbit gleaned from Jeph), that the Christian is engaged in a community of believers who are called to make things right by engaging in the tasks of the Kingdom, and that Christ is the Lord of Peace, not of envy, strife, anger, hatred, or violence. Many more niceties could be added, but the whole of Christian ethics calls for the Christian to realize that they are a “who” that is called to differentiate from the world and yet love the world, to engage in tension through being within the tensions created daily, to effect change through peace. This is very different from an ethics of autonomy, of individualism, because it assumes that the “who” is engaged within a community and is more than an “I”, a ghost in the machine of the body who is disconnected from the material world, nor is the autonomous self a wholly material entity reduced to chemical determination. How do you look at ethics? Do you realize the interconnectedness of the ethical, or do you think we are just autonomous beings who create our lives completely (in otherwords, beings who are realized through the Now)?\n\nAlright. I have had a bit of a hiatus, mainly due to applying to doctoral programs and the like. So, here is the second part in a series, a transcription of an interview I had with Jeph Holloway, Prof of Ethics, Theology, and Philosophy at ETBU. In this part of the interview we talk about the basis of his work, differences in ethical models, and the problem of contemporary Christian ethics, which too often asks the wrong questions… you be the judge, though :)\nLots of good content here. This is a picture of Dr. Holloway. He is, obviously, communicating vocally. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nT: Ok, Here’s another question, and I think it points toward where you start with the book and the central question, where you work ethics from- and I think it’s highly original. Asking this question about what God is doing about evil is usually taken down different trajectories. So, at what point did you note theodicy as particularly important in the discipline of Christian ethics? J: Well, I think one thing that has helped me give coherence, if there is such in what I’m up to here, to my understanding of what Christian ethics is all about has been the work of N. T. Wright. Now, I’ve been slowly forming this pattern, this narrative that I’m trying to present, that God, through God’s redemptive work, is creating a people, whose lives sustained in worship, bear witness to God’s purpose for creation. I think my explanation of what God is doing about evil is itself a story. It’s a narrative. Or, it is a nutshell presentation of what I think is the narrative of the Bible. And, I have known for about the last twenty years, even before that, even when I was finishing up my own PhD studies in Christian ethics, that I was uncomfortable with what were the prevailing patterns of what I saw in the field of Christian ethics. Before N.T. Wright I will have to say Stanley Hauerwas occasioned that discomfort in my outlook. With Hauerwas’s emphasis on a narrative approach to Christian ethics, that it cannot be, first and foremost, “Well, alright, here’s a situation; what are the norms, standards, rules that pertain to that particular situation”, and then we operate through a deductive process and come out with some right answer to the question, “What should I do?” Hauewas helped me understand that the moral life is not reducible to the operations of the Cartesian cogito, the res cogitans, the “thinking thing” that is operative in an a-historical abstract environment. We are living people whose lives have been shaped by multiple influences that effect how we even interpret the situation we are required to act within. We live in the world in light of the world we live in. And, so, the question is “What world do we live in?” and “How do we see that world?”\nHauerwas will stress the singular importance of “vision”, “perspective”, “perception”, as fundamental to what the moral life is all about. Stanley Hauerwas. Looking bad-ass, per usual. Now, that occasioned a sense of discomfort and dis-ease, and so I couldn’t necessarily explain it clearly back in the late 1980s why I wasn’t so comfortable with the prevailing approaches and models of what Christian ethics is all about. But, understanding that narrative emphasis made certain things I was reading from N.T. Wright resonate with the task of Christian ethics. In Wright’s first volume on the NT and the People of God he will outline what he considers to be the overarching narrative of the Bible as a whole and will relate to that narrative certain basic, what he calls at that point, Worldview Questions: “Where are we?” “Who are we?” “What’s wrong?”. And, that “What’s wrong?” business really evokes the questions of theodicy.\n\nBut I hasten to add that this is not the same thing as trying to quash it or saying it is wrong for those who hold it. You need not even dispute the claims to the critic. You need not go out of your way to defend your views or make the case to others who might scoff (even though their own views may be built upon quicksand). No, the value is that YOU gain a perspective of the truth for YOURSELF, so that YOU can make the case to YOURSELF, so that you don’t allow the old crystallized beliefs to place YOU in self-doubt about pursuing YOUR OWN ideas. This sort of disputation is in line with the purpose of this section–correcting the false beliefs we may hold about ourselves and obtaining a more realistic view of the ones from the outside. Justification For Attack\nWe know that criticism and attack are based in fear. And we know that fear results from the illusion of separation. There are beliefs about such things as work, (the Protestant work ethic), about intolerance of “bad” behavior, about money (it represents evil and greed), patriotism, tradition, etc. In addition, are the pressures to conform. There is the exhortation to defend a host of ideas–honor, good name, mother, family, family values, country, the faith and more. Then there are pressures to be politically one way or another, to criticize secularism and \/ or liberalism as evil, to stand up for what’s right, to stand on principle (in fact to value a strong stance regardless). Many of these calls to stand and to defend are really ruses to attack those holding different ideas. Love or fear? Certainists emphasize absolute moral standards that all must follow. They refer to disregard of them as “relativism”–a prevalent subject, frequently raised in political and religious discourse-and thus worth examining. Absolute Morality vs. Relativism\nThe idea of a good society is something you do not need a religion and eternal punishment to buttress; you need religion if you are terrified of death. -Gore Vidal\nTo begin, the term relativism, is almost always used contemptuously. We might more appropriately refer to those labeled as “relativists”, as non-absolutists; one never hears so-called relativists referring to themselves as such or espousing a moral view that they call relativism. What is meant by the word? Most obviously, it’s portrayed as the flip side of absolutism–the idea of absolute moral standards handed down by an authoritative, rule-obsessed God. Relativism, therefore, is seen as holding that all moral judgements are subjective, i.e., determined by each individual for him \/ herself, and subject to change at any moment. To absolutists, this amounts to no moral values at all. In their opinion, this can only lead to a corrupt and immoral society (Today’s absolutists assert this has been the case since the 1960s). Absolute moral standards are reassuring for those inclined toward certainty for it removes the ambiguity (and ensuing discomfort) of being unclear about what is right or wrong. It’s all prescribed. Consequently, there need not be disagreements over such issues. Having to think and reason and make personal decisions about these matters is not necessary. In addition, objective moral standards allow absolutists to claim for themselves moral righteousness, a justification they utilize to judge and condemn those who fall to temptations and get caught in moral lapses. Absolutists eagerly leap to the task of holding “sinners” accountable, demanding admission of guilt, pleas for forgiveness, public repentance and punishment. Absolutism is a contrivance aimed at controlling other \/ outer. Absolutists have little tolerance of those who can tolerate ambiguity, sneering at non-absolutists whether or not they behave morally and responsibly regardless of obedience to absolutes. Love or fear? When many agree upon static views, one result is a collection of inflexible rules of conduct. So morality becomes a matter of following the rules and evil infringing upon them. There is nothing cosmic or spiritual with this approach. It’s interesting, isn’t it? Certainty about one’s own reality leads to an outer concern about other’s takes upon reality.\n\n- Where do morals come from? - Can a person be moral but not ethical? - What is morally right? - Who determines right or wrong? - What makes something morally right or wrong? - Is the study of what is morally right and wrong? - Does right and wrong exist? - Can a nihilist have morals? - What is it called when someone doesn’t know right from wrong? - What influences us in deciding what is right and wrong? - What is the difference between right and wrong? - Does moral truth exist? - Is it morally wrong to cheat? Where do morals come from? Some people think that our conscience has a divine source, but a humanist might respond that such instincts and emotions have a more natural origin. For humanists, our moral instincts and values don’t come from somewhere outside of humanity. The origins of morality lie inside human beings..\nCan a person be moral but not ethical? Ethics are rules that are recognized by a certain institution. … Someone doesn’t need to be moral to be ethical. There may be someone who has no moral compass but follows ethics to be in good standing with society. On the other hand, someone can violate ethics all the time because they believe something is morally good. What is morally right? 1. The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct: questioned the morality of my actions. 2. A system or collection of ideas of right and wrong conduct: religious morality; Christian morality. Who determines right or wrong? In the end, who determines right and wrong? God does. The moral lawgiver determines the moral laws, and they are written in his Word (Exod. 20) and on our hearts (Rom. What makes something morally right or wrong? According to Moral Foundations Theory, an action may be considered to be wrong because: it is harmful, it is unfair or unjust, it shows disloyalty to a group, it is disrespectful to an authority, or it is impure or gross. Is the study of what is morally right and wrong? Ethics, also called moral philosophy, the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad and morally right and wrong. … The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles. Does right and wrong exist? Even today we don’t all agree on what “right” is. … We treat our ability to distinguish between “right” and “wrong” as gospel despite the fact that “right” and “wrong” has changed so much across time and cultures. That’s because morality — our ability to separate right from wrong — doesn’t really exist. Can a nihilist have morals? Yes, there are ‘moral nihilists’ which believe that there are no moral obligations, and that morals are objective to the person in question. … The two main branches of nihilism are existential nihilism and moral nihilism. The first of which essentially states there is no objective meaning or purpose in the universe. What is it called when someone doesn’t know right from wrong? People who can’t differentiate between right and wrong (have no moral compass) are amoral. Google Definition: adjective. lacking a moral sense; unconcerned with the rightness or wrongness of something. What influences us in deciding what is right and wrong? It is the idea that we know the ethical value of right and wrong by listening to our conscience. That still, small voice inside is what tells us whether something is right or wrong. What is the difference between right and wrong? 1. Doing the right thing is an act that is in accordance with the law, justice, and morality while doing the wrong thing is an act that is not in accordance with morality or the law. 2. The right way is one which is proper, appropriate, and suitable while the wrong way is one which not suitable or appropriate. Does moral truth exist? The most common view among scientists and philosophers is that moral truth does not exist – only moral opinion, and that our ethical “absolutes” merely express our emotions or attitudes of approval and disapproval. … Participants need only familiarize themselves with the Wikipedia versions of their ethical theories. Is it morally wrong to cheat? Cheating morally is a wrong action, because cheating is, as one case of the definition of immoral action, especially in the case of your question;” cheating in tasks in such a way to give you an advantage over others.”That clearly disregarded right of others.\n\nMoral principals or morality is a form of thought, judgment and standards which contains certain information or knowledge about the proper (The Free Dictionary). This Knowledge is functionally subordinated to the main – the regulatory role of standards and this is different from scientific knowledge. At the same time, the rules are not abstract or “pure” formal-logical constructions; they are connected with the reality which exists. Morality is undoubtedly dependent on faith in God in the sense that it interacts with it as well as with other forms of culture – art, science, maybe even closer to science than other. Both morals and religion have a common point of intersection. The words “faith” and “healing” in the Greek language have the same root. Thus, to believe – means to find purpose and meaning in life, to find its place in the world, to see the path leading to this goal that is beyond earthly existence. There are two worldviews: one of them thinks that the world is a huge soulless mechanism that was unleashed forth by an unknown entity. On one of the dust specks of this huge conglomerate of celestial bodies that was accidentally originated is a phenomenon called life. The combination of atoms and molecules that has received the ability to transmit their structural plan of the other systems, they brought us a surprise. Immortality is not (Religion and Morality. The God Delusion. Richard Dawkins). Life is like a spark flared up in the darkness of cosmic night, it fades and disappears, a man born akin to be aware of his impending doom, weakness and the meaninglessness of life; born to join death and no return towards consciousness with a permanent feeling of eternal fade into the darkness of grave which is the abyss of nothingness. This deeply pessimistic outlook does not provide the makes of moral ideas and volitional incentives, it only promises to man an illusory freedom which takes away any sense of responsibility for their lives lived. If life is random and meaningless, then to whom and for what is man accountable? If a person is just a structural connection of atoms and molecules, controlled by bio-currents, then who is he to love; A Bio-machine? To whom shall we bear our moral responsibility? Despite the argument, do not attribute the thought that all atheists are immoral and unprincipled men, but one has to think that atheism has no relation to morals. If an atheist is moral, it is because he has learned the behavior of the highest, eternal, innate law of justice, which he rejects with all of his intellect, but his heart feels the instinct to life and proper and moral conduct. Religion is not morality; it is foundation for moral and ethical principles. One can have faith absent from his life and be a decent person. This simple idea is very difficult to accept for critics from secular civilization, although in this case it is difficult to say what exactly is expressed in practice the spiritual crisis of this civilization. If one is to reformulate the original question, taking into account adjustments made, it looks purely rhetorical. For the answer is quite obvious and indisputable: morality, regardless of religion is possible. There were whole epochs and nations that had huge moral achievements even during the pagan period in its history. The most glaring example would be Ancient Greece, within the culture which crystallized cardinal virtues of temperance, courage, justice, wisdom was formulated the golden rule of morality and developed the concept of ethics. All this is the priceless heritage of humanity, fully retains its value so far. Furthermore, the golden rule of morality formulates the first civilizations independently of each other. This principle is to be found among the sayings of ancient sages, Buddha, Confucius, and Thales. In the most general form of this rule is as follows: (Do not) Do unto others as you (do not) would like them to do unto you. This rule represents the society as a set of equal people and halts the divide between “us against them”. Considering the objective content of human feelings, ideas, concepts, judgments, conclusions, theories and proven public practice, Lenn Goodman would be correct in arguing for certain things remaining in the wrong. Unanimity, one could fear as well, is no proper standard of moral universality.\n\nSimilar positions exist in many religious sects, although it may not be as reified as the Catholic Pope. And this raises the question of the standards that are being used to control the selection and interpretation of the Word of God. Given the plethora of religious sects that exist around the world, one has to ask how they are picking the portions of text that they choose to sanctify. What separates the Sunis from the Shias, the Baptists from the Methodists, the Orthodox from the Modern? Is there a hidden standard of \"Right\" and \"Good\" at work here, independent of the written word? A third problem stems from the fact that even though \"God said it! I believe it!\" you can still ask yourself \"Why be Moral?\" -- \"Why should I follow God's commands?\" Even if I am a devout believer in the existence of God, what reason do I have to follow God's commands. Even if God is the Creator of the Universe (and so forth), why should I follow Her commands? Why is creating the Universe (and so forth) worthy of my respect and worship? And (assuming that question is answered to your satisfaction) how does respect and worship translate into unquestioning obedience to God's commands? According to the theory, God created us \"in his own image\". But surely that means that She endowed us with the ability to reason and the power of foresight. Why should I ignore those God-given talents, and blindly follow her commands? Now, the obvious first-approximation answer to that challenge is that it is in my own self-interest. That is why all formal religions incorporate some concept of Heaven and Hell (to use the standard Christian labels) -- good little boys and girls wind up in Heaven, while bad little boys and girls wind up in Hell. But this answer confuses the deontological nature of Divine Command Ethics with some form of Consequentialist ethics. If you are worried about your self-interest, then you are not undertaking moral obligations because they arise from God's commands. You are obeying God's commands with the same motivation as you obey the local traffic laws. So what now separates God's Commands from the laws of the local legislature? And if you do not consider your own self-interest when contemplating God's commands, then the question returns at a deeper level -- \"Why be Moral?\" The forth problem for Divine Command Ethics was identified by Socrates circa 399 BC. The \"Euthyphro Dilemma\" is found in Plato's Euthyphro dialogue, in which Socrates asks Euthyphro, \"Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\" In modern parlance -- is an action right (morally obligatory) because it is commanded by God, or has God commanded it because it is right (morally obligatory)? If one accepts the first horn of the dilemma, (the position commonly known as Theological Voluntarism(4)) then one is accepting that God's commands can be arbitrary and capricious, adhering to no other standard of right and wrong than God's whimsy. It is then possible (and in fact highly likely, given a superficial reading of the Bible) that God's commands are totally arbitrary, without any necessary foundation, and may possibly and acceptably be mutually inconsistent, contradictory, and conflicting. If one accepts the other horn of the dilemma, on the other hand, then one is accepting that there exists a standard of rightness and morality that is independent of God's commands. On the one hand, God might command things that we intuitively think are obnoxious (and a selective reading of the Bible would cerrtainly reinforce that conclusion). On the other hand, if we can study and learn about that external standard of right, then what do we need God for? Obviously, neither horn of this dilemma is attractive to adherents of Divine Command Ethics. If one tries to avoid the dilemma by arguing that God's very nature is the standard of good, or value, or justice -- then one is accepting that the statement \"God is good\" is equivalent to the statement \"God is approved of by God\" -- a meaningless tautology and not an appealing alternative either.\n\nThe Changing Moral Imperative:\nFrom gods to God to Gaia. Ethics without God: exploring a secular basis for our ethics\nAn address to the 2010 National Conference of SOFiA in Australia by Lloyd Geering\nHow do we know what is right and wrong behaviour? We first learn this distinction from our parents and teachers. They pass on to us their own current values and also their criteria for judging what is right behaviour. Between the ages of two and three we seem to develop a concern for what is fair. ‘That’s not fair!’ is a frequent complaint of a four-year old. It’s as if we humans come into this world already morally programmed. Thus, even before we are old enough to develop any critical thinking of an ethical nature it we have already been shaped, partly by our internal psyche but mostly by the conditioning we receive from others. Those who teach us, of course, have in turn been shaped, first by their parents and then by the culture in which they were brought up. We are all shaped by human culture. In modern times we may try to transcend the particular culture into which we were born but we can never extricate ourselves from human culture in general. We live in it as fish live in the sea. When we pass through adolescence on the way to maturity we begin to question what we are told and we either modify, or accept as our own, the values and criteria that have been handed to us. That is all part of the process of ‘coming of age’ and learning to take our responsible place in society. In such ways every human culture, in the course of its evolution, has developed the customs or moral rules deemed to be necessary for the harmony and well-being of the group. Our words ‘morality’ and ‘ethics’ come respectively from the Latin and Greek words mores and ethos that referred, respectively, to the established cultural customs of Rome and Greece. All specific cultures have been evolving like this from time immemorial. Now let us look at this evolutionary process on the much longer time scale. Just as we, as individuals, pass through a maturing process as we ‘come of age’, so, in the last three centuries, this same process has been occurring in human culture on the grand scale. Dietrich Bonhoeffer even referred to it as ‘mankind’s coming age’. How did this happen? The period known as the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century has proved to be an irreversible threshold of cultural change that is now affecting all cultures on a global scale. Unfortunately the significance of the Enlightenment is still not widely understood and appreciated, with the result that at the popular level many still assume that the pre-Enlightenment conditions still obtain. This is particularly the case in traditional Christian, Jewish and Muslim circles. In each of these, the moral laws inherited from the past are still regarded as eternal and unchangeable, and hence not to be questioned. Let me briefly explain. In pre-Enlightenment Christendom it was taught by the church, and accepted without question, that the standards of right and wrong originated with God. He had ordained them and he had revealed them to humans. For the Jew they were set out in the Torah, for the Christian in the Bible and for the Muslim in the Qur’an. The divine laws were specifically to be found in such statements as The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. But in each tradition, by exploring the rest of their Holy Scriptures, scholars in the course of time constructed quite complex ethical Codes of behaviour that carried the stamp of divine authority. The Jews, for example, found 613 specific commandments. The Muslim assembled the Shariah. Christian theologians called it Christian Ethics; this they expounded on the basis of what they found in the Bible. All of these ethical codes were regarded as being set in stone and not open to debate. It was sufficient for the Church to say: ‘The Bible teaches…’ and that was the end of the matter. Nietzsche called this form of learning right behaviour ‘slave morality’. Just recall how we used to learn both morality and the Christian truths by memorising the catechism. Indeed, the use of the catechism as a means of instruction in religion and morals was only disappearing in my childhood days. But we no longer simply repeat, like a ventriloquist’s dummy, what others put into our mouths!\n\nby Matt Slick\nI often receive complaints from atheists about the God of Christianity. They accuse him of being a monster and a moral tyrant. They just don't like him. Apparently, there isn't enough room in the world for two moral judges: God and themselves. So, they want to dismiss God and judge him. Okay, so what gives them to right to judge God? Where is their standard from which they base their moral assertions about what is right and wrong? The problem is that they can't produce any objective standard. They only have their subjective opinions, and that is a problem--a big problem. Now, just because they have a dilemma on their hands about rationally and morally justifying any sort of standard of righteousness by which they can make moral judgments, it doesn't mean they are going to give up their moral self-righteousness (isn't that what it is?) when someone shows them the irrationality door and firmly escorts their rears through it. After all, when you get to play God and make yourself the moral standard of right and wrong, that is hard to give up. I'm sure there's some internal satisfaction that permeates the atheist's soul when declaring what is good and bad and then passing judgment on others. The problem is that no atheist I've encountered has been able to provide a rational justification for his moral judgments. Let's just take a look at their dilemma. You see, if an atheist wants to complain about the God of the Bible, that is his privilege. I will defend his right to have an opinion--even such a stupendously wrong one. But what logical argument can an atheist provide that would justify him saying that anything God does really is wrong? Think about it. The atheist could only have three possible options for the source of a moral standard:\n- He can develop a moral standard out of his own opinions. - He can adopt the moral standards of society. - He can use a combination of his own opinions and the morals of society. Other than those three, I don't see any other options. So, let's take a look at them. Deriving morality from one's own opinions\nIf an atheist wants to develop his moral standard based on his own opinions, then what justifies his opinions as being the right ones? His opinions are subjective--not objective. They are based on his opinions so why should we take his moral opinions seriously? And what right does he have to say that anyone else's moral position is right or wrong? Isn't their opinion on morals as valid as his? Furthermore, if he tried to say that anyone else's morals were wrong, then isn't he being arrogant by judging another's subjective opinions based on his subjective opinions? These questions expose the problem of deriving morality from one's self. Deriving morality from society\nIf we go with the second option where the atheist derives his morality from society, then what makes one society right and another wrong? Haven't societies been wrong before? Think of Nazi Germany or America in the 1800's regarding slavery. Furthermore, who's to say that in the future a new moral majority might condemn atheism as an ethical danger to society? Would they be right? How would you know? The point is that deriving morality from society doesn't mean it is correct. History has shown that to be the case. Many atheists respond to this criticism by saying that society is evolving and getting better morally. Okay, but that is just begging the question. In other words, they are saying society is getting better morally because we are evolving. Really? In other words, societies are getting better morally because societies say so? Deriving morality from opinions and society\nFinally, if the atheist uses his own opinions in combination with those of society, then he is subjectively deciding what he thinks is right and wrong in the society around him. He is judging society's morals and deciding which ones are right and wrong, which ultimately brings us back to the first problem where he's deriving morality from his own opinions. He's logically befuddled. So, the atheist doesn't seem to have a leg to stand on when it comes to making moral assertions and actually defending them as being the right ones.\n\nMoral and Ethical Issues\nJust war principles. Procedures for ethical dissent. Ethical climate assessment survey. Section I Ethics and the Role of Army Values\nEthics is the area of moral philosophy that seeks to establish an\nenduring standard of right and wrong conduct. With such a standard,\none is able to recognize the differences between right and wrong (in a\ngiven situation) and do the right thing. Chaplains recognize that soldiers and leaders bring a value system\ninto the Army rooted in their family upbringing, culture, religion,\neducation, experience, and a host of other factors. Army values are\nthe standards for right and wrong in the U.S. Army. Actions that are\nin accord with loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity,\nand personal courage are right. Actions that undercut these values are\nwrong. Army values include obeying the UCMJ, but require\ncommitment, discipline, and integrity beyond the letter of the law to\nthe heart of the soldier. Army values form the standard that judges all\nArmy actions and decisions as either right or wrong. When values the\nsoldier brings into the Army support enduring American values and\nthe Army values, encourage their development and application. When\nsoldiers' values are inconsistent with the Army's, guide soldiers to\nreexamine and adjust their values or help them realize that they may\nbe discharged from the Army for not supporting the essential core of\na values based Army. As religious leaders, chaplains recognize that Army values support\npersonal faith in God. The Army value of integrity means living by\none's faith. It does not mean violating one's personal moral beliefs. 10 May 2005\n\nVedanta ethics and moral virtues are rooted in the ideal of realizing and manifesting our own innate divinity. Simply put, whatever brings us closer to that goal is ethical and moral; whatever prevents us from attaining it, is not. Like a diamond buried in mud, the Atman shines within us, yet its presence remains obscured, its shining purity masked by countless layers of ignorance: wrong identification, incorrect knowledge, misguided perceptions. It is important to emphasize that we are not trying to become something other than what we already are. We are not trying to become pure; we are pure. We are not trying to become perfect; we are perfect already. That is our real nature. Acting in accordance with our real nature—acting nobly, truthfully, kindly—tears away the veil of ignorance that hides the truth of reality. Whatever distorts this reality is a perversion of the truth. The whole of Vedanta ethics, then, is based upon a simple line of reasoning: Does this action or thought bring me closer to realizing the truth, or does it take me further away? Morality and the Ego\nWhat is it that prevents us from realizing the truth? Simply put, the ego: the sense of “I” and “mine.” As the great spiritual teacher Ramakrishna said, “The feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ has covered the Reality so we don’t see the truth.” He further said, “When the ego dies, all troubles cease.”\nWhat does the ego have to do with ethics and morality? Absolutely everything. All moral codes are based upon the ideal of unselfishness: placing others before ourselves, forcing the ego to play second fiddle. Following selfish desires is always a detriment to our spiritual life. Whether the action or thought is great or small, any selfishness will make the veil of ignorance thicker and darker. Conversely, any act of unselfishness, however great or small, will have the opposite effect. It is for this reason that doing good to others is a universal ethical and moral code, found in all religions and societies. Why is this so universal? Because it reflects the truth that we instinctively intuit: the oneness of life. Love, sympathy, and empathy are the affirmation of this truth; they are a reflexive response because they mirror the reality of the universe. When we feel love and sympathy we are verifying—albeit unconsciously—the oneness that already exists. When we feel hatred, anger, and jealousy we separate ourselves from others and deny our real nature which is infinite and free from limitations. What is the root of the problem here? Our wrong identification: thinking of ourselves as minds and bodies rather than infinite Spirit. As Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna’s great disciple, said: “As soon as I think that I am a little body, I want to preserve it, to protect it, to keep it nice, at the expense of other bodies; then you and I become separate. As soon as this idea of separation comes, it opens the door to all mischief and leads to all misery.”\nThe Point of Moral Virtues\nAll the moral virtues taught by Vedanta serve to remind us of our real nature, and no spiritual progress can be made without following them. Any attempt to do so would be like trying to build a house without a foundation. Before we even begin to think about how to realize the ultimate truth, we first need to build the groundwork of a real life, one based on real values. Spiritual life is not a haphazard affair: it is the most serious task that we shall ever face. And it is absolutely impossible to do so without living an ethical, moral life. It simply does not work. If Vedanta lays such stress on an ethical life, what, then, are the virtues we emphasize? Patanjali, one of the ancient sages of India and the father of its psychology, formulated standards of moral conduct which have been followed for thousands of years. These precepts function as spiritual tools, tools that can be used to create spiritually beneficial habits. These tools aren’t goals that can be instantly achieved—they are ideals to strive for, patterns to emulate. Still, it’s good to remember that when we do use these tools, we grow in strength and move closer to our ideal.\n\nQuestion:How does perspectivism relate to moral standards and ethics?","passages":[{"passage":"But, suffice it to say, it must be a perspective that holds the reality of theology\/ethics, that realizes that moral discernment concerns the “who” moreso than the “what” or “why” (another tidbit gleaned from Jeph), that the Christian is engaged in a community of believers who are called to make things right by engaging in the tasks of the Kingdom, and that Christ is the Lord of Peace, not of envy, strife, anger, hatred, or violence. Many more niceties could be added, but the whole of Christian ethics calls for the Christian to realize that they are a “who” that is called to differentiate from the world and yet love the world, to engage in tension through being within the tensions created daily, to effect change through peace. This is very different from an ethics of autonomy, of individualism, because it assumes that the “who” is engaged within a community and is more than an “I”, a ghost in the machine of the body who is disconnected from the material world, nor is the autonomous self a wholly material entity reduced to chemical determination.

I have had a bit of a hiatus, mainly due to applying to doctoral programs and the like. So, here is the second part in a series, a transcription of an interview I had with Jeph Holloway, Prof of Ethics, Theology, and Philosophy at ETBU. In this part of the interview we talk about the basis of his work, differences in ethical models, and the problem of contemporary Christian ethics, which too often asks the wrong questions… you be the judge, though :)\nLots of good content here.

Asking this question about what God is doing about evil is usually taken down different trajectories. So, at what point did you note theodicy as particularly important in the discipline of Christian ethics? J: Well, I think one thing that has helped me give coherence, if there is such in what I’m up to here, to my understanding of what Christian ethics is all about has been the work of N. T. Wright. Now, I’ve been slowly forming this pattern, this narrative that I’m trying to present, that God, through God’s redemptive work, is creating a people, whose lives sustained in worship, bear witness to God’s purpose for creation. I think my explanation of what God is doing about evil is itself a story. It’s a narrative. Or, it is a nutshell presentation of what I think is the narrative of the Bible. And, I have known for about the last twenty years, even before that, even when I was finishing up my own PhD studies in Christian ethics, that I was uncomfortable with what were the prevailing patterns of what I saw in the field of Christian ethics. Before N.T. Wright I will have to say Stanley Hauerwas occasioned that discomfort in my outlook. With Hauerwas’s emphasis on a narrative approach to Christian ethics, that it cannot be, first and foremost, “Well, alright, here’s a situation; what are the norms, standards, rules that pertain to that particular situation”, and then we operate through a deductive process and come out with some right answer to the question, “What should I do?” Hauewas helped me understand that the moral life is not reducible to the operations of the Cartesian cogito, the res cogitans, the “thinking thing” that is operative in an a-historical abstract environment. We are living people whose lives have been shaped by multiple influences that effect how we even interpret the situation we are required to act within. We live in the world in light of the world we live in. And, so, the question is “What world do we live in?” and “How do we see that world?”\nHauerwas will stress the singular importance of “vision”, “perspective”, “perception”, as fundamental to what the moral life is all about. Stanley Hauerwas. Looking bad-ass, per usual. Now, that occasioned a sense of discomfort and dis-ease, and so I couldn’t necessarily explain it clearly back in the late 1980s why I wasn’t so comfortable with the prevailing approaches and models of what Christian ethics is all about. But, understanding that narrative emphasis made certain things I was reading from N.T. Wright resonate with the task of Christian ethics. In Wright’s first volume on the NT and the People of God he will outline what he considers to be the overarching narrative of the Bible as a whole and will relate to that narrative certain basic, what he calls at that point, Worldview Questions: “Where are we?” “Who are we?” “What’s wrong?”.

You need not even dispute the claims to the critic. You need not go out of your way to defend your views or make the case to others who might scoff (even though their own views may be built upon quicksand). No, the value is that YOU gain a perspective of the truth for YOURSELF, so that YOU can make the case to YOURSELF, so that you don’t allow the old crystallized beliefs to place YOU in self-doubt about pursuing YOUR OWN ideas. This sort of disputation is in line with the purpose of this section–correcting the false beliefs we may hold about ourselves and obtaining a more realistic view of the ones from the outside. Justification For Attack\nWe know that criticism and attack are based in fear. And we know that fear results from the illusion of separation. There are beliefs about such things as work, (the Protestant work ethic), about intolerance of “bad” behavior, about money (it represents evil and greed), patriotism, tradition, etc. In addition, are the pressures to conform. There is the exhortation to defend a host of ideas–honor, good name, mother, family, family values, country, the faith and more. Then there are pressures to be politically one way or another, to criticize secularism and \/ or liberalism as evil, to stand up for what’s right, to stand on principle (in fact to value a strong stance regardless). Many of these calls to stand and to defend are really ruses to attack those holding different ideas. Love or fear? Certainists emphasize absolute moral standards that all must follow. They refer to disregard of them as “relativism”–a prevalent subject, frequently raised in political and religious discourse-and thus worth examining. Absolute Morality vs. Relativism\nThe idea of a good society is something you do not need a religion and eternal punishment to buttress; you need religion if you are terrified of death. -Gore Vidal\nTo begin, the term relativism, is almost always used contemptuously. We might more appropriately refer to those labeled as “relativists”, as non-absolutists; one never hears so-called relativists referring to themselves as such or espousing a moral view that they call relativism. What is meant by the word? Most obviously, it’s portrayed as the flip side of absolutism–the idea of absolute moral standards handed down by an authoritative, rule-obsessed God. Relativism, therefore, is seen as holding that all moral judgements are subjective, i.e., determined by each individual for him \/ herself, and subject to change at any moment. To absolutists, this amounts to no moral values at all. In their opinion, this can only lead to a corrupt and immoral society (Today’s absolutists assert this has been the case since the 1960s). Absolute moral standards are reassuring for those inclined toward certainty for it removes the ambiguity (and ensuing discomfort) of being unclear about what is right or wrong. It’s all prescribed. Consequently, there need not be disagreements over such issues. Having to think and reason and make personal decisions about these matters is not necessary. In addition, objective moral standards allow absolutists to claim for themselves moral righteousness, a justification they utilize to judge and condemn those who fall to temptations and get caught in moral lapses. Absolutists eagerly leap to the task of holding “sinners” accountable, demanding admission of guilt, pleas for forgiveness, public repentance and punishment. Absolutism is a contrivance aimed at controlling other \/ outer. Absolutists have little tolerance of those who can tolerate ambiguity, sneering at non-absolutists whether or not they behave morally and responsibly regardless of obedience to absolutes. Love or fear? When many agree upon static views, one result is a collection of inflexible rules of conduct. So morality becomes a matter of following the rules and evil infringing upon them. There is nothing cosmic or spiritual with this approach. It’s interesting, isn’t it? Certainty about one’s own reality leads to an outer concern about other’s takes upon reality.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9ce605f3-84ff-48a7-bd33-74e8d13c9337>"]},{"passage":"- Where do morals come from? - Can a person be moral but not ethical? - What is morally right? - Who determines right or wrong? - What makes something morally right or wrong? - Is the study of what is morally right and wrong? - Does right and wrong exist? - Can a nihilist have morals? - What is it called when someone doesn’t know right from wrong? - What influences us in deciding what is right and wrong? - What is the difference between right and wrong? - Does moral truth exist? - Is it morally wrong to cheat?

Ethics are rules that are recognized by a certain institution. … Someone doesn’t need to be moral to be ethical. There may be someone who has no moral compass but follows ethics to be in good standing with society. On the other hand, someone can violate ethics all the time because they believe something is morally good. What is morally right? 1.

The moral lawgiver determines the moral laws, and they are written in his Word (Exod. 20) and on our hearts (Rom. What makes something morally right or wrong? According to Moral Foundations Theory, an action may be considered to be wrong because: it is harmful, it is unfair or unjust, it shows disloyalty to a group, it is disrespectful to an authority, or it is impure or gross. Is the study of what is morally right and wrong? Ethics, also called moral philosophy, the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad and morally right and wrong. … The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles. Does right and wrong exist? Even today we don’t all agree on what “right” is. … We treat our ability to distinguish between “right” and “wrong” as gospel despite the fact that “right” and “wrong” has changed so much across time and cultures. That’s because morality — our ability to separate right from wrong — doesn’t really exist. Can a nihilist have morals? Yes, there are ‘moral nihilists’ which believe that there are no moral obligations, and that morals are objective to the person in question. … The two main branches of nihilism are existential nihilism and moral nihilism.

Google Definition: adjective. lacking a moral sense; unconcerned with the rightness or wrongness of something. What influences us in deciding what is right and wrong? It is the idea that we know the ethical value of right and wrong by listening to our conscience. That still, small voice inside is what tells us whether something is right or wrong. What is the difference between right and wrong? 1. Doing the right thing is an act that is in accordance with the law, justice, and morality while doing the wrong thing is an act that is not in accordance with morality or the law. 2. The right way is one which is proper, appropriate, and suitable while the wrong way is one which not suitable or appropriate. Does moral truth exist?

This Knowledge is functionally subordinated to the main – the regulatory role of standards and this is different from scientific knowledge. At the same time, the rules are not abstract or “pure” formal-logical constructions; they are connected with the reality which exists. Morality is undoubtedly dependent on faith in God in the sense that it interacts with it as well as with other forms of culture – art, science, maybe even closer to science than other. Both morals and religion have a common point of intersection. The words “faith” and “healing” in the Greek language have the same root. Thus, to believe – means to find purpose and meaning in life, to find its place in the world, to see the path leading to this goal that is beyond earthly existence. There are two worldviews: one of them thinks that the world is a huge soulless mechanism that was unleashed forth by an unknown entity. On one of the dust specks of this huge conglomerate of celestial bodies that was accidentally originated is a phenomenon called life. The combination of atoms and molecules that has received the ability to transmit their structural plan of the other systems, they brought us a surprise. Immortality is not (Religion and Morality. The God Delusion. Richard Dawkins). Life is like a spark flared up in the darkness of cosmic night, it fades and disappears, a man born akin to be aware of his impending doom, weakness and the meaninglessness of life; born to join death and no return towards consciousness with a permanent feeling of eternal fade into the darkness of grave which is the abyss of nothingness. This deeply pessimistic outlook does not provide the makes of moral ideas and volitional incentives, it only promises to man an illusory freedom which takes away any sense of responsibility for their lives lived. If life is random and meaningless, then to whom and for what is man accountable? If a person is just a structural connection of atoms and molecules, controlled by bio-currents, then who is he to love; A Bio-machine? To whom shall we bear our moral responsibility? Despite the argument, do not attribute the thought that all atheists are immoral and unprincipled men, but one has to think that atheism has no relation to morals. If an atheist is moral, it is because he has learned the behavior of the highest, eternal, innate law of justice, which he rejects with all of his intellect, but his heart feels the instinct to life and proper and moral conduct. Religion is not morality; it is foundation for moral and ethical principles. One can have faith absent from his life and be a decent person. This simple idea is very difficult to accept for critics from secular civilization, although in this case it is difficult to say what exactly is expressed in practice the spiritual crisis of this civilization. If one is to reformulate the original question, taking into account adjustments made, it looks purely rhetorical. For the answer is quite obvious and indisputable: morality, regardless of religion is possible. There were whole epochs and nations that had huge moral achievements even during the pagan period in its history. The most glaring example would be Ancient Greece, within the culture which crystallized cardinal virtues of temperance, courage, justice, wisdom was formulated the golden rule of morality and developed the concept of ethics. All this is the priceless heritage of humanity, fully retains its value so far. Furthermore, the golden rule of morality formulates the first civilizations independently of each other. This principle is to be found among the sayings of ancient sages, Buddha, Confucius, and Thales. In the most general form of this rule is as follows: (Do not) Do unto others as you (do not) would like them to do unto you. This rule represents the society as a set of equal people and halts the divide between “us against them”.

And this raises the question of the standards that are being used to control the selection and interpretation of the Word of God. Given the plethora of religious sects that exist around the world, one has to ask how they are picking the portions of text that they choose to sanctify. What separates the Sunis from the Shias, the Baptists from the Methodists, the Orthodox from the Modern? Is there a hidden standard of \"Right\" and \"Good\" at work here, independent of the written word? A third problem stems from the fact that even though \"God said it! I believe it!\" you can still ask yourself \"Why be Moral?\" -- \"Why should I follow God's commands?\" Even if I am a devout believer in the existence of God, what reason do I have to follow God's commands. Even if God is the Creator of the Universe (and so forth), why should I follow Her commands? Why is creating the Universe (and so forth) worthy of my respect and worship? And (assuming that question is answered to your satisfaction) how does respect and worship translate into unquestioning obedience to God's commands? According to the theory, God created us \"in his own image\". But surely that means that She endowed us with the ability to reason and the power of foresight. Why should I ignore those God-given talents, and blindly follow her commands? Now, the obvious first-approximation answer to that challenge is that it is in my own self-interest. That is why all formal religions incorporate some concept of Heaven and Hell (to use the standard Christian labels) -- good little boys and girls wind up in Heaven, while bad little boys and girls wind up in Hell. But this answer confuses the deontological nature of Divine Command Ethics with some form of Consequentialist ethics. If you are worried about your self-interest, then you are not undertaking moral obligations because they arise from God's commands. You are obeying God's commands with the same motivation as you obey the local traffic laws. So what now separates God's Commands from the laws of the local legislature? And if you do not consider your own self-interest when contemplating God's commands, then the question returns at a deeper level -- \"Why be Moral?\" The forth problem for Divine Command Ethics was identified by Socrates circa 399 BC. The \"Euthyphro Dilemma\" is found in Plato's Euthyphro dialogue, in which Socrates asks Euthyphro, \"Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\" In modern parlance -- is an action right (morally obligatory) because it is commanded by God, or has God commanded it because it is right (morally obligatory)? If one accepts the first horn of the dilemma, (the position commonly known as Theological Voluntarism(4)) then one is accepting that God's commands can be arbitrary and capricious, adhering to no other standard of right and wrong than God's whimsy. It is then possible (and in fact highly likely, given a superficial reading of the Bible) that God's commands are totally arbitrary, without any necessary foundation, and may possibly and acceptably be mutually inconsistent, contradictory, and conflicting. If one accepts the other horn of the dilemma, on the other hand, then one is accepting that there exists a standard of rightness and morality that is independent of God's commands. On the one hand, God might command things that we intuitively think are obnoxious (and a selective reading of the Bible would cerrtainly reinforce that conclusion). On the other hand, if we can study and learn about that external standard of right, then what do we need God for? Obviously, neither horn of this dilemma is attractive to adherents of Divine Command Ethics. If one tries to avoid the dilemma by arguing that God's very nature is the standard of good, or value, or justice -- then one is accepting that the statement \"God is good\" is equivalent to the statement \"God is approved of by God\" -- a meaningless tautology and not an appealing alternative either.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a2b1fc2e-676f-4765-9a70-50741beb68c5>"]},{"passage":"The Changing Moral Imperative:\nFrom gods to God to Gaia. Ethics without God: exploring a secular basis for our ethics\nAn address to the 2010 National Conference of SOFiA in Australia by Lloyd Geering\nHow do we know what is right and wrong behaviour? We first learn this distinction from our parents and teachers. They pass on to us their own current values and also their criteria for judging what is right behaviour. Between the ages of two and three we seem to develop a concern for what is fair. ‘That’s not fair!’ is a frequent complaint of a four-year old. It’s as if we humans come into this world already morally programmed. Thus, even before we are old enough to develop any critical thinking of an ethical nature it we have already been shaped, partly by our internal psyche but mostly by the conditioning we receive from others. Those who teach us, of course, have in turn been shaped, first by their parents and then by the culture in which they were brought up. We are all shaped by human culture. In modern times we may try to transcend the particular culture into which we were born but we can never extricate ourselves from human culture in general. We live in it as fish live in the sea. When we pass through adolescence on the way to maturity we begin to question what we are told and we either modify, or accept as our own, the values and criteria that have been handed to us. That is all part of the process of ‘coming of age’ and learning to take our responsible place in society. In such ways every human culture, in the course of its evolution, has developed the customs or moral rules deemed to be necessary for the harmony and well-being of the group. Our words ‘morality’ and ‘ethics’ come respectively from the Latin and Greek words mores and ethos that referred, respectively, to the established cultural customs of Rome and Greece. All specific cultures have been evolving like this from time immemorial. Now let us look at this evolutionary process on the much longer time scale. Just as we, as individuals, pass through a maturing process as we ‘come of age’, so, in the last three centuries, this same process has been occurring in human culture on the grand scale. Dietrich Bonhoeffer even referred to it as ‘mankind’s coming age’. How did this happen? The period known as the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century has proved to be an irreversible threshold of cultural change that is now affecting all cultures on a global scale. Unfortunately the significance of the Enlightenment is still not widely understood and appreciated, with the result that at the popular level many still assume that the pre-Enlightenment conditions still obtain. This is particularly the case in traditional Christian, Jewish and Muslim circles. In each of these, the moral laws inherited from the past are still regarded as eternal and unchangeable, and hence not to be questioned. Let me briefly explain. In pre-Enlightenment Christendom it was taught by the church, and accepted without question, that the standards of right and wrong originated with God. He had ordained them and he had revealed them to humans. For the Jew they were set out in the Torah, for the Christian in the Bible and for the Muslim in the Qur’an. The divine laws were specifically to be found in such statements as The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. But in each tradition, by exploring the rest of their Holy Scriptures, scholars in the course of time constructed quite complex ethical Codes of behaviour that carried the stamp of divine authority. The Jews, for example, found 613 specific commandments. The Muslim assembled the Shariah. Christian theologians called it Christian Ethics; this they expounded on the basis of what they found in the Bible. All of these ethical codes were regarded as being set in stone and not open to debate. It was sufficient for the Church to say: ‘The Bible teaches…’ and that was the end of the matter. Nietzsche called this form of learning right behaviour ‘slave morality’. Just recall how we used to learn both morality and the Christian truths by memorising the catechism. Indeed, the use of the catechism as a means of instruction in religion and morals was only disappearing in my childhood days.

They accuse him of being a monster and a moral tyrant. They just don't like him. Apparently, there isn't enough room in the world for two moral judges: God and themselves. So, they want to dismiss God and judge him. Okay, so what gives them to right to judge God? Where is their standard from which they base their moral assertions about what is right and wrong? The problem is that they can't produce any objective standard. They only have their subjective opinions, and that is a problem--a big problem. Now, just because they have a dilemma on their hands about rationally and morally justifying any sort of standard of righteousness by which they can make moral judgments, it doesn't mean they are going to give up their moral self-righteousness (isn't that what it is?) when someone shows them the irrationality door and firmly escorts their rears through it. After all, when you get to play God and make yourself the moral standard of right and wrong, that is hard to give up. I'm sure there's some internal satisfaction that permeates the atheist's soul when declaring what is good and bad and then passing judgment on others. The problem is that no atheist I've encountered has been able to provide a rational justification for his moral judgments. Let's just take a look at their dilemma. You see, if an atheist wants to complain about the God of the Bible, that is his privilege. I will defend his right to have an opinion--even such a stupendously wrong one. But what logical argument can an atheist provide that would justify him saying that anything God does really is wrong? Think about it. The atheist could only have three possible options for the source of a moral standard:\n- He can develop a moral standard out of his own opinions. - He can adopt the moral standards of society. - He can use a combination of his own opinions and the morals of society. Other than those three, I don't see any other options. So, let's take a look at them. Deriving morality from one's own opinions\nIf an atheist wants to develop his moral standard based on his own opinions, then what justifies his opinions as being the right ones? His opinions are subjective--not objective. They are based on his opinions so why should we take his moral opinions seriously? And what right does he have to say that anyone else's moral position is right or wrong? Isn't their opinion on morals as valid as his? Furthermore, if he tried to say that anyone else's morals were wrong, then isn't he being arrogant by judging another's subjective opinions based on his subjective opinions? These questions expose the problem of deriving morality from one's self. Deriving morality from society\nIf we go with the second option where the atheist derives his morality from society, then what makes one society right and another wrong? Haven't societies been wrong before? Think of Nazi Germany or America in the 1800's regarding slavery. Furthermore, who's to say that in the future a new moral majority might condemn atheism as an ethical danger to society? Would they be right? How would you know? The point is that deriving morality from society doesn't mean it is correct. History has shown that to be the case. Many atheists respond to this criticism by saying that society is evolving and getting better morally. Okay, but that is just begging the question. In other words, they are saying society is getting better morally because we are evolving. Really? In other words, societies are getting better morally because societies say so? Deriving morality from opinions and society\nFinally, if the atheist uses his own opinions in combination with those of society, then he is subjectively deciding what he thinks is right and wrong in the society around him. He is judging society's morals and deciding which ones are right and wrong, which ultimately brings us back to the first problem where he's deriving morality from his own opinions. He's logically befuddled. So, the atheist doesn't seem to have a leg to stand on when it comes to making moral assertions and actually defending them as being the right ones.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ab476c7e-c762-42ba-bf34-0333e6b6d529>"]},{"passage":"Moral and Ethical Issues\nJust war principles.

Like a diamond buried in mud, the Atman shines within us, yet its presence remains obscured, its shining purity masked by countless layers of ignorance: wrong identification, incorrect knowledge, misguided perceptions. It is important to emphasize that we are not trying to become something other than what we already are. We are not trying to become pure; we are pure. We are not trying to become perfect; we are perfect already. That is our real nature. Acting in accordance with our real nature—acting nobly, truthfully, kindly—tears away the veil of ignorance that hides the truth of reality. Whatever distorts this reality is a perversion of the truth. The whole of Vedanta ethics, then, is based upon a simple line of reasoning: Does this action or thought bring me closer to realizing the truth, or does it take me further away? Morality and the Ego\nWhat is it that prevents us from realizing the truth? Simply put, the ego: the sense of “I” and “mine.” As the great spiritual teacher Ramakrishna said, “The feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ has covered the Reality so we don’t see the truth.” He further said, “When the ego dies, all troubles cease.”\nWhat does the ego have to do with ethics and morality? Absolutely everything. All moral codes are based upon the ideal of unselfishness: placing others before ourselves, forcing the ego to play second fiddle. Following selfish desires is always a detriment to our spiritual life. Whether the action or thought is great or small, any selfishness will make the veil of ignorance thicker and darker. Conversely, any act of unselfishness, however great or small, will have the opposite effect. It is for this reason that doing good to others is a universal ethical and moral code, found in all religions and societies. Why is this so universal? Because it reflects the truth that we instinctively intuit: the oneness of life. Love, sympathy, and empathy are the affirmation of this truth; they are a reflexive response because they mirror the reality of the universe. When we feel love and sympathy we are verifying—albeit unconsciously—the oneness that already exists. When we feel hatred, anger, and jealousy we separate ourselves from others and deny our real nature which is infinite and free from limitations. What is the root of the problem here? Our wrong identification: thinking of ourselves as minds and bodies rather than infinite Spirit. As Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna’s great disciple, said: “As soon as I think that I am a little body, I want to preserve it, to protect it, to keep it nice, at the expense of other bodies; then you and I become separate. As soon as this idea of separation comes, it opens the door to all mischief and leads to all misery.”\nThe Point of Moral Virtues\nAll the moral virtues taught by Vedanta serve to remind us of our real nature, and no spiritual progress can be made without following them. Any attempt to do so would be like trying to build a house without a foundation. Before we even begin to think about how to realize the ultimate truth, we first need to build the groundwork of a real life, one based on real values. Spiritual life is not a haphazard affair: it is the most serious task that we shall ever face. And it is absolutely impossible to do so without living an ethical, moral life. It simply does not work. If Vedanta lays such stress on an ethical life, what, then, are the virtues we emphasize? Patanjali, one of the ancient sages of India and the father of its psychology, formulated standards of moral conduct which have been followed for thousands of years. These precepts function as spiritual tools, tools that can be used to create spiritually beneficial habits. These tools aren’t goals that can be instantly achieved—they are ideals to strive for, patterns to emulate. Still, it’s good to remember that when we do use these tools, we grow in strength and move closer to our ideal.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2eca8ee0-2073-4d1a-bb1c-b8ffff14e4fc>"]}]}
