My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nCommon Characteristics Of Antique Art\nSigned Limited Edition print\nPublished April 2005\nImage Size:- 6\" x 6\"\nby David Tatham\nArt is highly a subject of opinion and the question of identifying antique art is ambiguous in essence. Some people believe that only those artifacts from the Roman and Greek empires are antique. Others consider artifacts\nthat are more than 100 years to be antique. Whichever way one chooses to look at this, there are basic features that will\nalways be prevalent in an antique artifact. The back stamp must be there. It is basically the symbol of the manufacturer stamped or written on the back side of an item\ndetailing important information about it. This will establish the origin of the artifact, the age and for the classical\napproach will determine whether it is from Greek or Roman Empires. The stamp is paramount in ascertaining the authenticity\nand assessing its market value. The maker of the item will also be known. Art lovers are opinionated and could have some bias\ntowards particular artists or manufacturers. Most antique artifacts are handmade and have flaws. Such imperfections are not easy to notice and an individual must carefully\ncheck in order to notice them. Flaws prove that an item was handmade and is likely to be unique and rare. Signs of wear and tear are also common. Most highly valued antiques are of age and are characterized by abrasion, oxidation,\nand shrinkage. In furniture, the presence of crystallized glue and tool marks could also aid in determining the age. The materials used to make the item also matter. For instance in furniture, the presence of the square-headed handmade nails\nrather than the popular round-headed nails could indicate the time of manufacture. The genre must be conspicuous. An individual should be able to determine the age of an artifact easily from its features. The features that determine genre include the materials used, the period, and the artistic style used. Genres that are used\nto classify paintings include Arts and Crafts, Modernist, Art Deco and Art Noumea whereas furniture genres based on historic\nperiods include; Queen Anne, Victorian, Federal American, and Georgian. It is important for one to research the various historic\nperiods before identifying an artifact. The style will be an age indicator. Authenticity is a key feature of any antique item. It is crucial that a painting and prints\nfor example, is original and not a counterfeit of the real thing. Authenticity is established from the manufacturer's stamp on the back side or underside of the item. Determining the authenticity\nrequires an educated approach. It often requires the skills of a professional on this area to ascertain it. It involves a systematic\ninvestigation and analysis to determine whether an item is genuine. Objects must be referenced in national museum records. National museums have records of highly valued antique items. An individual\nmust therefore refer to records in museums closest to the place of origin of the item before deciding on the integrity of an artifact. The features outlined above encapsulate the general features of antique art. They form an essential basis for identifying artifacts. While some collectors may want to personally establish the integrity of an item they have collected, it often requires the eyes\nof an expert. Biography of wildlife artist, David Shepherd, CBE, FRSA, FRGS, OBE. Known as possibly the world's finest wildlife artist. David Shepherd\nhaving worked for many years as an artist\nacross the world,\nHis role as a conservationist is passionately believed, and\nhe has always felt that he had a obligation to help conserve the world and the animals that we live amongst. During his lifetime, David Shepherd has painted and drawn hundreds, if not thousands of images, and loves to talk to people of the many experiences\nhe has had whilst travelling and painting\nthroughout the world, often talking at charity dinners and other prestigeous social events. His personality is beautifully suited to this cause, as his easy going and straight forward attitude comes across well to express the love\nof art and his feelings for the ever decreasing wildlife in the world. As a young man, luck often deals its hand, and this was no exception, he wasn't particularly keen about other college activities.

While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year. Those are my favorites because they hold such wonderful memories.”\n\nThe Characteristics of Fine China\nThe artistic qualities of fine china may be the first thing you notice, whether you are examining dinnerware, vases or decorative pieces. The art of making porcelain china began in the country that lent its name to these items well over 1,000 years ago. Fine china -- bone or porcelain -- weighs substantially less than an equivalent stoneware or earthenware piece. While newer china pieces are typically dishwasher safe, for older items, don't put them into the dishwasher if you want them to last. China -- a catchall word used to describe most any ceramic piece, dinnerware or decorative item -- can be categorized into four basic types: bone china, porcelain china, stoneware and earthenware. The first two represent fine china, while the latter two are typically associated with everyday dinnerware, crocks, jugs or decorative pieces. The materials used, the firing processes, the decorative glazes and finishing touches mark the difference between fine china and functional china. Place your hand behind a plate of fine bone china -- the highest quality china made -- and you can see its shadow through it. Light passes through bone china, even more translucent than china made from porcelain clays and materials. Bone china, the English answer to Chinese porcelain, has a glasslike quality to it, is very light and thin, and is kiln-fired at even higher temperatures than porcelain china. Bone china seems to glow with an inner light; though seemingly fragile, it is very strong. With an absorbent rate slightly higher than bone china, porcelain china feels somewhat heavier than bone china. While bone china is traditionally white and may or may not have hand-painted designs, porcelain china dinnerware is available in a wide range of colors, rim treatments -- such as gold or silver -- and designer patterns. Not as translucent as bone china, porcelain china is a vitreous product, somewhat glasslike, that nevertheless retains some of the qualities of bone china. Some porcelain china patterns can run into the thousands of dollars for a complete table setting. Hallmarks and Porcelain Marks\nOn the back of fine china or its bottom, you can usually find specific hallmarks, maker's or artist's marks and pattern numbers. Pattern numbers identify the specific design and patterns created on the fine china, useful when you need to replace table settings lost due to breakage. Some brands of china hold greater value than others, based on when the china was made, the country and name of the manufacturer. Porcelain marks can identify the manufacturer, the country of origin and the age of the china. You can research these marks in books, through antique appraisers or online. As a native Californian, artist, journalist and published author, Laurie Brenner began writing professionally in 1975. She has written for newspapers, magazines, online publications and sites. Brenner graduated from San Diego's Coleman College.\n\nIn our Classic Collection you will find the very roots of Polish pottery, reaching back to the early 1700’s. The designs featured in this collection are simple, minimalistic — and it is exactly that simplicity, that renders them so charming. The pattern designers use mostly stamps to create the classic ornaments. The simplicity which characterizes this collection is expressed not only in the patterns themselves, but also in the color scheme, usually limited to just three hues. The Classic Collection is what laid the foundation for the more intricate patterns being designed today.\n\nMany of the finest potters signed their works - in Japanese characters, naturally - and would be serious collectors should check reference books to familiarize themselves with the signatures of famous names such as Ryuzan, Kinkozan and Yabu Meizan. Look for signatures on the base, usually painted in gold but sometimes impressed, and for decorators marks on the panels. These can greatly increase the value of a piece. Other marks to watch out for are the Satsuma\nmon - a cross within a circle that was the badge of the province's ruling family - and the word 'Satsuma' itself, which may appear in Japanese or English. Because there is so much Satsuma ware available in the West, collectors usually avoid chipped, cracked or otherwise damaged pieces. The only exception is when an otherwise very fine piece of work is slightly damaged, and even here the price can be reduced dramatically.\n\n### Question: What makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item and how is it different from regular pieces?","passages":[{"passage":"Identifying unmarked pottery can be a chore.

I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year. Those are my favorites because they hold such wonderful memories.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:40d41ec3-03b7-4d41-a676-e75586f937a8>"]},{"passage":"The Characteristics of Fine China\nThe artistic qualities of fine china may be the first thing you notice, whether you are examining dinnerware, vases or decorative pieces. The art of making porcelain china began in the country that lent its name to these items well over 1,000 years ago. Fine china -- bone or porcelain -- weighs substantially less than an equivalent stoneware or earthenware piece. While newer china pieces are typically dishwasher safe, for older items, don't put them into the dishwasher if you want them to last. China -- a catchall word used to describe most any ceramic piece, dinnerware or decorative item -- can be categorized into four basic types: bone china, porcelain china, stoneware and earthenware. The first two represent fine china, while the latter two are typically associated with everyday dinnerware, crocks, jugs or decorative pieces. The materials used, the firing processes, the decorative glazes and finishing touches mark the difference between fine china and functional china. Place your hand behind a plate of fine bone china -- the highest quality china made -- and you can see its shadow through it. Light passes through bone china, even more translucent than china made from porcelain clays and materials. Bone china, the English answer to Chinese porcelain, has a glasslike quality to it, is very light and thin, and is kiln-fired at even higher temperatures than porcelain china. Bone china seems to glow with an inner light; though seemingly fragile, it is very strong. With an absorbent rate slightly higher than bone china, porcelain china feels somewhat heavier than bone china. While bone china is traditionally white and may or may not have hand-painted designs, porcelain china dinnerware is available in a wide range of colors, rim treatments -- such as gold or silver -- and designer patterns. Not as translucent as bone china, porcelain china is a vitreous product, somewhat glasslike, that nevertheless retains some of the qualities of bone china. Some porcelain china patterns can run into the thousands of dollars for a complete table setting. Hallmarks and Porcelain Marks\nOn the back of fine china or its bottom, you can usually find specific hallmarks, maker's or artist's marks and pattern numbers. Pattern numbers identify the specific design and patterns created on the fine china, useful when you need to replace table settings lost due to breakage. Some brands of china hold greater value than others, based on when the china was made, the country and name of the manufacturer. Porcelain marks can identify the manufacturer, the country of origin and the age of the china. You can research these marks in books, through antique appraisers or online.

The designs featured in this collection are simple, minimalistic — and it is exactly that simplicity, that renders them so charming. The pattern designers use mostly stamps to create the classic ornaments. The simplicity which characterizes this collection is expressed not only in the patterns themselves, but also in the color scheme, usually limited to just three hues.

Other marks to watch out for are the Satsuma\nmon - a cross within a circle that was the badge of the province's ruling family - and the word 'Satsuma' itself, which may appear in Japanese or English. Because there is so much Satsuma ware available in the West, collectors usually avoid chipped, cracked or otherwise damaged pieces.

This protects the footage you have collected without worrying about access to WiFi or other services. Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges. Make best use of your incredible footage\nBy Bradley from Dream Big, Travel Far\nWith so much effort spent capturing your drone footage, my top tip would be to ensure you have a plan in place to make best use of it.

Feel free to add any other tips for traveling with a drone in the comments below.\n\nIf flying drones is your hobby, then you need to know the drone regulations so that you do not get into trouble. In fact, anyone who has a drone and uses it should be aware of the regulations that have been set by the authorities. This article will help you to understand the most important rules for flying drones and what you should and should not do while flying them. Drone Regulations, An Overview\nYou may not be a professional in flying drones—you got it just for the sake of fun and find it very interesting. However, there are certain rules and drone regulations for drones that need to be followed even if you are flying for fun. Here are some basic rules and drone regulations that everyone has to follow whenever you are flying a drone:\n- Flying drones near stadiums or people or in front of their houses is a strict no-no. If you do so then you would be violating people’s privacy and that is illegal. - Drones are also known as unmanned aircraft systems. That does not give you permission to fly near manned aircraft systems or operations. If you are caught in the process, you will have to face serious consequences. - The drone that you will be flying should not weigh more than 55 pounds. - Always fly your drone below 400 feet from the ground. Additionally, you should always check for surrounding obstacles and stay away from them as much as possible. - Flying a drone within five miles from the airport is a serious offense. If you are flying for a specific reason, then you should get a clearance from the control tower and the airport authorities. - Try to keep your drone within your visual line of sight all the time. Also, remember not to be reckless while flying it. There will be hefty fines and penalties if people get hurt or any aircraft is in danger because of your drone. Drones can be really fun to fly and you may look upon it as a toy, but the rules that have been imposed should be followed all times, lest you want to be in danger of breaking the laws. Ever since the 9\/11 attack, the CIA started using drones to ensure people are protected. Many modifications were made with the drones regarding the specifications and features. Much later, drones were introduced for everyday people to use. Now, you can buy a drone online and use it for your own purpose. But, you must follow the rules above. Initially, when the drones for everyday people were introduced, the rules were not so strict. You could fly it in your backyard or with your friends. However, there were several objections over the breaching of privacy and rules were modified later. Nowadays, many people use drones for professional purposes— such as checking plumbing issues or electrical problems that are impossible to reach by climbing up a ladder. There are also people who fly drones just for fun. However, you need to remember that they may seem to be toys to you, but if you are flying in a restricted area, you will draw unwanted suspicions on yourself. The drone regulations that have been imposed are completely safe for any user. But, if you try flying the drone on someone’s private property, then sooner or later you will be in trouble. In fact, there are people who can shoot your drone down if they feel that you are violating their privacy and you will not be able to do anything. So, what will you do is you face such a problem? The wisest thing to do would be to get the police involved. If you know what you are doing and you are not to blame, you should call the police and let them know what happened. You can show the video feeds from the drone or the photos that you have captured. These will be ideal to get you off the hook and prove that the person complaining is wrong. If you have been flying the drone above 100 feet, you can show the wide angle video and let the police decide if you were spying on someone or if someone’s privacy was being disrupted because of the drone. Sometimes, you do not know the extent to which you are flying the drone and you may end up flying over a private property. In such cases, the property owner can get in touch with you or the police and ask for the memory card to be confiscated. So, try to fly in areas where you are sure about the distance and the height. There is nothing better than getting a bird’s view of something. For this, drones will be your best friend. You will not get any other equipment or gadget that will provide the same functions and features with the same precision.\n\nThe Location Manager’s Guide to Drones\nThe following was featured in our e-newsletter, the M2 Aerials Report. To be included in future newsletters, subscribe at the bottom of this page. With drones now commonplace in the industry, Location Managers have the difficult task of knowing where drones can be flown and how to get in front of the issues that can arise when using drones for filming. With turnaround times as short as two weeks, it’s important to look for red flags upfront that may cause problems when it comes time to shoot. The first thing to know is that no matter their job function at the time, drones are an aviation tool and are regulated accordingly by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The FAA has several standard regulations to be aware of. Here’s an overview:\nIt is important to note that these laws are important for the safety and structure of national airspace, but waivers for these rules can be requested by licensed drone operators on a case by case basis. When you see a red flag, contact your drone operator as soon as possible for guidance. Red Flags for Drone Filming:\nAirport within a 5-mile radius\nFilming at a prison\nMilitary base in the area\nSchool in the area\nIn many circumstances, proper permissions can be achieved, but the last thing you want to do is to choose a location only to find out that you won’t be able to fly the drone afterward. “The last thing you want to happen is the Director chooses the one prison you scouted, for instance, that doesn’t allow drones. Then you’re stuck,” says Beth Melnick, Location Scout Manager for Northlight Locations. She advises scouts to pick up the phone at the first sign of an issue:\n“As soon as you see a red flag, call your drone operator.”\nIn addition to federal regulations (more details here), states, cities, and local municipalities often have their own regulations that go above and beyond the FAA’s requirements. When scouting a location, keep the following in mind:\nTiming of the Shoot\nWith limited time to prep for a shoot, ask yourself important questions early. - Looking to catch the magic hour? You will need a Nighttime Waiver. - Want to shoot downtown? Plan carefully; flying over people requires a special waiver. - Is your perfect location outside next to an airport or government building? You’ll need a waiver to fly in a restricted airspace. - Tip: Use https:\/\/app.airmap.io\/ to check airspace for your location\nSome waivers can take up to 4 months to process! If your drone shot is at the beginning of filming and you’re going to need a waiver, it may not come in time. Applying for waivers can be a taxing process and are never guaranteed. We suggest consulting with an experienced drone cinematographer as early as possible whenever aerial shots are desired. Some FAA-certified aerial filming companies, like M2 Aerials, have already obtained waivers that stay with them, such as a nighttime flying waiver. This means they don’t need to apply for a waiver for your job; the waiver is good for any otherwise-approved job in the U.S. Drone operators can also request near real-time processing of airspace authorization for locations that are part of the FAA’s LAANC system (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability). Confirm these permissions with your drone pilot. The Location of the Set\nYou can quickly assess the ease or difficulty with which you will be able to use a drone for filming by the type of scene location. Urban settings require the most consideration and preparation. The most inhibiting federal regulation for using a drone in urban environment is the restriction on flying over people who are not part of the operation. Due to the highly populated nature of cities, this makes filming especially difficult. For veterans of the industry, it is good practice to think of flying a drone in the same way you think of flying a helicopter. Make the same provisions such as clearing the streets. If a helicopter could shoot the scene legally, so can the drone. The other inhibitor to urban filming via drone is privacy laws. If you’re going to be flying over skyscrapers or commercial buildings, you must first obtain permission from the building owner. Most major cities have their own regulations and codes for UAV operations, some stricter than others.\n\nAnnually more individuals, business as well as establishments are benefiting from the improvements of drone technology. As the number of drones is boosting, so are the variety of laws, laws and referrals to promote the great use drones. Services are utilizing drones to increase their services, organizations want to boost the lifestyle of their citizens (presumably), and individuals, normally, just want to have fun. Whatever is the factor, below are some suggestions so you can use your drone in the safest feasible means. First I have a very unpopular referral: Read the manual. I know just how tough it can be, once you have your drone you need to unwind and also not fly it as soon as possible. This is a brand-new innovation as well as even if you are acquainted with drones you can not risk your financial investment even if you are too careless to review the directions. It will certainly take you just a few mins to read at the very least what you take into consideration one of the most integral parts so you can be certain that you totally understand just how to run it. Laws and also laws\nOne more essential element is to obey the laws and laws of the zone in which you intend to fly your drone. They differ relying on where you are, yet generally terms they are quite alike. Most of the policies talk about how high your drone can go. The FAA states that a drone can not go higher than 120m (400 feet). A various restriction to flying your drone is not just how high yet where you can take it. There are certain areas where it is prohibited to fly a drone. An example is within 5 miles of an airport. You can not fly a drone over people or lorries due to the fact that this can be thought about as a threat for both and you will certainly be in charge of any type of damage triggered for your drone. The wise way is to get informed regarding the guidelines as well as the zones where the drone is to be used. Do not lose sight\nOne more essential safety and security recommendations (as well as a legislation actually) is that you fly your drone just regarding you can see it and also no even more than that. I do not think that I ought to also explain this, but just to make sure below it goes: Forgeting your drone can be truly unsafe for individuals on the ground as well as expensive ought to you lose your drone entirely. If you can not see your drone there’s an opportunity you can shed communication with the controller and shed full control. Although numerous drones have ‘return to safety and security’ capability which enables them to return to their starting point, it is still suggested not to endeavor until now to make sure that you forget your drone. When to fly? Inspecting the weather can assist determine when’s an excellent or a bad time to fly them. Although some drones show no worry to fly on cloudy days, others do show some deficiencies under these problems. Again, reviewing the manual is a good suggestion. In the case when you not just have cloudy days yet additionally strong winds, no matter just how great your drone is, it is a bad concept to fly them. The winds can make it more difficult to steer the drone as well as it can go anywhere. Once more, it does not matter how excellent your drone is, if it can happen to actual size helicopters, it will occur to your drone as well. On days with solid winds, maintain your drone in your home. Go to this website to learn more about aerial photography, http:\/\/impressair.com.au\/\nSo since you have reviewed the handbook as well as obtained all the info you need to fly your drone, you are ready to have some enjoyable with it, right? Well, not fairly. Although you know the theory, you still need to examine that the drone is functioning appropriately. You need to examine that every part is in excellent problem. This consists of propellers, batteries, lights and everything affixed to the drone. And also this has to be done every time you are flying the drone. Every single time that the drone is mosting likely to be utilized it needs to be inspected. A lot of business supply an application for cellular phones that assist pilots manage their drones. If you have it, after that it is most likely that the app has an alternative to help you adjust your drone. This is a wonderful tool to ensure that the parts are working properly as well as you can go flying your drone with no concerns.\n\nHowever, if you have a special commercial project in mind you can apply for an exemption to the Icelandic Transport Authority. A Few Things to Remember\nMany of Iceland’s protected areas have not been uploaded to drone software, so just because the drone is able to take off does not mean that you should\nAlways observe no-drone signs\nMake sure you have a clear plan and ensure that where you wish to fly is legal, safe and with the necessary permits if necessary. If you are flying just for fun, for example for Instagram, please ensure that you follow all rules concerning flying drones for non-commercial purposes. If possible, always alert a local ranger that you are operating in the area. This is mostly out of courtesy. Please also ensure that you are not disturbing the experience for any other visitors. Be a responsible drone pilot. Respect the rules, the people around you, and the nature you want to capture. And above all else…..have fun!! Pssst!! Are you looking for more tips around just general safety and responsibility whilst in Iceland? You do?? We love you already. Head on over here, then.\n\nWhen you get a drone for the first time, it is likely that you will want to get out and start flying it straight away. It’s important to first read up on local laws and regulations, so you don’t end up with a heavy fine for flying your drone in a place where it is illegal to do so. Here, we summarize some of the main places where drone flight is forbidden, so you can enjoy your drone safely and legally. If you are flying a drone for recreational use, thankfully there are not too many rules, so you can enjoy your drone! There are a few places where you should definitely not fly however, such as near airports or other aircraft. If you plan to use a drone within 5 miles of an airport, you must notify the control tower. It’s also forbidden to fly over stadiums, sporting events or groups of people. Fires and other emergency situations should not be flown over with a drone either, for obvious reasons. Other places where drones should not be flown include: over government buildings, military areas, prisons, water treatment facilities and power stations. National parks also prohibit the use of drones, so you won’t be able to get that beautiful aerial shot of the Grand Canyon unfortunately. Disneyland and Disney world are also no-fly zones. Sometimes, temporary flying restrictions come into place, so if there is an event taking place, double check for the most up-to-date information. Events such as a presidential visit will likely cause a TFR to come into place for example. In most cases, it’s best to use common sense and take reasonable precautions to be safe. Drones should not be operated by those under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Drones must be kept at least 25 feet from individuals and property, and they should always remain within your sight. This is when having a drone with return to home features is handy – simply press a button and the drone will come back to you if you lose sight or control of it. A recreational drone should not be flown over 400 feet, although it can be difficult to tell if your drone is below this height or not. You should not fly your drone in adverse weather conditions, particularly high winds which could easily throw your drone off course. Poor visibility, such as mist and fog, are also not suitable for drone flight, as you will not be able to keep an eye on your aircraft. You should also take precautions when using the camera on your drone in certain areas. Do not take photographs in areas where it is assumed and expected that privacy will be had. In any case, it’s best to check local laws before flying with a drone, particularly if you are near to private property, large groups of people or busy roads. The fines for flying in a reckless or careless way can run into tens of thousands of dollars, so it’s best to take the time to understand the regulations before setting out with your new drone.

Maybe it’s the years of my parents telling me not to play in the house, but there is something exciting about working with a client where indoor flight is part of the job. Let’s face it, drone accidents can happen to good pilots. Pilots practice good flying techniques, service their equipment regularly and work to mitigate risks wherever possible. Even still, an equipment failure, an attack from a bird or simple human error can cause a crash.\n\nI can imagine a high-art\/commercial-art rumble brewing over this (what is art, really?) The motivation for the FAA policy was to continue to allow toy-like aircraft to fly under the radar (sorry), while strictly regulating private use of larger, faster, and more technologically advanced unmanned aircraft. The current regulation, strangely, splits two identical drones flying in an identical way into either an “Aircraft,” or just “a model plane,” based purely on whether the flight is used for a commercial purpose. Given the poorly defined term, “commercial,” flying a drone that includes a camera may be illegal simply because the owner–privately, in his or her own mind–is contemplating selling the pictures. The result of this seemingly arbitrary FAA policies and conflicting case law is the stifling of legitimate and safe drone use for “business purposes,” such as filmmaking, journalism, and commercial photography. Congress is attempting to remedy the situation with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which requires the FAA to actually come up with some workable rules to regulate the use of drones. These rules are supposed to be in place by September 2015, but government bureaucracies aren’t known for their nimbleness. In the 2007 policy statement on drones, the FAA announced that it had “undertaken a safety review that will examine the feasibility of creating a different category of unmanned ‘vehicles’… focused on operations which do not qualify as sport and recreation, but also may not require a certificate of airworthiness.”\nThis certainly sounds like the FAA would consider an artistic exception to their drone rules but that policy statement was made seven years ago. So how this will play out still remains a question, given that the first handful of commercial drone flights were only approved in the last few months. Will the rules change as the technology becomes more accepted and safety concerns are addressed? Of course. How fast will the FAA drone rules change? No one knows. 157 Comments|Getty Images is one of the largest purveyor of stock photos in the world and aggressively protects their copyrights.

This protects the footage you have collected without worrying about access to WiFi or other services. Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges.

In fact, anyone who has a drone and uses it should be aware of the regulations that have been set by the authorities. This article will help you to understand the most important rules for flying drones and what you should and should not do while flying them. Drone Regulations, An Overview\nYou may not be a professional in flying drones—you got it just for the sake of fun and find it very interesting. However, there are certain rules and drone regulations for drones that need to be followed even if you are flying for fun. Here are some basic rules and drone regulations that everyone has to follow whenever you are flying a drone:\n- Flying drones near stadiums or people or in front of their houses is a strict no-no. If you do so then you would be violating people’s privacy and that is illegal. - Drones are also known as unmanned aircraft systems. That does not give you permission to fly near manned aircraft systems or operations. If you are caught in the process, you will have to face serious consequences. - The drone that you will be flying should not weigh more than 55 pounds. - Always fly your drone below 400 feet from the ground. Additionally, you should always check for surrounding obstacles and stay away from them as much as possible. - Flying a drone within five miles from the airport is a serious offense. If you are flying for a specific reason, then you should get a clearance from the control tower and the airport authorities. - Try to keep your drone within your visual line of sight all the time. Also, remember not to be reckless while flying it. There will be hefty fines and penalties if people get hurt or any aircraft is in danger because of your drone. Drones can be really fun to fly and you may look upon it as a toy, but the rules that have been imposed should be followed all times, lest you want to be in danger of breaking the laws. Ever since the 9\/11 attack, the CIA started using drones to ensure people are protected. Many modifications were made with the drones regarding the specifications and features. Much later, drones were introduced for everyday people to use. Now, you can buy a drone online and use it for your own purpose. But, you must follow the rules above. Initially, when the drones for everyday people were introduced, the rules were not so strict. You could fly it in your backyard or with your friends. However, there were several objections over the breaching of privacy and rules were modified later. Nowadays, many people use drones for professional purposes— such as checking plumbing issues or electrical problems that are impossible to reach by climbing up a ladder. There are also people who fly drones just for fun. However, you need to remember that they may seem to be toys to you, but if you are flying in a restricted area, you will draw unwanted suspicions on yourself. The drone regulations that have been imposed are completely safe for any user. But, if you try flying the drone on someone’s private property, then sooner or later you will be in trouble. In fact, there are people who can shoot your drone down if they feel that you are violating their privacy and you will not be able to do anything. So, what will you do is you face such a problem? The wisest thing to do would be to get the police involved. If you know what you are doing and you are not to blame, you should call the police and let them know what happened. You can show the video feeds from the drone or the photos that you have captured. These will be ideal to get you off the hook and prove that the person complaining is wrong. If you have been flying the drone above 100 feet, you can show the wide angle video and let the police decide if you were spying on someone or if someone’s privacy was being disrupted because of the drone. Sometimes, you do not know the extent to which you are flying the drone and you may end up flying over a private property. In such cases, the property owner can get in touch with you or the police and ask for the memory card to be confiscated. So, try to fly in areas where you are sure about the distance and the height. There is nothing better than getting a bird’s view of something. For this, drones will be your best friend. You will not get any other equipment or gadget that will provide the same functions and features with the same precision.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a207edcc-5f66-489a-89b3-5fa67b4d268c>"]},{"passage":"The Location Manager’s Guide to Drones\nThe following was featured in our e-newsletter, the M2 Aerials Report. To be included in future newsletters, subscribe at the bottom of this page. With drones now commonplace in the industry, Location Managers have the difficult task of knowing where drones can be flown and how to get in front of the issues that can arise when using drones for filming. With turnaround times as short as two weeks, it’s important to look for red flags upfront that may cause problems when it comes time to shoot. The first thing to know is that no matter their job function at the time, drones are an aviation tool and are regulated accordingly by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The FAA has several standard regulations to be aware of. Here’s an overview:\nIt is important to note that these laws are important for the safety and structure of national airspace, but waivers for these rules can be requested by licensed drone operators on a case by case basis. When you see a red flag, contact your drone operator as soon as possible for guidance. Red Flags for Drone Filming:\nAirport within a 5-mile radius\nFilming at a prison\nMilitary base in the area\nSchool in the area\nIn many circumstances, proper permissions can be achieved, but the last thing you want to do is to choose a location only to find out that you won’t be able to fly the drone afterward. “The last thing you want to happen is the Director chooses the one prison you scouted, for instance, that doesn’t allow drones. Then you’re stuck,” says Beth Melnick, Location Scout Manager for Northlight Locations. She advises scouts to pick up the phone at the first sign of an issue:\n“As soon as you see a red flag, call your drone operator.”\nIn addition to federal regulations (more details here), states, cities, and local municipalities often have their own regulations that go above and beyond the FAA’s requirements. When scouting a location, keep the following in mind:\nTiming of the Shoot\nWith limited time to prep for a shoot, ask yourself important questions early. - Looking to catch the magic hour? You will need a Nighttime Waiver. - Want to shoot downtown? Plan carefully; flying over people requires a special waiver. - Is your perfect location outside next to an airport or government building? You’ll need a waiver to fly in a restricted airspace. - Tip: Use https:\/\/app.airmap.io\/ to check airspace for your location\nSome waivers can take up to 4 months to process! If your drone shot is at the beginning of filming and you’re going to need a waiver, it may not come in time. Applying for waivers can be a taxing process and are never guaranteed. We suggest consulting with an experienced drone cinematographer as early as possible whenever aerial shots are desired. Some FAA-certified aerial filming companies, like M2 Aerials, have already obtained waivers that stay with them, such as a nighttime flying waiver. This means they don’t need to apply for a waiver for your job; the waiver is good for any otherwise-approved job in the U.S. Drone operators can also request near real-time processing of airspace authorization for locations that are part of the FAA’s LAANC system (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability). Confirm these permissions with your drone pilot. The Location of the Set\nYou can quickly assess the ease or difficulty with which you will be able to use a drone for filming by the type of scene location. Urban settings require the most consideration and preparation. The most inhibiting federal regulation for using a drone in urban environment is the restriction on flying over people who are not part of the operation. Due to the highly populated nature of cities, this makes filming especially difficult. For veterans of the industry, it is good practice to think of flying a drone in the same way you think of flying a helicopter. Make the same provisions such as clearing the streets. If a helicopter could shoot the scene legally, so can the drone. The other inhibitor to urban filming via drone is privacy laws. If you’re going to be flying over skyscrapers or commercial buildings, you must first obtain permission from the building owner. Most major cities have their own regulations and codes for UAV operations, some stricter than others.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39c8e512-7526-48c0-a055-5fd16257378c>"]},{"passage":"Annually more individuals, business as well as establishments are benefiting from the improvements of drone technology.

Services are utilizing drones to increase their services, organizations want to boost the lifestyle of their citizens (presumably), and individuals, normally, just want to have fun. Whatever is the factor, below are some suggestions so you can use your drone in the safest feasible means. First I have a very unpopular referral: Read the manual. I know just how tough it can be, once you have your drone you need to unwind and also not fly it as soon as possible. This is a brand-new innovation as well as even if you are acquainted with drones you can not risk your financial investment even if you are too careless to review the directions. It will certainly take you just a few mins to read at the very least what you take into consideration one of the most integral parts so you can be certain that you totally understand just how to run it. Laws and also laws\nOne more essential element is to obey the laws and laws of the zone in which you intend to fly your drone. They differ relying on where you are, yet generally terms they are quite alike. Most of the policies talk about how high your drone can go. The FAA states that a drone can not go higher than 120m (400 feet). A various restriction to flying your drone is not just how high yet where you can take it. There are certain areas where it is prohibited to fly a drone. An example is within 5 miles of an airport. You can not fly a drone over people or lorries due to the fact that this can be thought about as a threat for both and you will certainly be in charge of any type of damage triggered for your drone. The wise way is to get informed regarding the guidelines as well as the zones where the drone is to be used. Do not lose sight\nOne more essential safety and security recommendations (as well as a legislation actually) is that you fly your drone just regarding you can see it and also no even more than that. I do not think that I ought to also explain this, but just to make sure below it goes: Forgeting your drone can be truly unsafe for individuals on the ground as well as expensive ought to you lose your drone entirely. If you can not see your drone there’s an opportunity you can shed communication with the controller and shed full control. Although numerous drones have ‘return to safety and security’ capability which enables them to return to their starting point, it is still suggested not to endeavor until now to make sure that you forget your drone. When to fly? Inspecting the weather can assist determine when’s an excellent or a bad time to fly them. Although some drones show no worry to fly on cloudy days, others do show some deficiencies under these problems. Again, reviewing the manual is a good suggestion. In the case when you not just have cloudy days yet additionally strong winds, no matter just how great your drone is, it is a bad concept to fly them. The winds can make it more difficult to steer the drone as well as it can go anywhere. Once more, it does not matter how excellent your drone is, if it can happen to actual size helicopters, it will occur to your drone as well. On days with solid winds, maintain your drone in your home.

It’s important to first read up on local laws and regulations, so you don’t end up with a heavy fine for flying your drone in a place where it is illegal to do so. Here, we summarize some of the main places where drone flight is forbidden, so you can enjoy your drone safely and legally. If you are flying a drone for recreational use, thankfully there are not too many rules, so you can enjoy your drone! There are a few places where you should definitely not fly however, such as near airports or other aircraft. If you plan to use a drone within 5 miles of an airport, you must notify the control tower. It’s also forbidden to fly over stadiums, sporting events or groups of people. Fires and other emergency situations should not be flown over with a drone either, for obvious reasons. Other places where drones should not be flown include: over government buildings, military areas, prisons, water treatment facilities and power stations. National parks also prohibit the use of drones, so you won’t be able to get that beautiful aerial shot of the Grand Canyon unfortunately. Disneyland and Disney world are also no-fly zones. Sometimes, temporary flying restrictions come into place, so if there is an event taking place, double check for the most up-to-date information. Events such as a presidential visit will likely cause a TFR to come into place for example. In most cases, it’s best to use common sense and take reasonable precautions to be safe. Drones should not be operated by those under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Drones must be kept at least 25 feet from individuals and property, and they should always remain within your sight. This is when having a drone with return to home features is handy – simply press a button and the drone will come back to you if you lose sight or control of it. A recreational drone should not be flown over 400 feet, although it can be difficult to tell if your drone is below this height or not. You should not fly your drone in adverse weather conditions, particularly high winds which could easily throw your drone off course. Poor visibility, such as mist and fog, are also not suitable for drone flight, as you will not be able to keep an eye on your aircraft. You should also take precautions when using the camera on your drone in certain areas. Do not take photographs in areas where it is assumed and expected that privacy will be had. In any case, it’s best to check local laws before flying with a drone, particularly if you are near to private property, large groups of people or busy roads. The fines for flying in a reckless or careless way can run into tens of thousands of dollars, so it’s best to take the time to understand the regulations before setting out with your new drone.

The motivation for the FAA policy was to continue to allow toy-like aircraft to fly under the radar (sorry), while strictly regulating private use of larger, faster, and more technologically advanced unmanned aircraft. The current regulation, strangely, splits two identical drones flying in an identical way into either an “Aircraft,” or just “a model plane,” based purely on whether the flight is used for a commercial purpose. Given the poorly defined term, “commercial,” flying a drone that includes a camera may be illegal simply because the owner–privately, in his or her own mind–is contemplating selling the pictures. The result of this seemingly arbitrary FAA policies and conflicting case law is the stifling of legitimate and safe drone use for “business purposes,” such as filmmaking, journalism, and commercial photography. Congress is attempting to remedy the situation with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which requires the FAA to actually come up with some workable rules to regulate the use of drones. These rules are supposed to be in place by September 2015, but government bureaucracies aren’t known for their nimbleness. In the 2007 policy statement on drones, the FAA announced that it had “undertaken a safety review that will examine the feasibility of creating a different category of unmanned ‘vehicles’… focused on operations which do not qualify as sport and recreation, but also may not require a certificate of airworthiness.”\nThis certainly sounds like the FAA would consider an artistic exception to their drone rules but that policy statement was made seven years ago. So how this will play out still remains a question, given that the first handful of commercial drone flights were only approved in the last few months. Will the rules change as the technology becomes more accepted and safety concerns are addressed? Of course. How fast will the FAA drone rules change?

For businesses dealing with uncertain demand and lead times, there are specific models available. The newsvendor problem approach is particularly useful when dealing with perishable items or services with time-sensitive demand.","answer":"Managing inventory for a service business can be different from a traditional product-based business, as the focus is more on resources and supplies rather than tangible goods. However, effective inventory management is still crucial to ensure that services can be delivered efficiently and cost-effectively. Here are some strategies to manage inventory for a service business:\n\n1. **Identify Necessary Supplies**: Begin by identifying all the supplies and resources needed to deliver your services. This could include office supplies, materials for projects, uniforms, or equipment.\n\n2. **Implement a Par Level System**: Determine the minimum stock level (par level) for each item. When stock falls below this level, it’s time to reorder. This helps ensure you have enough supplies to meet customer demand without overstocking.\n\n3. **Regular Inventory Audits**: Conduct regular physical counts of your inventory to ensure accuracy. This is especially important for service businesses where inventory levels can fluctuate based on service demand.\n\n4. **Use Inventory Management Software**: Invest in software that can track your inventory levels, manage reordering, and provide real-time data on stock. This can help automate the process and reduce errors.\n\n5. **Supplier Relationship Management**: Build strong relationships with suppliers. This can help you negotiate better pricing, secure priority service, and ensure timely delivery of supplies.\n\n6. **Optimize Storage Space**: Efficiently use your storage space to minimize costs and improve accessibility to inventory. Consider the layout of your storage area to facilitate easy picking and replenishment.\n\n7. **Implement First-In, First-Out (FIFO)**: For perishable or time-sensitive supplies, use FIFO to ensure older items are used before they expire or become obsolete.\n\n8. **Forecast Demand**: Use historical data and market trends to forecast future demand for your services. This can help you plan inventory purchases more effectively.\n\n9. **Reduce Waste**: Look for ways to reduce waste in your operations. This could include using supplies more efficiently or finding ways to repurpose waste materials.\n\n10. **Employee Training**: Ensure your staff are trained on inventory management procedures. This includes how to accurately track inventory, reorder supplies, and manage stock levels.\n\n11. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your inventory management processes and make adjustments as needed. This can include changing reorder points, adjusting par levels, or exploring new suppliers.\n\n12. **Emergency Stock**: Keep a small amount of emergency stock for unexpected demand surges or supply chain disruptions.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, a service business can maintain an efficient inventory system that supports its operations and enhances customer satisfaction.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Do not be scared to request a lower minimum order quantity to avoid carrying as much inventory. A healthy connection is about more than being pleasant. It all comes down to practical, proactive communication. Notify your supplier when you anticipate a spike in sales or a high volume of purchase orders so they can adapt production accordingly. Request that they warn you when a product is running late so that you can suspend promotions or find a temporary replacement. 5. Physical inventory\nA physical inventory, also known as a stock take, is the process of counting all of your goods simultaneously. After the fiscal year, many businesses do this to coincide with accounting and income tax reporting. Although physical inventories usually are performed once a year, they may be pretty disruptive to corporate operations, and they are tedious. If you do discover a disparity, it can be challenging to narrow down the source of the error when looking back over a whole year. How To Develop an Inventory Action Plan\nBecause inventory storage is costly, businesses are frequently irritated when products collect dust on shelves rather than customers’ purchasing and generating income. While dusting the shelves adds extra effort, it’s not nearly as awful as dealing with a disgruntled customer because you’ve run out of his favorite product. Inventory stock plans are intended to avert one of these outcomes. Step 1: Ascertain Demand\nAn intelligent inventory plan’s first rule is to stock things that customers desire and that statistics indicate are likely to be purchased. This can be determined using historical sales data, which can be obtained by tracking sales over time and logging the results in a database. Sell an average of 30 cartons of milk per day, with steady demand throughout the week. Your inventory control strategy should allow you to meet that demand while also avoiding excessive inventory. Under certain conditions, you may also wish to keep select items in stock, even if an order is weaker or less predictable. For instance, if a critical spare part for an appliance you sell is challenging to obtain promptly, stocking a limited supply can be a prudent business option. Suppose ordering that position at the last minute is prohibitively expensive, and its absence causes customers to switch providers. In that case, the storage costs may be negligible about the costs of not having it when needed. Step 2: Create a Plan for Replenishment\nSupply chain management is essential to the success of any inventory management strategy. Determine your reorder points, the time required for inventory to arrive, and any potential impediments. For example, a just-in-time inventory system works best when you are confident that you can obtain required goods promptly if necessary. Establish a broad replacement schedule for things you will require frequently. This could include daily deliveries of perishables to monthly shipments of non-perishables. Additionally, consider when you need stock replenishment on an Irregular Schedule and the associated costs. Step 3: Maintain Inventory Control\nThe tracking methods of an inventory system are only as good as the system itself. Ideally, use a point-of-sale software system to catalog your inventory and track changes in real-time, and train your personnel to use it at all times. This can be difficult in a Small Firm that prepares completed items using materials from a central inventory base, such as a restaurant, but it is still necessary. Each time a customer puts an order, keep track of which ingredients go into a meal or what goes into a complete cabinet and drain those items from your inventory. Step 4: Monitor and Adjust\nPeriodically re-examine your inventory control system to ensure that the basic assumptions remain valid. If you find that you are suddenly out of corn chips with each inventory cycle – yet have more salsa than you require – your initial demand projections may have been incorrect. Changing the order quantity for each item might help return your inventory levels to their optimal state. Developing a liquidation strategy for unsold inventory can help you move it out of storage and maximize the use of available space. For instance, end-of-season discount sales might help clear out inventory in a retail business that would otherwise linger in stock for an extended time. How do you keep track of your inventory? The easiest inventory tracking method is to manually count your stock every two weeks and compare it to sales. This is referred to as periodic inventory. Additionally, perpetual inventory utilizes an inventory management app or software incorporated with your business’s point of sale system.\n\nInventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren’t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can’t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that’s why storing them for long isn’t advisable. What’s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today’s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you’ll know if it’s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you’ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn’t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that’s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don’t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5.\n\nInventory management is an essential part of doing business, whether you’re a Fortune 500 company or a mom-and-pop shop. It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.\n\nA marketing communication plan is an essential tool for any firm. Generally speaking, if you want your firm to succeed, you must implement an integrated marketing communication plan. Communicating…continue reading\n5+ Sample Inventory Action Plan\nWhat Is an Inventory Planning? Inventory planning enables businesses to purchase the appropriate amount of goods and determine how frequently to replenish. Inventory planning assists in lowering the cost of stocking things and ensuring that there is sufficient stock for manufacturing and selling items. Inventory management is a significant component of supply chain management. According to research, the 80\/20 rule implies that 80% of outcomes originate from 20% of efforts, customers, or another unit of measurement. When applied to inventories, the rule means that businesses generate approximately 80% of their revenues from 20% of their products. Benefits of Inventory Planning\nInventory control and planning are two processes part of inventory management. Planning and controlling are critical to management success, as with every management process. The rationale for such a strong emphasis on inventory is that it typically represents a corporation’s most significant cash-flow component. This is true for both purchasing and selling merchandise. As a result, inventory management directly impacts the organization’s financial health. Inventory control and planning benefit small firms in the following ways:\nInventory Management Strategies\nInventory management is a highly adaptable aspect of the company. Each business has a unique inventory control strategy. However, every organization should seek to eliminate human error as much as possible from inventory management, which includes utilizing inventory management software. Regardless of the method you employ, the following will help you manage your inventory more effectively—and increase your cash flow. 1. Six Sigma\nSix Sigma is a methodology and toolkit for enhancing business processes. It is used in inventory and supply chain management to minimize excess and obsolete write-offs. This inventory is frequently sold below cost or donated, which results in a loss of revenue for small business owners. Having the appropriate stock to meet demand minimizes waste and variation issues. Six Sigma is an excellent way of resolving inventory issues. It is orderly and dependable. 2. Set par levels\nSet par levels for each of your goods to simplify inventory management. Par levels are the bare minimum amount of product that must always be on hand. When your inventory falls below certain specified levels, it’s time to place more orders. Ideally, you’ll order the smallest quantity necessary to return above par. Par levels vary by product and determine the speed of an item sells and the time required to restock. While establishing par levels needs some study and decision-making upfront, they will streamline the ordering process. Not only will this make decision-making more accessible for you, but it will also empower your team to make decisions on your behalf. Bear in mind that circumstances change over time. Verify par levels many times a year to ensure they remain reasonable. Meanwhile, don’t be scared to tweak your par levels upward or below. First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a critical inventory management philosophy. This means that your oldest stock is sold first (first in), not your newest store. This is critical for perishable products to avoid unsellable spoiling. Additionally, FIFO is an intelligent technique for non-perishable products. If the same boxes are constantly relegated to the back, they are more prone to wear out. Also, packaging design and functionalities frequently evolve. You don’t want to ramble up with something any longer marketable. To handle a FIFO system effectively, you’ll need a well-organized warehouse. This often entails adding fresh items from the back or otherwise ensuring that existing inventory remains initially. If you’re operating with a warehousing and fulfillment provider, they’re likely already doing this, but it’s prudent to confirm. 4. Relationship management\nSuccessful inventory management requires the ability to adapt fast. Whether you need to return a slow-selling item to make place for a new product, swiftly replenish a high-volume seller, solve manufacturing concerns, or temporarily extend your storage space, it’s critical to maintain a solid relationship with your suppliers. In this manner, they’ll be more receptive to collaborating with you to resolve issues. Maintaining a positive relationship with your product suppliers, in particular, is critical. Frequently, minimum order amounts are negotiable.\n\nEffective Forecasting\nForecasting is central to inventory management. You need to predict the availability of supplies and your customer’s demands. Your inventory management needs to integrate with your business. Understand the seasons and the impact they have on your business. Will the Christmas and New Year holidays affect your product’s demand? Focus on products that are fast-moving during specific events. Research if there are any upcoming marketing events or fairs in your region. You are likely to sell more items than usual. For this reason, you might need to have a higher stock of specific products based on the type of event. To learn how to manage inventories effectively, you need precise predictions. Take advantage of the influx of customers during high peak seasons. Your business will benefit from the approach. 6. Note the Minimum Stock Level\nYou need to know the minimum stock level for timely reorders. Allowing your stock levels to go low has adverse effects on production. Understand how to go about determining the minimum stock level for smooth inventory. One of the factors to consider is the nature of the material. If you get your materials from one supplier, fixing the stock level might be unnecessary. But if you have several suppliers, you need to maintain the minimum stock level to sustain production. You ought to analyze the lead time. For a shorter lead time, the reorder level should remain constant. The longer lead times affect the supply chain because of the changing variability and demand. 7. The Pareto Principle\nStreamlining your inventory management is not a straightforward process. The scattered and varied nature of inventory makes its organization complex. The 80\/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, can enhance the efficiency of inventory control. The 80\/20 rule is an invaluable framework in controlling the flow of your inventory. Simply put, the 80\/20 rule means that 20% of your inventory is responsible for 80% of your profits. Your top sellers are 20%, which keeps you in business even during tough seasons. When you understand the Pareto principle, you’ll know the products that need prioritizing. Give extra attention to your top products. Monitor the stock and have these products in an easily accessible area. You will know how to manage inventories effectively once you understand the significance of the 80\/20 rule. The insights will enable you to make informed decisions on suppliers. Your top-products supplier should be reliable enough. 8. Quality Control\nQuality control is a crucial part of any business. The quality control tools in place can lead to business growth and customer satisfaction. Have a checklist so that your team can assist in confirming the quality of supplies. You can check for any signs of damage such as broken seals, tears, or leaks. Raise the issue with your supplier as you identify the damage. Selling an item that has any signs of tear can damage your credibility as the seller. Confirm the product sizes, styles, and colors. Your order should match your description. Ensure that you also confirm the prices. Maintain high-quality standards to increase your sales and satisfy your customers. Confirm the lighting, temperature, and humidity of your warehouse. Poor storage can undermine the quality of goods, whether perishable or non-perishable. Amazon’s shipping costs for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.6 billion. The expenses involved in storing and shipping products can be high. That’s why dropshipping can be an ideal way of managing your inventory more affordably. Drop-shipping allows you to sell products without necessarily holding them in your warehouse. When a consumer buys an item from your store, the manufacturer or wholesaler can do the inventory and shipping. This approach can be cost-effective because you won’t have to incur expenses on storage and several inventory processes. Dropshipping is one of the inventory methods adopted by online retailers. One inevitable problem with drop shipping is minimal involvement. For that reason, customer satisfaction might be unachievable. If a manufacturer delivers a defective product, your credibility as the seller is at stake. 10. Note the Low Turn Stock\nDo you have a product that has been lying in your warehouse for more than six months? It’s time to reconsider whether it is worth stocking the item. The more such things stay on the shelf, the more their value reduces. The excess stock is a wastage of your precious store. Consider having a promotional sale to get rid of such items. You can sell them at a 50% discount to attract more customers.\n\nAre you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

As your business grows or changes, so do your processes for inventory management. Below we review the basics of inventory management, common challenges companies are facing today, cost reduction strategies, and why and when to consider new inventory management software. What is inventory management? Inventory management is the process of ordering, storing and delivering products in the form of finished goods or raw materials for manufacturers. It’s all about balance – having the right product in the right quantity at the right time in the right place at the right cost. Role within the supply chain\nInventory management is a crucial part of your supply chain. It addresses how you order, maintain and deliver your inventory, and is a key component of efficient distribution operations. Your stock, or lack thereof, can have wide-reaching effects on the rest of the supply chain. Three core parts of inventory management are:\n- Purchasing: Acquiring finished goods awaiting sale or raw materials required to produce your product – the beginning of the inventory management process. - Storage: Housing your inventory before it is sold. Businesses use inventory control practices to manage inventory levels and optimize supply levels. Tools such as regular inventory counts, optimizing shipping locations and automation are ways to improve your inventory storage efforts. - Delivery: The last stage of inventory management – shipping your product to the customer. Logistics play a key role here, because evidence shows that one of the quickest ways to lose customers is through unreliable or late deliveries. Overall, inventory planning helps you avoid three major problems: stockouts, overstocking and inefficient processes. Doing regular stock counts and leveraging technology are key to efficient inventory planning. Other processes – determining your organization’s economic order quantity (or EOQ), demand forecasting, consistent employee training, quality control and more – are additional ways to prevent inventory issues. Common inventory challenges today\nThere are dozens of factors that affect your ability to manage your inventory. Common inventory management problems include:\n- Low cash flow: Holding too much inventory ties up cash that could be used in other areas of the business. - Need to bring inventory in-house: Using a third-party for your supply chain operations makes sense for some businesses. However, operational changes or business growth sometimes require you to reduce or eliminate outsourcing. Adopting best practices for inventory management will allow you to oversee your supply chain efficiently. - Stockouts or overstocking: If you have low visibility or inefficient inventory control practices, poor demand forecasting can lead to too much or too little stock on your shelves. This can lead to lost revenue. - Adding new products: Adding new products to your warehouse shelves without a system in place to locate and organize your stock can result in confusion and disorganization. Using a warehouse inventory management system, including barcoding and scanning, reduces error and increases efficiency. - Little to no reporting: If you aren’t tracking your sales and operations, you’re missing out on critical data. Good inventory planning relies on up-to-date information in order to make accurate forecasting decisions. Cost reduction strategies in inventory management\nFrom capital spent on purchasing to overhead for warehouse storage and shipping costs to deliver goods to customers, there are a lot of opportunities to reduce costs when it comes to inventory management. Dependable cost reduction strategies in inventory management include:\n- Quality control: Not only do you want to offer customers the best product, but you also want their quality to be consistent. Quality control practices help you monitor batches of inventory, make better sales order decisions, meet regulatory requirements and more, which in turn can lessen business costs. - Shipping location optimization: You can use third-party distribution as a means to fill orders, such as distribution centers, in order to hold inventory closer to the customer can reduce costs in order to earn the lowest cost and fastest delivery. - Regular inventory counts: Maintaining regularity when it comes to counting your inventory through a streamlined process attempts to identify and prevent issues before they occur. You can automate this process within an inventory management system. - Economic order quantity: EOQ is a formula for ordering inventory based on the ideal order quantity.\n\nWhile you will count losses, you will be a lesson wiser on what’s not to stock in the future. Better still, you can seek to understand why a particular product is not moving and make the necessary changes. Learning How to Manage Inventories Effectively Should Be a Priority for Any Businessperson\nYour inventories can break your business if not well-controlled. With proper inventory management, you can have efficient record keeping, reduce stock-outs, and manage processes in multiple locations. Now that you know how to manage inventories, explore our site further for more informative business articles.\n\nSound inventory management techniques are the foundation for strategic procurement, enabling you to:\nChoosing the right inventory management processes that suit your dental practice is not a simple task, and the more your business grows, the more difficult managing your inventory can be. That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.\n\nYour (management) mileage may vary\nWhile these are the basics of inventory management for any company, the exact practices vary widely based on the industry and the product involved. A fast fashion company has to sell all of the season’s inventory within a very limited time or risk having to sell the overstock at a steeply discounted price. On the other hand, an auto parts manufacturer can keep their stock on hand longer as the demand for their product does not diminish so quickly outside of the season during which it was produced. Similarly, a beverage manufacturer has different inventory needs as either of the above examples since their product must be stored at a certain temperature and be sold before the sell by date. On a balance sheet, inventory is a current asset since the company will sell the finished product in the near future, depending on the type of product. However, this does require that companies keep careful counts of their current inventory to ensure that there are no errors in their accounting. Typically, companies use either first-in-first-out (FIFO) costing, last-in-first-out (LIFO) costing, or weighted-average costing to account for their inventory. The 4 types of inventory\nIn accounting, company’s inventory will fall into one of the following four categories:\nRaw materials are what a company uses to produce its goods. A company can either purchase and process the raw materials itself or outsource that work to a manufacturer. As the name implies, works-in-progress are the raw materials in the process of becoming finished products. They include the cost of the raw materials as well as other costs such as packaging, labor, and shipping. This type of inventory is a good that finished with production and is ready to be sold to customers\nMany people confuse merchandise with finished goods as they are both finished products that are available to consumers. However, merchandise differs in that it was purchased as a finished good from a different company than the one that intends to sell it. Inventory management techniques and best practices\nThough inventory management is a highly customizable system of practices, certain measures should be taken to minimize human error and reduce the chances of costly mistakes. Below is a list of procedures that will help any business, regardless of size or industry, to streamline their inventory control and improve efficiency. Set par levels\nPar levels are the minimum quantity of a product that you have in stock. If a product quantity falls below the par level, it’s time to buy more. This measure helps to ensure that a company is never out of stock of any particular item and can meet customer demand in a timely manner. These levels should not be set arbitrarily, however. Forecasting can help you to determine the minimum amount of product that you should have on hand at all times. This number may fluctuate by season so attention should be given to future conditions. Par levels should also be set according to the quantities of raw materials it takes to produce a finished good. These numbers should not get too high above the minimum, though, as doing so can unnecessarily tie up capital that would be better spent elsewhere. Establishing reorder points\nClosely related to par levels, an order point is the time when you replenish your stock, but unlike par levels, reorder points have to take into account shipping times and potential delays. When doing so, it is in good practice to order “safety stock”, a level of extra stock that is maintained to mitigate the risk of disruptions in the supply chain. Determining reorder points manually can be tedious, but inventory management software can automate this process to help make your inventory restocking more efficient. If inventory control is a system of maintaining enough inventory to supply a demand, then it follows that accurate forecasting of future demand is a crucial part of successful inventory management. Forecasting uses historical data of production, sales, and demand planning to infer the necessary inventory level at a certain future time. Countless variables need to be taken into account, including market trends, market growth, seasonality, consumer surveys, and more. Though the process can be time consuming, an accurate estimate of future inventory needs can help avoid the problems associated with overstock and out-of-stock and can help ensure timely fulfillment. Use ABC analysis\nABC analysis, or activity-based costing, is a practice that helps to determine the value of your stock based on what percentage of your revenue it generates. This helps a business to prioritize certain types of stock based on how profitable it is.\n\n### Question: What's the best way to manage inventory for a service business?","passages":[{"passage":"Do not be scared to request a lower minimum order quantity to avoid carrying as much inventory. A healthy connection is about more than being pleasant. It all comes down to practical, proactive communication. Notify your supplier when you anticipate a spike in sales or a high volume of purchase orders so they can adapt production accordingly. Request that they warn you when a product is running late so that you can suspend promotions or find a temporary replacement. 5. Physical inventory\nA physical inventory, also known as a stock take, is the process of counting all of your goods simultaneously. After the fiscal year, many businesses do this to coincide with accounting and income tax reporting. Although physical inventories usually are performed once a year, they may be pretty disruptive to corporate operations, and they are tedious. If you do discover a disparity, it can be challenging to narrow down the source of the error when looking back over a whole year. How To Develop an Inventory Action Plan\nBecause inventory storage is costly, businesses are frequently irritated when products collect dust on shelves rather than customers’ purchasing and generating income. While dusting the shelves adds extra effort, it’s not nearly as awful as dealing with a disgruntled customer because you’ve run out of his favorite product. Inventory stock plans are intended to avert one of these outcomes. Step 1: Ascertain Demand\nAn intelligent inventory plan’s first rule is to stock things that customers desire and that statistics indicate are likely to be purchased. This can be determined using historical sales data, which can be obtained by tracking sales over time and logging the results in a database. Sell an average of 30 cartons of milk per day, with steady demand throughout the week. Your inventory control strategy should allow you to meet that demand while also avoiding excessive inventory. Under certain conditions, you may also wish to keep select items in stock, even if an order is weaker or less predictable. For instance, if a critical spare part for an appliance you sell is challenging to obtain promptly, stocking a limited supply can be a prudent business option. Suppose ordering that position at the last minute is prohibitively expensive, and its absence causes customers to switch providers. In that case, the storage costs may be negligible about the costs of not having it when needed. Step 2: Create a Plan for Replenishment\nSupply chain management is essential to the success of any inventory management strategy. Determine your reorder points, the time required for inventory to arrive, and any potential impediments. For example, a just-in-time inventory system works best when you are confident that you can obtain required goods promptly if necessary. Establish a broad replacement schedule for things you will require frequently. This could include daily deliveries of perishables to monthly shipments of non-perishables. Additionally, consider when you need stock replenishment on an Irregular Schedule and the associated costs. Step 3: Maintain Inventory Control\nThe tracking methods of an inventory system are only as good as the system itself. Ideally, use a point-of-sale software system to catalog your inventory and track changes in real-time, and train your personnel to use it at all times. This can be difficult in a Small Firm that prepares completed items using materials from a central inventory base, such as a restaurant, but it is still necessary. Each time a customer puts an order, keep track of which ingredients go into a meal or what goes into a complete cabinet and drain those items from your inventory. Step 4: Monitor and Adjust\nPeriodically re-examine your inventory control system to ensure that the basic assumptions remain valid. If you find that you are suddenly out of corn chips with each inventory cycle – yet have more salsa than you require – your initial demand projections may have been incorrect. Changing the order quantity for each item might help return your inventory levels to their optimal state. Developing a liquidation strategy for unsold inventory can help you move it out of storage and maximize the use of available space. For instance, end-of-season discount sales might help clear out inventory in a retail business that would otherwise linger in stock for an extended time. How do you keep track of your inventory? The easiest inventory tracking method is to manually count your stock every two weeks and compare it to sales. This is referred to as periodic inventory. Additionally, perpetual inventory utilizes an inventory management app or software incorporated with your business’s point of sale system.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a635d65-91b5-4cbb-818d-e594037efb57>"]},{"passage":"Inventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren’t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can’t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that’s why storing them for long isn’t advisable. What’s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today’s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you’ll know if it’s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you’ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn’t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that’s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don’t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1f97aaec-d661-4b13-8d62-718165e892c7>"]},{"passage":"Inventory management is an essential part of doing business, whether you’re a Fortune 500 company or a mom-and-pop shop. It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:31ac7c02-c97c-4d91-bd63-2eef3918c997>"]},{"passage":"A marketing communication plan is an essential tool for any firm.

Inventory planning enables businesses to purchase the appropriate amount of goods and determine how frequently to replenish. Inventory planning assists in lowering the cost of stocking things and ensuring that there is sufficient stock for manufacturing and selling items. Inventory management is a significant component of supply chain management. According to research, the 80\/20 rule implies that 80% of outcomes originate from 20% of efforts, customers, or another unit of measurement. When applied to inventories, the rule means that businesses generate approximately 80% of their revenues from 20% of their products. Benefits of Inventory Planning\nInventory control and planning are two processes part of inventory management. Planning and controlling are critical to management success, as with every management process. The rationale for such a strong emphasis on inventory is that it typically represents a corporation’s most significant cash-flow component. This is true for both purchasing and selling merchandise. As a result, inventory management directly impacts the organization’s financial health. Inventory control and planning benefit small firms in the following ways:\nInventory Management Strategies\nInventory management is a highly adaptable aspect of the company. Each business has a unique inventory control strategy. However, every organization should seek to eliminate human error as much as possible from inventory management, which includes utilizing inventory management software. Regardless of the method you employ, the following will help you manage your inventory more effectively—and increase your cash flow. 1. Six Sigma\nSix Sigma is a methodology and toolkit for enhancing business processes. It is used in inventory and supply chain management to minimize excess and obsolete write-offs. This inventory is frequently sold below cost or donated, which results in a loss of revenue for small business owners. Having the appropriate stock to meet demand minimizes waste and variation issues. Six Sigma is an excellent way of resolving inventory issues. It is orderly and dependable. 2. Set par levels\nSet par levels for each of your goods to simplify inventory management. Par levels are the bare minimum amount of product that must always be on hand. When your inventory falls below certain specified levels, it’s time to place more orders. Ideally, you’ll order the smallest quantity necessary to return above par. Par levels vary by product and determine the speed of an item sells and the time required to restock. While establishing par levels needs some study and decision-making upfront, they will streamline the ordering process. Not only will this make decision-making more accessible for you, but it will also empower your team to make decisions on your behalf. Bear in mind that circumstances change over time. Verify par levels many times a year to ensure they remain reasonable. Meanwhile, don’t be scared to tweak your par levels upward or below. First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a critical inventory management philosophy. This means that your oldest stock is sold first (first in), not your newest store. This is critical for perishable products to avoid unsellable spoiling. Additionally, FIFO is an intelligent technique for non-perishable products. If the same boxes are constantly relegated to the back, they are more prone to wear out. Also, packaging design and functionalities frequently evolve. You don’t want to ramble up with something any longer marketable. To handle a FIFO system effectively, you’ll need a well-organized warehouse. This often entails adding fresh items from the back or otherwise ensuring that existing inventory remains initially. If you’re operating with a warehousing and fulfillment provider, they’re likely already doing this, but it’s prudent to confirm. 4. Relationship management\nSuccessful inventory management requires the ability to adapt fast. Whether you need to return a slow-selling item to make place for a new product, swiftly replenish a high-volume seller, solve manufacturing concerns, or temporarily extend your storage space, it’s critical to maintain a solid relationship with your suppliers. In this manner, they’ll be more receptive to collaborating with you to resolve issues. Maintaining a positive relationship with your product suppliers, in particular, is critical. Frequently, minimum order amounts are negotiable.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a635d65-91b5-4cbb-818d-e594037efb57>"]},{"passage":"Effective Forecasting\nForecasting is central to inventory management. You need to predict the availability of supplies and your customer’s demands. Your inventory management needs to integrate with your business. Understand the seasons and the impact they have on your business. Will the Christmas and New Year holidays affect your product’s demand? Focus on products that are fast-moving during specific events. Research if there are any upcoming marketing events or fairs in your region. You are likely to sell more items than usual. For this reason, you might need to have a higher stock of specific products based on the type of event. To learn how to manage inventories effectively, you need precise predictions. Take advantage of the influx of customers during high peak seasons. Your business will benefit from the approach. 6. Note the Minimum Stock Level\nYou need to know the minimum stock level for timely reorders. Allowing your stock levels to go low has adverse effects on production. Understand how to go about determining the minimum stock level for smooth inventory. One of the factors to consider is the nature of the material. If you get your materials from one supplier, fixing the stock level might be unnecessary. But if you have several suppliers, you need to maintain the minimum stock level to sustain production. You ought to analyze the lead time. For a shorter lead time, the reorder level should remain constant. The longer lead times affect the supply chain because of the changing variability and demand. 7. The Pareto Principle\nStreamlining your inventory management is not a straightforward process. The scattered and varied nature of inventory makes its organization complex. The 80\/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, can enhance the efficiency of inventory control. The 80\/20 rule is an invaluable framework in controlling the flow of your inventory. Simply put, the 80\/20 rule means that 20% of your inventory is responsible for 80% of your profits. Your top sellers are 20%, which keeps you in business even during tough seasons. When you understand the Pareto principle, you’ll know the products that need prioritizing. Give extra attention to your top products. Monitor the stock and have these products in an easily accessible area. You will know how to manage inventories effectively once you understand the significance of the 80\/20 rule. The insights will enable you to make informed decisions on suppliers. Your top-products supplier should be reliable enough. 8. Quality Control\nQuality control is a crucial part of any business. The quality control tools in place can lead to business growth and customer satisfaction. Have a checklist so that your team can assist in confirming the quality of supplies. You can check for any signs of damage such as broken seals, tears, or leaks. Raise the issue with your supplier as you identify the damage. Selling an item that has any signs of tear can damage your credibility as the seller. Confirm the product sizes, styles, and colors. Your order should match your description. Ensure that you also confirm the prices. Maintain high-quality standards to increase your sales and satisfy your customers. Confirm the lighting, temperature, and humidity of your warehouse. Poor storage can undermine the quality of goods, whether perishable or non-perishable. Amazon’s shipping costs for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.6 billion. The expenses involved in storing and shipping products can be high. That’s why dropshipping can be an ideal way of managing your inventory more affordably. Drop-shipping allows you to sell products without necessarily holding them in your warehouse. When a consumer buys an item from your store, the manufacturer or wholesaler can do the inventory and shipping. This approach can be cost-effective because you won’t have to incur expenses on storage and several inventory processes. Dropshipping is one of the inventory methods adopted by online retailers. One inevitable problem with drop shipping is minimal involvement. For that reason, customer satisfaction might be unachievable. If a manufacturer delivers a defective product, your credibility as the seller is at stake. 10. Note the Low Turn Stock\nDo you have a product that has been lying in your warehouse for more than six months? It’s time to reconsider whether it is worth stocking the item. The more such things stay on the shelf, the more their value reduces. The excess stock is a wastage of your precious store. Consider having a promotional sale to get rid of such items. You can sell them at a 50% discount to attract more customers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1f97aaec-d661-4b13-8d62-718165e892c7>"]},{"passage":"Are you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

With so many inventory management and tracking services on the market, it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs. This article will provide an overview of the different types of services available and discuss the benefits they can offer. What is Inventory Management and Tracking?Inventory management and tracking is a process of managing and tracking inventory items, such as raw materials, parts, and finished products. It is typically done using a software system that tracks the quantity, location, and status of the items in the inventory. This system also helps with the ordering, storage, and delivery of items. The goal of inventory management and tracking is to ensure that a business has enough inventory to meet customer demand while minimizing costs. Benefits of Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesInventory management and tracking services provide businesses with a number of benefits, including improved accuracy and efficiency in managing inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. By using an inventory management system, businesses can track the flow of goods through their warehouses or stores, allowing them to better manage their stock levels. This helps to reduce costs by preventing over-ordering or under-ordering of goods. Additionally, it allows businesses to quickly identify and respond to customer orders or stock shortages. Common Solutions for Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesThere are several common solutions for inventory management and tracking services. These include barcoding systems, RFID technology, and software-based inventory systems. Barcoding systems are used to track inventory items by scanning barcodes on the items. RFID technology uses radio frequencies to track the location and status of items. Software-based systems provide an automated way to manage inventory by tracking item information, such as quantity, location, and status. Best Practices for Implementing Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesWhen implementing an inventory management system, there are several best practices that should be followed. First, businesses should define the scope of their inventory management system by determining what needs to be tracked. This includes identifying the types of items that need to be tracked, as well as any other information that needs to be recorded such as expiration dates and minimum quantities. Additionally, businesses should choose a system that meets their needs in terms of scalability, ease of use, cost effectiveness, and integration with other systems. Challenges in Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesOne of the main challenges with inventory management and tracking services is maintaining accurate data. If data is inaccurate or incomplete, it can lead to incorrect decisions being made about stock levels or customer orders. To prevent this from happening, businesses should ensure they have processes in place for verifying data accuracy on a regular basis.

As your business grows or changes, so do your processes for inventory management. Below we review the basics of inventory management, common challenges companies are facing today, cost reduction strategies, and why and when to consider new inventory management software. What is inventory management? Inventory management is the process of ordering, storing and delivering products in the form of finished goods or raw materials for manufacturers. It’s all about balance – having the right product in the right quantity at the right time in the right place at the right cost. Role within the supply chain\nInventory management is a crucial part of your supply chain. It addresses how you order, maintain and deliver your inventory, and is a key component of efficient distribution operations. Your stock, or lack thereof, can have wide-reaching effects on the rest of the supply chain. Three core parts of inventory management are:\n- Purchasing: Acquiring finished goods awaiting sale or raw materials required to produce your product – the beginning of the inventory management process. - Storage: Housing your inventory before it is sold. Businesses use inventory control practices to manage inventory levels and optimize supply levels. Tools such as regular inventory counts, optimizing shipping locations and automation are ways to improve your inventory storage efforts. - Delivery: The last stage of inventory management – shipping your product to the customer. Logistics play a key role here, because evidence shows that one of the quickest ways to lose customers is through unreliable or late deliveries. Overall, inventory planning helps you avoid three major problems: stockouts, overstocking and inefficient processes. Doing regular stock counts and leveraging technology are key to efficient inventory planning. Other processes – determining your organization’s economic order quantity (or EOQ), demand forecasting, consistent employee training, quality control and more – are additional ways to prevent inventory issues. Common inventory challenges today\nThere are dozens of factors that affect your ability to manage your inventory. Common inventory management problems include:\n- Low cash flow: Holding too much inventory ties up cash that could be used in other areas of the business. - Need to bring inventory in-house: Using a third-party for your supply chain operations makes sense for some businesses. However, operational changes or business growth sometimes require you to reduce or eliminate outsourcing. Adopting best practices for inventory management will allow you to oversee your supply chain efficiently. - Stockouts or overstocking: If you have low visibility or inefficient inventory control practices, poor demand forecasting can lead to too much or too little stock on your shelves. This can lead to lost revenue. - Adding new products: Adding new products to your warehouse shelves without a system in place to locate and organize your stock can result in confusion and disorganization. Using a warehouse inventory management system, including barcoding and scanning, reduces error and increases efficiency. - Little to no reporting: If you aren’t tracking your sales and operations, you’re missing out on critical data. Good inventory planning relies on up-to-date information in order to make accurate forecasting decisions. Cost reduction strategies in inventory management\nFrom capital spent on purchasing to overhead for warehouse storage and shipping costs to deliver goods to customers, there are a lot of opportunities to reduce costs when it comes to inventory management. Dependable cost reduction strategies in inventory management include:\n- Quality control: Not only do you want to offer customers the best product, but you also want their quality to be consistent. Quality control practices help you monitor batches of inventory, make better sales order decisions, meet regulatory requirements and more, which in turn can lessen business costs. - Shipping location optimization: You can use third-party distribution as a means to fill orders, such as distribution centers, in order to hold inventory closer to the customer can reduce costs in order to earn the lowest cost and fastest delivery. - Regular inventory counts: Maintaining regularity when it comes to counting your inventory through a streamlined process attempts to identify and prevent issues before they occur. You can automate this process within an inventory management system. - Economic order quantity: EOQ is a formula for ordering inventory based on the ideal order quantity.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cadbdecf-58c0-4239-978c-748e6b356202>"]},{"passage":"While you will count losses, you will be a lesson wiser on what’s not to stock in the future.

Learning How to Manage Inventories Effectively Should Be a Priority for Any Businessperson\nYour inventories can break your business if not well-controlled. With proper inventory management, you can have efficient record keeping, reduce stock-outs, and manage processes in multiple locations.

That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:30866b38-eaa8-41fc-926a-ec0a418914f8>"]},{"passage":"Your (management) mileage may vary\nWhile these are the basics of inventory management for any company, the exact practices vary widely based on the industry and the product involved. A fast fashion company has to sell all of the season’s inventory within a very limited time or risk having to sell the overstock at a steeply discounted price. On the other hand, an auto parts manufacturer can keep their stock on hand longer as the demand for their product does not diminish so quickly outside of the season during which it was produced. Similarly, a beverage manufacturer has different inventory needs as either of the above examples since their product must be stored at a certain temperature and be sold before the sell by date. On a balance sheet, inventory is a current asset since the company will sell the finished product in the near future, depending on the type of product. However, this does require that companies keep careful counts of their current inventory to ensure that there are no errors in their accounting. Typically, companies use either first-in-first-out (FIFO) costing, last-in-first-out (LIFO) costing, or weighted-average costing to account for their inventory. The 4 types of inventory\nIn accounting, company’s inventory will fall into one of the following four categories:\nRaw materials are what a company uses to produce its goods. A company can either purchase and process the raw materials itself or outsource that work to a manufacturer. As the name implies, works-in-progress are the raw materials in the process of becoming finished products. They include the cost of the raw materials as well as other costs such as packaging, labor, and shipping. This type of inventory is a good that finished with production and is ready to be sold to customers\nMany people confuse merchandise with finished goods as they are both finished products that are available to consumers. However, merchandise differs in that it was purchased as a finished good from a different company than the one that intends to sell it. Inventory management techniques and best practices\nThough inventory management is a highly customizable system of practices, certain measures should be taken to minimize human error and reduce the chances of costly mistakes. Below is a list of procedures that will help any business, regardless of size or industry, to streamline their inventory control and improve efficiency. Set par levels\nPar levels are the minimum quantity of a product that you have in stock. If a product quantity falls below the par level, it’s time to buy more. This measure helps to ensure that a company is never out of stock of any particular item and can meet customer demand in a timely manner. These levels should not be set arbitrarily, however. Forecasting can help you to determine the minimum amount of product that you should have on hand at all times. This number may fluctuate by season so attention should be given to future conditions. Par levels should also be set according to the quantities of raw materials it takes to produce a finished good. These numbers should not get too high above the minimum, though, as doing so can unnecessarily tie up capital that would be better spent elsewhere. Establishing reorder points\nClosely related to par levels, an order point is the time when you replenish your stock, but unlike par levels, reorder points have to take into account shipping times and potential delays. When doing so, it is in good practice to order “safety stock”, a level of extra stock that is maintained to mitigate the risk of disruptions in the supply chain. Determining reorder points manually can be tedious, but inventory management software can automate this process to help make your inventory restocking more efficient. If inventory control is a system of maintaining enough inventory to supply a demand, then it follows that accurate forecasting of future demand is a crucial part of successful inventory management. Forecasting uses historical data of production, sales, and demand planning to infer the necessary inventory level at a certain future time. Countless variables need to be taken into account, including market trends, market growth, seasonality, consumer surveys, and more. Though the process can be time consuming, an accurate estimate of future inventory needs can help avoid the problems associated with overstock and out-of-stock and can help ensure timely fulfillment. Use ABC analysis\nABC analysis, or activity-based costing, is a practice that helps to determine the value of your stock based on what percentage of your revenue it generates. This helps a business to prioritize certain types of stock based on how profitable it is.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16e74f11-2ce4-4123-8c2c-eaac1bb0a1fc>"]}]}
