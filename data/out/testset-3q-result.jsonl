It can be special ordered from Boleslawiec if you don't mind waiting 4-6\nmonths for it. Why does it take so long? Typically, if we order it this month, manufacturer will have it ready for us by the end of next month, and it takes 2 months for the goods to travel by\nwheels and sea from Boleslawiec to Texas. That is roughly 4 months total if everything goes smooth. Sometimes it will take longer than 4 months if the manufacturer is very busy, but it should never\ntake longer than 6 months.

Service Science provides managers and students of the service industries with the quantitative skills necessary to model key decisions and performance metrics associated with services, including the management of resources, distribution of goods and services to customers, and the analysis and design of queueing systems.\nThe book begins with a brief introduction to the service sector followed by an introduction to optimization and queueing modeling, providing the methodological background needed to analyze service systems. Subsequent chapters present specific topics within service operations management, including:\n- Location modeling and districting\n- Resource allocation problems\n- Short- and long-term workforce management\n- Priority services, call center design, and customer scheduling\n- Inventory modeling\n- Vehicle routing\nThe author's own specialized software packages for location modeling, network optimization, and time-dependent queueing are utilized throughout the book, showing readers how to solve a variety of problems associated with service industries. These programs are freely available on the book's related web site along with detailed appendices and online spreadsheets that accompany the book's \"How to Do It in Excel\" sections, allowing readers to work hands-on with the presented techniques.\nExtensively class-tested to ensure a comprehensive presentation, Service Science is an excellent book for industrial engineering and management courses on service operations at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book also serves as a reference for researchers in the fields of business, management science, operations research, engineering, and economics.\nThis book was named the 2010 Joint Publishers Book of the Year by the Institute of Industrial Engineers.\n1.
